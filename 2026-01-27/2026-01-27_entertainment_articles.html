                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Stephen Colbert-hosted late-night show will end on Thursday, May 21, Deadline has confirmed. CBS always said that the series, which has been running since 1993, was going to end in May after it emerged the franchise was being axed. Colbert revealed the news during an appearance on rival talker Late Night with Seth Meyers, which is set to air tonight (January 27) on NBC, per LateNighter. CBS surprisingly canceled the show in July, days after the comedian had called his parent company Paramount Global's settlement of a lawsuit from Donald Trump a “bigfatbribe.” The news came a month before David Ellison's Skydance closed its merger with Paramount. RELATED: Trump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President Execs at the broadcast network stressed that the move was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late-night” and “is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” On Monday night, he said, “I think we can all agree: F*ck ICE,” in response to the killing of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis. Last week, he mocked the idea of Trump's “Board of Peace,” which has seen the president charging people $1B to join. “Now, admittedly, the idea of paying a billion dollars to obey Donald Trump seems a little steep,” Colbert said. “After all, CBS got to do it for just $16M.” RELATED: Stephen Colbert To Be Honored With WGA East's Walter Bernstein Award “I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege to be part of the late-night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show,” he said onstage. Next month, he will receive the Walter Bernstein Award from the Writers Guild of America East and The Late Show will also be vying for another Emmy in September, although this year will face tough competition from Jimmy Kimmel Live!, whose host has faced his own late-night drama this year.

Colbert as a free agent means he will have more power and influence, and to that I say, “Hallelujah.” He and Kimmel will both disappear without anyone even noticing. I also thonk others will notice sunce when the FCC tried to get rid of Kimmel a few months ago lots of people responded and he was back on the air after only a few days off. Then lots of people watched the first show back. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Oscar winner is attached to star in most of them. They include The President is Missing, based on Bill Clinton and James Patterson's best-selling political thriller novel, which is in development at Apple Original Films with Berry starring as President Duncan in a gender swap and RK Films also producing; and Bad Cop, Bad Cop, a Kay Cannon-directed action comedy from HalleHolly and Beau Bauman, in which Berry is set to star alongside Fortune Feimster and Jillian Bell. FX's 'Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette' Casts Erich Bergen & Michael Nathanson In Recurring Roles 'The Last Of Us' Star Kaitlyn Dever Says She's Looking Forward To "Going Back In Time" To Tell Abby's POV As Season 3 Production Nears In TV, Berry is attached to star in Zero F***s, a menopause-themed comedy in development at Peacock from writers Liz Kruger and Carolyn Townsend (Salvation, Charmed) and A+E Studios; and The Patient, a horror drama in the works at HBO with writer Laeta Kalogridis (Another Simple Favor), Maximum Effort and Vertigo. She could also potentially star in revenge drama Mother Doom, from writer Matthew Sand (Deepwater Horizon), which is finalizing a development deal at FX, sources tell Deadline. The film development slate includes three other projects that have Berry on board to star: Sunburn for director Liz Garbus (One Night In Idaho: The College Murders), Family Swap for director Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect) and Parole Officer, which HalleHolly and Imagine landed in a bidding war. Former WME partner Jeter and Berry launched HalleHolly in 2022 with the goal of producing film and television anchored by complex characters that provokes honest conversations while highlighting representation in front and behind the camera. Peacock's Zero F***s, which A+E Studios and Range Studios are co-producing with Universal Television, is described as “a comedy about embracing your second act when you finally stop giving a f**k.” It revolves around three menopausal best friends — one of them played by Berry — dealing with midlife BS who are forced to solve a murder of a friend they couldn't stand. The subject matter is personal to Berry, a big advocate for menopause awareness who launched the Respin Health platform as part of her efforts. HBO's The Patient, based on the novella of the same name by Jasper DeWitt that originated as The Patient That Nearly Drove Me Out of Medicine on Reddit's r/nosleep, is executive produced by Berry and Jeter via HalleHolly, Kalogridis, who will serve as showrunner, Ryan Reynolds' Maximum Effort and Vertigo Entertainment. In the psychological horror story, ambitious young psychiatrist Parker attempts to make a name for himself by treating Josephine Todd (Berry), the famously incurable patient at his hospital. But as he unwinds the mystery of her history, and delves deeper into her troubled mind, terrible things start happening – is she a victim or a predator, cursed or the curse itself? As he gets closer to the truth, he realizes that treating her might cost him his own sanity, or much worse. Jeter originally sold the short story in 2018 while she was an agent at WME in a bidding war with 36 companies pursuing. It was won by Maximum Effort and Vertigo to develop as a feature at pre-Disney merger 20th Century Fox. Years later, after Jeter left WME to team up with Berry, the duo joined Maximum Effort and Vertigo as producers, turned the adaptation into a series and gender-swapped the lead character for Berry to star. Based on a short story by Sean Lewis, FX's Mother Doom centers on Riley who has been retired from the Special Forces for twenty years, but when her son is killed in the line of duty, she goes back into her past to find his murderer and get revenge. HalleHolly's first produced project was the 2024 survival horror movie Never Let Go starring Berry for Lionsgate. It will be followed by the feature Fleur, written/directed by Ellie Foumbi, starring Berry and produced by HalleHolly, Plot Twist and Killer Films, which starts production in Paris on March 16 with AGC Studios financing and handling international sales. The President Is Missing, which was set up at Apple last year, is being written by Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy) and David Chasteen (CIA). Producing are HalleHolly, RK Films' Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum, President Clinton, and Patterson via James Patterson Entertainment (Cross) whose Bill Robinson is executive producing alongside RK Films' Zack Roth. The novel by Clinton and Patterson, who has sold more than 475 million books, was published in 2018 and became a No.1 New York Times bestseller. The duo initially looked to turn it into a movie. The book was eventually set up at Showtime for series development. It went to pilot, starring David Oyelowo, whose production was derailed by the pandemic. Bad Cop, Bad Cop, on which HalleHolly and Beau Bauman's A Good One (Back In Action) are teaming up with Feimster (Zootopia 2) and Bell (Summer of 69), was written by Feimster & James Lee Freeman & Brian Jarvis (Ricky Stanicky), with current revisions by Bell and Feimster, for Cannon to direct. In it, two inept beat cops, Molly (Bell) & Devon (Feimster) get taken under the wing of a badass female detective (Halle Berry), who brings them on the ride along of their lives. It is based on Byrd's 2017 memoir about her son, Christian Haupt. Sunburn, produced by HalleHolly and Garbus and Dan Cogan's Story Syndicate, is based on Laura Lippman's 2018 book of the same name. It's the start of a twisted plan that involves a murder in her past, a hidden stash of millions, and an urge to be free from all the men who have tried to control her. Body-swapping comedy Family Swap, produced by HalleHolly and Gaumont, is based on Gaumont's 2021 French film Le Sens de la famille directed by Jean-Patrick Benes. However, when they all wake up to find that they're in each other's bodies – and when it keeps happening, morning after morning – the chaos continues to escalate. Set into motion by an innocuous wish, the James family is forced to explore their generational differences, intra-marital conflicts, raging hormones, and professional anxieties, in a complicated web of body-swapping madness. Parole Officer, from HalleHolly and Imagine Entertainment, is written by Michael McGrale. The woman (Berry) turns out to be his newly appointed parole officer, who unleashes a plan to blackmail him into committing an escalating series of crimes or else he'll be sent back to prison for the rest of his life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Baby won't be in the corner for much longer as Lionsgate‘s planned Dirty Dancing sequel moves forward. The studio announced Tuesday that producers Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will oversee the feature project that is aiming to begin production later this year. Additionally, Kim Rosenstock (Dying for Sex) is writing the script. Jennifer Grey was previously announced to executive produce and reprise her role of Frances “Baby” Houseman that originated in director Emile Ardolino's 1987 original movie that also starred the late Patrick Swayze. A director has not been announced, as Jonathan Levine, who was previously attached to helm the sequel, is still set to serve as executive producer but will not direct. Steven Mnuchin, Former Trump Treasury Secretary, Joins Lionsgate Board of Directors They are also executive producers on Ryan Murphy's forthcoming FX series Love Story: John F. Kennedy, Jr. and Carolyn Bessette. Jacobson has produced all of the films in the Hunger Games franchise, and her previous feature work with Simpson includes Crazy Rich Asians. “Dirty Dancing remains as beloved today as it was upon its initial release, and we knew that a very special group of people would have to come together for fans to embrace a return to Kellerman's,” Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson says in a statement. I've long wondered where we might find Baby years later and what her life might be like, but it's taken time to assemble the kind of people that I felt could be entrusted to build on the legacy of the original film… and I'm excited to say that It looks like the wait will soon be over!” In her own statement, Jacobson says, “Dirty Dancing is that rare film that is as emotional, exhilarating and rebellious today as it was the year it was released. Meredith Wieck and Maria Ascanio will oversee the Dirty Dancing sequel for Lionsgate. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Sure, meta comedies about moviemaking may not match the ratings of medical dramas or medieval fantasies, but that only makes Marvel‘s decision to focus their latest “superhero” series on a struggling actor who befriends another struggling actor all the more curious. Do genre fans accustomed to CGI space battles and extended easter-egg hunts want to spend four hours watching a non-blue Dr. Manhattan pal around Los Angeles with Sir Ben Kingsley? Will they tolerate an entire episode dedicated to recording a single self-tape? Do they even know what a self-tape is? (For those who don't, it's an audition you record yourself — very popular, somewhat controversial.) Related Stories 2026 ACE Eddie Award Nominees Include ‘F1,' ‘Sinners,' and ‘Weapons' ‘Chasing Summer' Review: Iliza Shlesinger's Sexy but Basic Rom-Com Proves the Old Josephine Decker Is Gone Well, whether “Wonder Man” is a savvy business decision isn't my judgment to render, but having seen the full eight-episode season, it's a surprisingly solid show — earnestly invested not only in its characters but in their work, and refreshingly siloed from the typical MCU hullabaloo (which dragged down so many prior Disney+ shows, Marvel has all but abandoned its serialized slate). Best of all, Andrew Guest and Daniel Destin Cretton's limited series is dependent on and a showcase for its two leads in ways previous Marvel projects only pretended to be. This isn't a case where a couple of affable actors prop up a lousy tentpole, like when Hugh Jackman came back from the dead to legitimize “Deadpool vs. Wolverine,” or when “Captain America: Brave New World” focused on Harrison Ford because it didn't have anything better to do. “Wonder Man” celebrates actors to such an extent it nearly disappears into its own ring light, but thanks to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Ben Kingsley, the one-off sitcom flies high enough to admire these heroes and their story. Simon Williams (Abdul-Mateen) is having a tough day. His big new gig on “American Horror Story” doesn't go as planned. There, watching Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman graciously disappear into their oddball roles, Simon finds peace. He's transported back to his childhood, when his dad would sneak him out of school for a day at the cinema. And then, back in the present, he's introduced to Trevor Slattery (Kingsley), a fellow thespian who's also a deep admirer of John Schlesinger's X-rated classic chronicling an unlikely friendship between two down-on-their luck dudes. You see, years ago, when Trevor was at his lowest, he took a job playing The Mandarin, a terrorist leader whose ominous messages and malicious threats were used as cover for far worse behavior by a far more serious menace. (See: “Iron Man 3.” But also, you know, don't.) After sobering up in prison, Trevor escaped to help Shang Chi (see: “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” which is actually OK) and start his personal rehabilitation process. …except the U.S. government claims he hasn't paid his debt — not in full — so at the start of “Wonder Man,” an agent from the Department of Damage Control (played by “Succession's” Arian Moayed) blackmails Trevor into spying on a new potential danger to society: Simon. That's right: Simon has superpowers — powers he doesn't fully understand and desperately wants to keep hidden, but the DoDC doesn't care about that. They only care that he can create explosions out of thin air and make the earth quake with his mind. Trevor forges a bond with Simon through their shared love of acting, even concocting a scheme to get them into the same audition: a remake of the '80s movie “Wonder Man,” in which Simon would play the titular lead (the studio is looking for a “new face”) and Trevor would play his best friend. Co-creators Guest (who serves as head writer) and Cretton (who directs the first two episodes) rely on those meta dynamics to flesh out their story: When Simon and Trevor work on scenes together, their emotions are right at the surface. The audience doesn't have to make a big leap to see the personal experience they're drawing from, or — more importantly — to appreciate how their shared art-form (acting) helps them become better people who lead better lives. Investing in what they do and how it shapes who they are is critical, and while “Wonder Man” can get a little bogged down in actor-speak, it's still a sincere testimonial to the profession's purest intentions. The series roots itself in the dilemma of chasing fame vs. staying true to yourself, and Guest wisely broadens that Hollywood-centric focus to emphasize more relatable aspects of the journey: Simon isn't a crude glory-hound; he's not obsessed with finding his good side or building up social media followers. He just… might be too dedicated, and discovering why he's so eager to disappear into someone else's life, while still being seen by millions and millions of people, is the key to unlocking his full potential. In lesser hands, this guy could've easily been a dick. Other actors with Abdul-Mateen's wide smile, soft voice, and broad shoulders may have just leaned on their looks to cover up their character's least-likable moments — as if gobs of charm in one scene can erase the ugliness glimpsed in others. But Abdul-Mateen, who certainly has the screen presence to get away with a lot, instead recognizes all of Simon's layers at once. And his selfishness doesn't stem from greed or ego; it's forced on him by the work he does and part of him since he was much, much smaller. Not everything in “Wonder Man” makes as much sense. For a show that claims to know Hollywood as well as this one, there are a number of all-too-convenient gaffes. The pacing isn't always smooth, and a departure episode doesn't fully justify its running time — not when it means leaving out Abdul-Mateen and Kingsley (the latter of whom is having a ball). All eight episodes will be released at once. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After taking them out, I let out a breath of relief and continued on my way until suddenly something struck me from out of nowhere, dealing the last bit of my HP and sending me back to my last checkpoint. As it turns out, Crisol expects players to be careful and precise with the bullets they expend. For one, it clearly borrows from heavy-hitters like Bioshock and Resident Evil. Crisol isn't a twitch first-person shooter, and as such Gabriel, the game's protagonist, moves with weight. It feels like Jack emerging into Rapture's bathosphere for the first time and being thrust into an unexpected battle of survival against a rabid splicer. The points of comparison don't stop there, either. Tormentosa is a storm-drenched island run by competing religious cults; based on trailers, it looks to feature locales that seem inspired by Resident Evil 4‘s mountain village and castle segments. Environmental puzzles have you tracking down key items like bolt cutters in order to open up locked gates, and even the way they are conjured from thin air and used in-game is reminiscent of the Resident Evil titles. But Crisol is also far more of a survival horror game than I expected it to be, and that ties into its most interesting and unique mechanic. In Crisol, the weapons you use to put down opponents are fueled by blood. At one point, I picked up a plain old-fashioned bolt-action sniper rifle that was immediately consumed by blood and made into some blasphemous, gothic armament of war. All of Crisol‘s weapons are like this, and rather than take bullets, they take blood directly from your HP. That means that every reload animation vividly shows the gun draining the player of their life force, and surviving Crisol‘s horrors eventually grows to entail management of your shared health and ammo pool to meet the situation adequately. Shotguns, for example, hold two very powerful shells that one-shot standard enemies, but each takes a pip of your entire health bar. The pistol, by comparison, can hold 10 weaker shots, but each absorbs drastically less health than one shotgun round. In classic survival horror fashion, like Resident Evil, I was almost immediately counting my shots and weighing what I could get away with against my inventory and healing items. To aid the player, Crisol‘s dilapidated city streets are rich with blood. Corpses of fallen men occasionally litter the main pathways, but there are also plenty of mutated animals around too, and both can be consumed by the player to fill their health and tip things back in their favor. I imagine hardcore players can amp up the difficulty in the settings menu and find even fewer of these for a truly harrowing time. According to a producer who was on hand for my demo, many of Crisol‘s enemy variants are born from imagery related to Hispanic culture (the game's developer, Vermila Studios, is based in Madrid) and seem to especially stem from Spanish-Catholic architecture. And while I have no idea how Crisol will execute upon its obvious religious overtones, it is refreshing to see a game move from the abstract realm of religion and the harmfulness of its institutions into the more concrete by rendering material nightmares from its own iconography. Especially if you're low on blood, you may want to do a little risk management instead and take out the legs in order to leave slower crawlers. This frees up ammo to go towards greater targets, and buys you time to scan the environs for healing or sources of blood. The preview also revealed two other enemy types that owe their whole deal to Crisol‘s overtly religious lineage. The other, and far more prominent, enemy was a large unkillable mech called Dolores. When she is deployed, she immediately complicates matters by stalking the room calling for you, which sounds creepy enough in English but manages to be even more menacing in Spanish. At one point, she jump-scared me in a room where I had to solve an environmental puzzle resulting in electrified puddles of water; my progress immediately dragged to a screeching halt as I began having to account for her large presence. There were other enemies in the rooms to take care of, including sentries above me, but every fired shot risked alerting her to my presence, and when she first makes an entrance like she does here, it can be disarming. It seems like Dolores will follow you through a few parts of the game, and I worry that the bit may run dry. She's fairly restricted in her movement and what she can do to harm you, and I worry that segments revolving around her run the risk of growing stale as you repeatedly bait her to one side of a room so that you can then unlock a door somewhere else and bypass her. In order to maintain her viability as a threat, Crisol will hopefully find  greater ways to utilize her as the game goes on. When Crisol leans into its unique cultural elements, it's enthralling. When it's more prosaic and familiar, in settings like factories and plain storefronts, I wished that the developer allowed more of themselves to bleed into the game, similar to how the game's protagonist bleeds for their cause. I have hope yet that Crisol will grow into a stronger display of Spanish culture—its voice acting and loaded enemy design is already most of the way there—but this glimpse at its early moments leads me to believe it might be a slow ramp up to the full-fledged Spanish nightmare that Crisol could be. It does an admirable job lifting from obvious inspirations, though, and the way that it turns familiar survival horror elements on their head with its blood mechanic leaves me wondering what extreme lengths it might still go to.

Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title.

I'll be easing back into things thoughtfully and with care — moving forward one step at a time.” Gilbert broke down in tears last Tuesday when an Albuquerque judge ordered Busfield's release from custody. Busfield, who starred in West Wing and Thirtysomething, was arrested earlier this month on charges of sexual contact with a minor and child abuse. While on set, the 68-year-old allegedly had inappropriate contact with twin child actors, which reportedly began occurring when the boys were around seven years old, according to an arrest warrant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the Rams were knocked out of Super Bowl contention on Sunday, the real winner this year will be… Joe Montana. Sources say that the four-time Super Bowl winning QB usually racks up hundreds of thousands in appearances during a normal Super Bowl. This year, Montana will appear at events at the Orpheum Theatre with fellow football legends and he'll also host a celeb golf tournament with his longtime 49ers teammate Jerry Rice. Said an insider, “Oh, he's definitely gonna be paid” this year, adding that Montana could rake in $100,000 per day at events from Tuesday through Super Bowl Sunday. We hear he's also bringing his four Super Bowl trophies to a pop-up dinner hosted by legendary NYC, LA and Miami red sauce joint Rao's. (We hear Montana is attending this one gratis as a friend of owners Frank Pelligrino Jr and Ron Straci, as well as the “Joe Montana Of Meatballs” exec chef Dino Gatto. But we guess he'll get some free lemon chicken at least.) Rao's will run for five nights for expected guests like Rice, Eli and Peyton Manning, Rob Gronkowski, Troy Aikman and more. Serial entrepreneur and Real SLX founder Kenny Dichter is stirring the sauce, we'll say. A rep for Montana did not get back to us.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another record-breaking feat for Chloé Zhao this awards season: Hamnet is officially BAFTA‘s most-nominated film by a female director ever. Ryan Coogler's deep South vampire horror Sinners follows with 13 nods, shortly after becoming the Academy's most-nominated movie of all time. Her Sam Mendes- and Steven Spielberg-produced Shakespearean drama Hamnet landed 11 BAFTA Film Awards noms, the most for a female filmmaker in BAFTA history. Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel of the same name, Focus Features' Hamnet scored nominations for best film, outstanding British film, as well as best director for Zhao and best adapted screenplay for both Zhao and O'Farrell, who penned the script together. Liza Marshall and Pippa Harris also land noms for their roles as producers. Irish duo Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal also landed lead actress and supporting actor nods, respectively, for their performances as Agnes and William Shakespeare, two characters torn apart by contrasting experiences of grief after the loss of their son. Emily Watson is recognized in the supporting actress category for her role as Shakespeare's mother, and Max Richter is nominated for best original score. Across all categories, 25 percent of the nominated films are directed by women. Among some of the others recognized are Lynne Ramsay's Die My Love (outstanding British film), Kathryn Bigelow's A House of Dynamite (editing) and Mary Bronstein's If I Had Legs I'd Kick You (best actress for Rose Byrne). Some of the other stats from Tuesday's BAFTA nominations are also neat. Skarsgard is undoubtedly the frontrunner in the supporting actor category for his role in Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, though both Infiniti and A'zion missed out on Academy Awards nominations last week.

So grateful our family is safe, but I know a lot of folks are hurting—homes damaged, power out, trees down.

Other reactions include, “We absolutely do take care of our own,” “Praying for Nashville!,” and “Praying for you Tim McGraw and Nashville Tennessee.” Among the reactions is one from McGraw's daughter, Audrey McGraw, who reacted with a red heart emoji. The media, including Fox News, reported that trees had fallen onto electrical lines, leaving thousands without power in Nashville. “More than 245 million Americans across the weekend left a lasting impact on Nashville as thousands remain without power from crippling ice that has overtaken the typically bustling Tennessee town,” Fox News reports. “With temperatures dropping into the single digits tonight, we're especially reminded of the grit and sacrifice it takes after so much destruction across our system,” they wrote. “We are endlessly grateful for the lineworkers' dedication today and every day. There is a sense of community in the post's comment section. You have a nasty job and it's bitterly cold. We are so appreciative of you restoring our power!” a message reads.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lisa Rinna's youngest daughter, Amelia Gray Hamlin, 24, revealed in an interview with Variety that after a former boyfriend encouraged her to get breast implants, the results were so awful that she had to undergo a 14-hour emergency surgery to reconstruct the damage. Hamlin, an established fashion model, explained how after the anesthesia wore off from her surgery, she woke up in shock at the results. “That also turned into a medical emergency surgery because my breasts literally could not handle what were put in me,” she said. I ended up having to get a 14-hour reconstruction surgery.” Hamlin's strikingly beautiful appearance has long been a topic of discussion since she was cast into the spotlight through her soap opera and “RHOBH” star mom. Telling Variety, Hamlin shared that she's never used lip filler despite speculation. “I've always had these lips,” she said, adding that she uses a lip moisturizer that acts as an injection without the filler. During a 2020 “Him and Her” podcast, Hamlin opened up about a different breast procedure that was also done in an emergency. The swelling got so intense that she had to undergo a breast reduction. When explaining what caused the infection, Hamlin said she was at Coachella and got her nipple ring stuck on something, causing her skin to tear open. Her immune system then went into shock when she ate a food that she already knew would negatively impact her health. Although she didn't know how bad the reaction would be, Hamlin said it was the “worst thing I've ever been through.” Before she underwent the breast reduction surgery to repair the infection, a specialist told her she was only “12 hours away from going [into] sepsis.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A little over two weeks after the child sex abuse charges against her husband, Timothy Busfield, were made public, Emmy-nominated actress Melissa Gilbert is “sending you all my love and gratitude during this extraordinarily difficult time.” In a statement that's both her first since her husband's arrest and aesthetically aligned with the Modern Prairie Instagram she posted it to, Gilbert expressed support for Busfield and thanked her followers for supporting the couple. “I'm sending you all my love and gratitude during this extraordinarily difficult time. Not only for Tim, me and our family, but in the collective heaviness so many of us seem to be carrying right now. Add an unexpected storm to the mix, and it can all feel like a bit too much,” a statement from Gilbert read on the Modern Prairie Instagram page. “This season has reminded me, very clearly, how important it is to slow down, prioritize what truly matters, and allow ourselves moments of rest. Stepping back from the noise, the news, and even our daily responsibilities from time to time gives us space to recharge, reflect, and find our center again.” Thank you for helping me to feel safer, more grounded, and deeply held by this extraordinary community of women here at Modern Prairie. I'll be easing back into things thoughtfully and with care – moving forward one step at a time. Busfield, who has faced multiple sexual misconduct allegations since the '90s, surrendered to authorities about two weeks ago, saying that he plans to fight the allegations. “I'm going to confront these lies,” he said in a video declaring his innocence. They're all lies, and I did not do anything to those little boys.
