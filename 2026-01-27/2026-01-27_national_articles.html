                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump met with Noem for nearly two hours last night, according to sources. • Leadership shakeup: Border czar Tom Homan is now in Minnesota and has met with Gov. Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents are expected to leave Minneapolis today, sources said, amid backlash against the immigration crackdown in the state. • Shift in tone: Trump said he does not believe Alex Pretti was an “assassin,” and he'll be “watching over” the investigation into the ICU nurse's fatal shooting. Meanwhile, first lady Melania Trump has called for unity in a rare interview. • Judge's order: Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has been ordered to appear in federal court on Friday by a Minnesota judge to explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating an order in the case of a man challenging his detention. Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents are expected to leave Minneapolis today, sources said. Some Minnesotans tell CNN that they are glad to see him go, but are apprehensive about whether anything will change. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team said that House Democrats will launch impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if she is not fired by President Donald Trump, a major escalation in the party leaders' position. “Kristi Noem should be fired immediately, or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives,” the trio of Democratic leaders wrote. Up until Pretti was killed in Minneapolis over the weekend, Jeffries had been trying to keep his options open and was trying to steer his party away from a rushed impeachment effort. But the number of House Democrats signing onto an impeachment effort against Noem only continued to grow. Video obtained by The Associated Press show a chaotic scene just moments after Alex Pretti was shot on Saturday. Some federal agents and emergency responders can be seen attempting to administer aid to Pretti as he lays on the ground. “I understand but you have to stay out of the way,” an agent replies. The scene continues to unfold as emergency responders arrive and one person begins chest compressions on Pretti. “Why don't you be quiet please?” one agent says. Agents then attempt to keep bystanders back as police begin putting up yellow caution tape around the scene. President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation's growth rate as the US population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the US Census Bureau. If trends continue, the gain from immigrants in mid-2026 will drop to only 321,000 people, according to the Census Bureau, whose estimates do not distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. The jump in immigration two years ago was partly because of a new method of counting that added people who were admitted for humanitarian reasons. “They do reflect recent trends we have seen in out-migration, where the numbers of people coming in is down and the numbers going out is up,” Eric Jensen, a senior research scientist at the Census Bureau, said last week. President Donald Trump said today that he does not believe Alex Pretti was acting as an “assassin” in Minneapolis, the most direct contradiction he's made yet of how some members of his administration described Pretti in the immediate aftermath of his killing. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump was asked about the “assassin” description, which was used on Saturday by deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. “With that being said, you can't have guns. After Pretti was shot to death on Saturday, Miller referred to him as “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents,” a claim Vice President JD Vance reposted on social media. Miller was among those who boarded Marine One with Trump on Tuesday as the president headed to Iowa for a speech. At the White House on Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought to put distance between those comments and Trump's feelings. President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his homeland security secretary Tuesday, telling reporters at the White House that Kristi Noem is not stepping down. CNN reported earlier today that Trump met for nearly two hours with Noem and her senior adviser Monday night, as she and the department face backlash over their response to the shooting of another US citizen at the hands of federal agents. The president said that “she's doing a very good job” when asked again later about Noem. “He's meeting with the governor, and he's meeting with the mayor, I think later, and I hear that's all going very well,” Trump said. Walz's office said earlier today he met with Homan and the two “agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue.” President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for an “honorable and honest” investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and said he'd be “watching over it.” Asked Tuesday whether he believed Pretti's death was justified, the president indicated that he would be involved with the investigation. I want a very honorable and honest investigation. The president struck a more moderate tone than many of his top lieutenants, some of whom have cast Pretti as a “domestic terrorist.” There has been a shift in tone and strategy from the White House over the past day, with Trump announcing on Monday that he was sending border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis to replace Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino on the ground. Tim Walz's office said he met with White House border czar Tom Homan today and the two “agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue.” Walz and Homan “will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday,” the governor's office said. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety will be the primary liaison with Homan in ensuring those goals are met, Walz's office noted. Some background: President Donald Trump and Walz spoke by phone yesterday in what they both described as a productive conversation. In a separate statement, Walz said Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and pledged to talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring that state officials can investigate Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. Sources told CNN that top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents are expected to leave the city today, with border czar Tom Homan being dispatched there in his place. CNN's Jeff Winter, Priscilla Alvarez, Kit Maher, Alayna Treene, Betsy Klein, Kaanita Iyer, Arlette Saenz and Martin Goillandeau contributed to this reporting. Federal immigration officers have been collecting personal information about protesters and agitators in Minneapolis, sources told CNN — and had documented details about Alex Pretti before he was shot to death on Saturday. It is unclear how Pretti first came to the attention of federal authorities, but sources told CNN that about a week before his death, he suffered a broken rib when a group of federal officers tackled him while he was protesting their attempt to detain other individuals. The earlier incident started when he stopped his car after observing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents chasing what he described as a family on foot, and began shouting and blowing his whistle, according to a source who asked not to be named out of fear of retribution. Pretti later told the source that five agents tackled him, and one leaned on his back — an encounter that left him with a broken rib. Pretti was later given medication consistent with treating a broken rib, according to records reviewed by CNN. DHS did not respond to questions about Pretti's previous encounter or more details about efforts to collect information on protesters. A memo sent earlier this month to agents temporarily assigned to the city asked them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,” according to correspondence reviewed by CNN. While a Minnesota judge waits for acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons to appear in federal court this week to answer questions about violating the judge's order, the man in the case is “suffering” in ICE custody, his attorney said. Juan Hugo Tobay Robles filed a habeus corpus petition on January 8 challenging his detention, according to court documents. Robles is currently detained at El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas. Robles was detained by ICE agents in Minnesota on January 6, according to Ojala-Barbour. “He was pulled over on the freeway and arrested by 12 to 13 agents. Judge Patrick Schiltz, the chief district judge in Minnesota, said in a court filing yesterday that “The Court's patience is at an end,” and that Lyons must appear in court Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the a judge's order. Lyons, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and David Easterwood, the acting ICE director in the St. Paul field office, have failed to comply with “dozens of court orders” in recent weeks, Schiltz said in the filing, including scheduling a bond hearing for Robles. “What has unfolded in Minneapolis this past month betrays our most basic values as Americans. We are not a nation that guns down our citizens in the street. We are not a nation that allows our citizens to be brutalized for exercising their constitutional rights. We are not a nation that tramples the 4th Amendment and tolerates our neighbors being terrorized,” he said in a post on X today. Biden praised the people of Minnesota for their resilience after the deaths of Good and Pretti, saying they have “reminded us all what it is to be American, and they have suffered enough at the hands of this Administration.” “Violence and terror have no place in the United States of America, especially when it's our own government targeting American citizens. No single person can destroy what America stands for and believes in, not even a President, if we — all of America — stand up and speak out,” he said. Despite subzero temperatures in Minneapolis, mourners continue to gather to honor Alex Pretti and Renee Good at their respective memorials. The locations where Pretti and Good were fatally shot by federal agents are close to each other and not far from where George Floyd was killed by law enforcement in 2020.

Other top Trump officials, including chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt and communications director Steven Cheung, also attended the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. What DHS is saying: Asked about the meeting on Fox News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said today that Trump and Noem have “had at-length discussions.” She said: “I can't get into those specifics, but Secretary Noem will continue to oversee, of course, the Department of Homeland Security.” McLaughlin said that Noem is “very happy” that border czar Tom Homan will be overseeing immigration operations in Minneapolis. CNN's Kaanita Iyer, Daniel Dale, Priscilla Alvarez, Michael Williams, Holmes Lybrand and Aaron Blake contributed to this report. “At the Olympics, ICE's Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,” McLaughlin told CNN in a statement. According to the Associated Press, citing sources, federal agencies have supported security for US diplomats in previous Olympics, including Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of ICE. Meanwhile, the chairmen of the Senate and House Homeland Security Committees – Paul and Rep. Andrew Garbarino – are calling for top immigration officials to testify to Congress. And GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York penned a New York Times op-ed calling for “congressional scrutiny” and an “an immigration plan that settles the issue.” “After 40 years of failure — and, now, two more deaths that did not need to occur — my colleagues and I should feel only more profoundly the responsibility to rebuild trust and act in America's common interest,” the congressman wrote. This post has been updated with additional information. CNN's Aaron Blake and Annie Grayer contributed to this post. One organizer told CNN that people are singing to “grieve,” “feel rage” and “strengthen (themselves).” Watch Anderson Cooper's interview with that organizer below: What began with a small group singing in freezing temperatures has grown into a movement in Minneapolis, where hundreds are gathering to use protest songs as a way to grieve, express fear, and find courage. The speech is Trump's only public engagement today, and it follows yesterday's self-described “great conversations” with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. I had Jacob Frey and I had Governor Walz,” Trump said this morning on WABC radio's “Sid & Friends In The Morning.” “They were great calls, so let's see how they're reported. He indicated that a compromise of some kind can be reached regarding immigration enforcement action in the state, emphasizing how the goal is to target criminal undocumented immigrants. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin declined to peel back Secretary Krisi Noem's characterization of Alex Pretti's actions on Saturday as domestic terrorism. McLaughlin deferred to the investigation led by the department and FBI, as well as the internal Customs and Border Patrol review, when pressed in an interview on Fox News Tuesday morning, claiming that Pretti obstructed a federal immigration operation. “In this situation, we have seen on the ground in Minneapolis a highly coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement,” McLaughlin said. “In this case, we saw an individual who, he was armed. He got into a physical altercation with law enforcement. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and in video analyzed by CNN, he is not seen brandishing his weapon at federal agents. Video also shows that Pretti was disarmed before a Border Patrol agent shot him multiple times. “You have the right to practice your first amendment, of course, and your second amendment rights, but do so responsibly and without breaking federal law,” McLaughlin said. Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman is calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to be fired. In a social media post appealing directly to President Donald Trump, Fetterman called for the president to “immediately fire” Noem. She (Noem) is betraying DHS's core mission and trashing your border security legacy,” Fetterman wrote. “DO NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary,” he said, referring to Alejandro Mayorkas.</p>

Mike Lawler of New York penned a New York Times op-ed calling for “congressional scrutiny” and an “an immigration plan that settles the issue.” “After 40 years of failure — and, now, two more deaths that did not need to occur — my colleagues and I should feel only more profoundly the responsibility to rebuild trust and act in America's common interest,” the congressman wrote. CNN's Aaron Blake and Annie Grayer contributed to this post. One organizer told CNN that people are singing to “grieve,” “feel rage” and “strengthen (themselves).” What began with a small group singing in freezing temperatures has grown into a movement in Minneapolis, where hundreds are gathering to use protest songs as a way to grieve, express fear, and find courage. The speech is Trump's only public engagement today, and it follows yesterday's self-described “great conversations” with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. I had Jacob Frey and I had Governor Walz,” Trump said this morning on WABC radio's “Sid & Friends In The Morning.” “They were great calls, so let's see how they're reported. He indicated that a compromise of some kind can be reached regarding immigration enforcement action in the state, emphasizing how the goal is to target criminal undocumented immigrants. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin declined to peel back Secretary Krisi Noem's characterization of Alex Pretti's actions on Saturday as domestic terrorism. McLaughlin deferred to the investigation led by the department and FBI, as well as the internal Customs and Border Patrol review, when pressed in an interview on Fox News Tuesday morning, claiming that Pretti obstructed a federal immigration operation. “In this situation, we have seen on the ground in Minneapolis a highly coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement,” McLaughlin said. “In this case, we saw an individual who, he was armed. He got into a physical altercation with law enforcement. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and in video analyzed by CNN, he is not seen brandishing his weapon at federal agents. Video also shows that Pretti was disarmed before a Border Patrol agent shot him multiple times. “You have the right to practice your first amendment, of course, and your second amendment rights, but do so responsibly and without breaking federal law,” McLaughlin said. Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman is calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to be fired. In a social media post appealing directly to President Donald Trump, Fetterman called for the president to “immediately fire” Noem. She (Noem) is betraying DHS's core mission and trashing your border security legacy,” Fetterman wrote. “DO NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary,” he said, referring to Alejandro Mayorkas. Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons has been ordered to appear in federal court this Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating a judge's order in the case of a man challenging his detention. The administration's anti-immigration efforts have sparked widespread protests in Minneapolis, particularly after the fatal shooting of two US citizens by federal agents. The judge said Lyons, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and David Easterwood, the acting ICE director in the St. Paul field office have failed to comply with “dozens of court orders” in recent weeks. Schiltz pointed to a January 14 order, in which the court ordered Lyons, Noem and Easterwood to provide a man in ICE detention with a bond hearing within seven days or release him from custody. “The practical consequence of respondents' failure to comply has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong),” Schiltz wrote in Monday's filing. President Donald Trump said that he had “great conversations” with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. I had Jacob Frey and I had Governor Walz,”Trump said Tuesday morning on WABC radio's “Sid & Friends in the Morning.” “They were great calls, so let's see how they're reported. Trump indicated that a compromise of some kind can be reached, emphasizing how the goal is to target criminal undocumented immigrants. And if you give us the criminals, it all goes away,” Trump said. I know my husband, the president, had a great call yesterday with the governor and the mayor, and they're working together to make it peaceful and without riots,” Trump told Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt. It has been extremely rare for Trump to address current events during President Donald Trump's second term but the first lady appeared on Fox News from the White House ahead of the Friday release of her eponymous documentary. So if, please if you protest, protest in peace, and we need to unify in these times,” Trump said. Her comments come amid a significant shift in tone from the White House this week as CNN reported that border czar Tom Homan was being dispatched to Minneapolis, with Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino expected to depart the city. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Walz had called him “with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota.” Describing the discussion as “very good,” the president said that he and Walz “actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength.” “I told Governor Walz that I would have (border czar) Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future,” Trump wrote, adding that Walz is “happy” Homan is going to Minnesota. For his part, Walz said that Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in his state, and that the president also pledged to talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring state officials can investigate Saturday's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti. Trump has called for more cooperation from Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities. “The Governor reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a US citizen,” Walz's office said in a readout of the call. CNN's Kit Maher and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this reporting. Video from the Associated Press showed dozens of protesters gathered at the SpringHill Suites in Maple Grove, where they believed top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino was staying. “Property damage occurred and objects were thrown at officers.” Police issued a dispersal order and “those who failed to comply with lawful orders or committed crimes were arrested,” the statement said, before the crowd dispersed by 10 p.m. CNN has reached out to CBP and the DHS for more information.</p>

Longtime Minnesota Vikings announcer Paul Allen said that he is taking a few days off from his radio show after making comments about "paid protesters" on Friday. KFAN's Allen wondered if those protesting in the extreme cold were getting hazard pay. "In conditions like this, do paid protesters get hazard pay? Those are the things that I've been thinking about this morning," Allen said on Friday.

Allen referenced the paid protesters again when he mentioned people who were catching strays. (Vikings defensive coordinator Brian) Flores, Kevin Stefanski from Baker (Mayfield), Charlie ‘Biyatch' caught one out of nowhere. They're just all over, paid protesters caught one this morning," Allen said, referencing his earlier comments. Allen's comments came before a Border Patrol-involved shooting left one dead in Minnesota over the weekend. "I have to stop watching all this for a little bit. I'm so sad this terror is happening all around us here in MN," Allen posted on X. Minnesota Vikings radio commentator Paul Allen looks on before the NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 4, 2026.

I made a comment on air Friday about protesters and the weather that was insensitive and poorly timed. And while it was never meant with any ill intent or political affront, I absolutely and wholeheartedly want to apologize to those who genuinely were hurt or offended by it," Allen said.

From 1992 until 2014, Derek Jeter was with the New York Yankees. Not including spring training, Jeter totaled 3,210 games at all levels of the Yankees organization. Growing up, it was the only team he wanted to play for. But there was a time when he did wear another jersey, and he even wore it against his beloved pinstripes. Derek Jeter at bat against the New York Yankees during an exhibition game between the New York Yankees and the USA Baseball team at George Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida on March 3, 2009. For one game and one game only, Jeter was in the visitors' clubhouse in front of Yankees fans, as he was the shortstop for the United States' 2009 World Baseball Classic squad. It was Jeter's second time representing the Stars and Stripes, and Team USA that year played an exhibition against the Yankees during spring training. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Jeter made sure to note that he got two hits that afternoon. "When I came up, they didn't have all these USA teams. So it was an honor for me. Played with a lot of top players in the game and really enjoyed it," Jeter said of his stint on Team USA. During those times, Jeter shared a dugout with some of his archrivals in Dustin Pedroia, Kevin Youkilis and Jason Varitek of the Boston Red Sox and New York Mets legend David Wright while simultaneously playing against Bernie Williams and Robinson Cano. Even during that USA-Yankees game, he went up against Jorge Posada, despite the two being by one another's side throughout their careers. Derek Jeter plays defense against the New York Yankees in an exhibition game on March 3, 2009. This year, the event figures to be the best one yet, as Team USA is stacked with the two-time reigning American League Most Valuable Player Aaron Judge, and each of the reigning Cy Young Award winners in Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal. Derek Jeter of Team USA celebrates the win with teammates after the 2009 World Baseball Classic Pool C match on March 8, 2009, at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bryce Harper, Cal Raleigh, Mason Miller, Logan Webb, Bobby Witt Jr., Will Smith and Kyle Schwarber also will represent Team USA.

Five-time Team USA Olympic skeleton athlete tells Fox News Digital about her battle to get a spot in the upcoming Winter Games after Team Canada withdrew from a recent competition, affecting her ability to earn points for qualification. At least 12 countries have come out in support of American skeleton athlete Katie Uhlaender. The Olympic committees of Malta, Israel, the Virgin Islands, South Korea, Belgium, Brazil, Jamaica, Denmark, Netherlands, Ghana, Nigeria and Trinidad, sent to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), have signed their support for Uhlaender either in their own letters or signing the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC)'s letter to the IOC advocating for the American to be granted qualification for the Milan Cortina Winter Games. Uhlaender is suddenly leading an international protest to gain qualification after a decision by Team Canada cost her the chance to make her sixth Winter Olympics. Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton (BCS) said the decision to withdraw the athletes was made "after careful evaluation of the program's needs and in consultation with the IBSF" and "careful consideration of athlete health, safety, and long-term development." "It was determined that continuing to race these athletes was not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of the program," it added. "They had come over and explained to us that it would be in the best interest for the way points had worked for Jane, so that we as a team can qualify two spots to the Olympics," Canadian skeleton racer Madeline Parra told The Canadian Press. IBSF's Interim Integrity Unit (IIU) investigated allegations of competition manipulation. It acknowledged the withdrawals raised concern but concluded the governing rules allow teams to withdraw athletes at any time. "This matter relates to the application of the IBSF's rules and procedures in connection with an IBSF organized event. The IOC understands that IBSF has already responded to Ms Uhlaender on this matter," the IOC said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. Uhlaender has the support of at least 12 nations behind her. Vice President JD Vance will lead the U.S. Presidential Delegation to the Milan Cortina Olympics next month. Uhlaender hopes the vice president will advocate for her participation. Katie Uhlaender of Team United States poses for a portrait during the Team USA Beijing 2022 Olympic shoot on Sept. 12, 2021, in Irvine, California. "As U.S. Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to meet with the leadership of the International Olympic Committee, I respectfully ask that he stand with me as an Olympian that has represented the United States of America and our values, the USOPC, and the many affected nations in supporting our request to IOC President Kirsty Coventry to use her authority to uphold fairness in Olympic sport by granting a wildcard entry," Uhlaender said. "Doing so would protect the integrity of competition and prevent further harm. Such action would send a powerful message to young athletes everywhere: that standing up for ethics and integrity may be difficult, but it matters."

Diego Pavia was a Heisman Trophy finalist in his last year with the Vanderbilt Commodores, and he is now looking ahead to a potential NFL career in the next few months. As NFL scouts and media descended on the Senior Bowl this week, Pavia's measurables were recorded. Height is something that doesn't necessarily define a player's career, but it is something teams take into account when making their draft selections. The average height for an NFL quarterback is somewhere between 6-foot-2 and 6-foot-3. Pavia didn't seem to be too concerned with his vitals when he spoke to reporters on Monday. "I feel like the only thing the NFL cares about is can you win, and I view myself as a winner. I've been fortunate with all these great teams that I've had — we've never had a losing season.

(Mark Zaleski/The Tennessean / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) We unite, and then once you unite, you want to play for one another, and once you give 120% effort, there's no one that can stop your team." Heart and hustle are something Pavia showed during his time with Vanderbilt. He had 2,293 passing yards and 20 touchdown passes in 2024 during his first season with Vanderbilt following his transfer from New Mexico State. Vanderbilt was 7-6 and delivered a major win over Alabama.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teresa Hurst waves an upside-down American flag on top of a car during a rally against federal immigration enforcement on Friday, Jan. 23, 2026, in Minneapolis. Prominent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration's characterization of Alex Pretti, the second person killed this month by a federal officer in Minneapolis, as responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon. The death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even as President Donald Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump's coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti's death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans' Second Amendment stances. If the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump's top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter. Demonstrator holds signs during a protest outside the office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Minneapolis, after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by a U.S. Border Patrol officer over the weekend. It came the same day the president dispatched border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota, seemingly elevating him over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who had been in charge in Minneapolis. “I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign,” Noem said. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, an architect of Trump's mass deportation effort, went further on X, declaring Pretti “an assassin.” EDS NOTE: OBSCENITY - People protest against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in downtown Minneapolis, Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026. Within seconds, Pretti was sprayed, too, and taken to the ground by multiple officers. No video disclosed thus far has shown him unholstering his concealed weapon -– which he had a Minnesota permit to carry. As multiple videos went viral online and on television, Vice President JD Vance reposted Miller's assessment, while Trump shared an alleged photo of “the gunman's gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines! The National Rifle Association, which has backed Trump three times, released a statement that began by casting blame on Minnesota Democrats it accused of stoking protests. But the group lashed out after a federal prosecutor in California said on X that, “If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.” That analysis, the NRA said, is “dangerous and wrong.” FBI Director Kash Patel magnified the blowback Sunday on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo.” No one, Patel said, can “bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. “I have attended protest rallies while armed, and no one got injured,” he said on CNN. Federal agents detain a person on Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026, in Minneapolis. Showing up with a weapon is very American,” state Rep. Jeremy Faison, who leads the GOP caucus in Tennessee, said on X. Trump's first-term vice president, Mike Pence, called for “full and transparent investigation of this officer involved shooting.” Republicans were critical in 2020 when Mark and Patricia McCloskey had to pay fines after pointing guns at protesters who marched through their St. Louis neighborhood after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And then there's Kyle Rittenhouse, a counter-protester acquitted after fatally shooting two men and injuring another in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during the post-Floyd protests. “You remember Kyle Rittenhouse and how he was made a hero on the right,” Trey Gowdy, a Republican former congressman and attorney for Trump during one of his first-term impeachments. Meanwhile, Democrats who have criticized open and concealed carry laws for years, Winkler added, are not amplifying that position after Pretti's death. The House Republican campaign chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, is sponsoring the GOP's most significant gun legislation of this congressional term, a proposal to make state concealed-carry permits reciprocal across all states. Asked Monday whether Pretti's death and the Minneapolis protests might affect debate, an aide to Speaker Mike Johnson did not offer any update on the bill's prospects. Trump's vacillating, he said, is “very likely to cost them dearly with the core of a constituency they count on.” Associated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Vindman, who became a key player along with his twin brother in President Donald Trump's first impeachment, announced on Tuesday that he is running for the US Senate as a Democrat in Florida. Vindman, an Army veteran, was serving on the National Security Council in 2019 when the Republican president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, then a Democratic candidate. He and his brother, Eugene, a lawyer on the National Security Council, reported their concerns and sparked investigations. Eugene Vindman now serves as a congressman from Virginia. If Alexander Vindman clinches the Democratic nomination, he'll challenge Republican Sen. Ashley Moody, a former state attorney general who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Marco Rubio as he became secretary of state. Vindman described Trump as a “wannabe tyrant” and federal immigration agents as “thug militias” in his announcement video, which features the recent killing of two US citizens during the deportation campaign in Minnesota. Vindman was forced out of the National Security Council and later retired from the Army after testifying against Trump during impeachment hearings. He said “this president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family but against all of us.” He urged voters to “stand with me now to put a check on Donald Trump and the corrupt politicians who think your tax dollars are their personal piggybank.” Their task in Florida will not be easy. The onetime swing state, which is Trump's legal residence, has swung decidedly red in recent years. Still, Democrats are hopeful that Vindman's fundraising prowess and the national political environment — including the backlash against Trump's immigration crackdown and his lack of focus on the economy — gives them a chance. He later was impeached over the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and again was acquitted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — From her house up high in Colorado's Elk Mountains, author Shelley Read can only look out in amazement at the worldwide success of her debut novel, “Go as a River.” “There were upward of 30 translations already secured before the novel was introduced in the U.S.,” says Read, a fifth-generation Coloradan who lives with her husband in Crested Butte, in a home they built themselves. “And that is when I was like, ‘Oh my goodness.' Published in 2023 by Spiegel & Grau, “Go as a River” received little major review attention beyond trade publications when first released and its honors are mostly regional, including a High Plains Book Award and a Reading the West Book Award. But her novel has been a hit in the U.S. and well beyond, appearing on bestseller lists everywhere from North America to Scandinavia and selling more than 1 million copies. Mazur Kaplan, co-founded by producer Paula Mazur and independent book seller Mitchell Kaplan, is working on a film adaptation. Eliza Hittman, whose credits include the award-winning “Never Rarely Sometimes Only,” is expected to direct. Read's 300-page novel spans from the 1940s to the 1970s, and centers on a 17-year-old Colorado farm girl's ill-fated romance with an itinerant Indigenous man and how it haunts and changes lives for decades to come. “Go as a River” proves that some books can break through without high-profile endorsements or author name recognition. “Every now and then someone comes along who has a vision that they've held for many, many years and they really do write it down. She is a longtime educator who parsed and absorbed so many books, with works by Virginia Woolf and Czeslaw Milosz among her favorites, that one of her own inevitably came out on the other end. For nearly three decades, she taught writing and literature among other subjects at Western Colorado University. During that time, a character kept turning up in her thoughts, the germ of what became her novel's protagonist, Victoria Nash. There was something about Victoria, an empathetic quality, Read related to. But she had her career and two young children, and “was just trying to keep my head above water as a super busy mom and with a lot of very intense challenges.” With Victoria unwilling to leave her be, Read began jotting down notes on Post-its, napkins and other papers that might be around. “I had no idea where it was going. I had no intentions about where it was going, because I had never written a novel before,” Read says, speaking via Zoom from her home. Read stepped down in 2018 and by the following year had finished a manuscript, drawn in part from such historical events as a 1960s flood in Iola, Colorado, and from her lifelong affinity for the local landscape. First-time authors of any age struggle to find representation, but during a 2017 writers conference at Western Colorado University, Read had met Sandra Bond, a Denver-based agent. Read's manuscript “knocked my socks off,” Bond remembers, but it wasn't an easy sell. “Go as a River” was turned down by 21 publishers before Spiegel signed it up. Spiegel & Grau, which began as a Penguin Random House imprint and reopened in 2020 as an independent a year after PRH shut it down amid a corporate reorganization, has worked with authors ranging from Ta-Nehisi Coates and Sara Gruen to Iain Pears and Kathryn Stockett. “I had a feeling Cindy might be able to see how to guide Shelley in revising the second half — what was really working and what wasn't and why,” Bond says. Spiegel and Read worked on revisions — the finished version is entirely from Victoria's perspective; the original draft shifted narrators midway. It was mid-July, and she remembers tracking down publishers in Norway and Finland and other parts of Scandinavia at a time of year when book executives usually are on vacation. Read is working on a second novel, set in southeastern Colorado, where her homesteader-grandparents lived. Meanwhile, royalties from “Go as a River” allowed her a few indulgences, from installing solar panels on her house to a little travel, not to mention paying off college tuition for her son and building up the family retirement savings.</p>

Can't we just say no to Trump for once?” “At the Olympics, ICE's Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations.” McLaughlin stressed that “all security operations remain under Italian authority.” When the Washington Examiner asked whether ICE's investigative component has provided security during past Olympics, DHS did not provide a direct response. Reports indicate several federal agencies, including ICE's HSI, have supported security at previous Olympics and other major international events. It's not uncommon for a DHS agency to do so, considering HSI operates extensively around the world. Vice President JD Vance, second lady Usha Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are set to attend the sporting event's opening ceremony on Feb. 6. There is no indication that President Donald Trump will be in attendance. Meanwhile, ICE has been met with widespread opposition to its immigration actions in Minneapolis from residents and state politicians. Their deaths have motivated anti-ICE protesters to continue resisting federal law enforcement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff's hopes of winning this year's Australian Open came crashing down in just 59 minutes on Tuesday, as she was beaten in straight sets in the quarterfinals by Ukrainian star Elina Svitolina. The American had been playing so well in Melbourne that many tipped her to win her first Australian Open and third grand slam overall, but she struggled to find any of that previous form against Svitolina in sweltering conditions. The Ukrainian, who has also been on a hot streak this year, capitalized on Gauff's poor performance to win 6-1, 6-2 in less than an hour and booked her place in the semifinal against world No. Clearly frustrated by her level during the quarterfinal, Gauff was filmed smashing her racket against a concrete ramp after making her way off the court at Rod Laver Arena. “I tried to go somewhere where I thought there wasn't a camera because I don't necessarily like breaking rackets,” Gauff told reporters after the match. Coco Gauff replaces coach with biomechanics specialist ahead of US Open “I tried to go somewhere where they wouldn't broadcast it, but obviously, they did. So, yeah, maybe some conversations can be had because I feel like at this tournament the only private place we have is the locker room.” A lot of Gauff's frustration likely stemmed from her poor serving performance in the first set, where the world No. 3 produced five double faults that saw her broken in four service games. While her serving improved in the second set, the 21-year-old still made 12 unforced errors, which saw any hopes of a comeback extinguished. “There was just a lot that didn't go well today. I credit it to her because she forced me to play like that. It's not like I just woke up and, yeah, today was a bad day, but bad days are often caused by your opponent. Gauff said she doesn't necessarily regret smashing her racket behind the scenes, knowing the importance of letting off steam after such a frustrating day at the office. She would much prefer to do that, she said, rather than take it out on her coaching team in the player's box. “I don't want to lash out on my team. “I just took the minute to go and do that. I don't think it's a bad thing. Like I said, I don't try to do it on court in front of kids and things like that, but I do know I need to let out that emotion. “Otherwise, I'm just going to be snappy with the people around me, and I don't want to do that because, like I said, they don't deserve it. Just need to let the frustration out.”</p>

Alexander Vindman testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Nov. 19, 2019, during a public impeachment hearing of President Donald Trump's efforts to tie U.S. aid for Ukraine to investigations of his political opponents. Alex Vindman, who became a key player along with his twin brother in President Donald Trump's first impeachment, announced on Tuesday that he is running for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in Florida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi's demand that Minnesota hand over sensitive voter registration records to the federal government amid tensions over ICE and immigration enforcement underscores the importance of the administration's nationwide data grab that is facing resistance in multiple states and has stumbled in the courts. The Justice Department has already sued Minnesota and 23 other states for the voter data, but Bondi on Saturday urged Gov. Tim Walz to help “bring an end to the chaos,” by turning over the records, among other requests. The administration has said it wants the full registration records so that they can “help” states “clean” their rolls of ineligible voters. Voter advocates, former DOJ attorneys and at least one federal judge are dubious that's the administration's only goal with the data collection. “Is the executive trying to achieve a goal through force that it cannot achieve through the courts?” district Judge Kate Menendez asked the Justice Department directly during a hearing Monday. Simon told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday that it was “deeply disturbing” to receive Bondi's letter. “Literally hours after the second, let's not forget second, killing of an American citizen in the city of Minneapolis by ICE agents … there's this term sheet,” he said, “this ransom note.” Adrian Fontes, the Democratic secretary of state in Arizona, compared Bondi's letter to “organized crime”. Bondi's letter did not explicitly promise a change in President Donald Trump's immigration approach in exchange for the voter records, instead pointing to a need to “bring back law and order” to Minneapolis. In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson argued that the Justice Department has “full authority” to ensure states comply with federal election laws. “President Trump is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” she said. The department, in its unprecedented data-gathering campaign, has requested states produce their full voter rolls, which can include non-public information like voters' Social Security and driver's license numbers, full birth dates and current addresses. But even the Justice Department's stated plan of conducting its own review of the rolls is raising legal questions amid concerns that eligible voters may be purged. The department says it's entitled to registration records under the 1960 Civil Rights Act but no court yet has agreed with that argument, and two courts have rejected it outright. A federal judge in California threw out the department's voter-roll lawsuit against that state earlier this month, with a scathing opinion that warned against “unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the Executive without action from Congress and public debate.” A judge in Oregon also has decided to dismiss the case, finding DOJ's legal arguments lacking, he confirmed in a hearing Monday. Amid those court losses, Bondi pressing the dispute in her letter to Walz “appears to be desperation,” said David Becker, a former DOJ attorney who now leads Center for Election Innovation & Research. In most of the lawsuits, DOJ has targeted Democratic state officials, but that doesn't mean that Republican-led states have been eager to hand over their voter rolls. The Trump administration first sent state officials letters requesting the sensitive voter information in the summer, but so far, just 14 states have either fully complied or are working on complying with the requests, according to comments a department lawyer made in court. States that go along with the department's demands are opening themselves to lawsuits as well. Voter advocates have sued Nebraska to prevent the state from handing over voters' personal information to the DOJ. The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, has warned 10 states about potential legal problems in a plan – surfaced in proposed agreements the department offered states –  to hand over their voter rolls for extra scrutiny by the federal government. Such a process could run afoul of a federal law that puts guardrails on how and when states can remove voters, the DNC said, pointing to steps the law requires before purging voters who are believed to have moved. Last year, a division of the Department of Homeland Security dramatically revamped a tool called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement or SAVE, which has been used for years to verify the immigration and citizenship status of people seeking government benefits. In deep-red Texas, for instance, state election officials last year identified 2,724 potential noncitizens on the rolls after running its full list of more than 18 million voters through the SAVE system. But in Travis County, home to Austin, a more thorough search of the state's own data showed that 11 of 97 county voters initially flagged by the Secretary of State's office as potential noncitizens already had provided proof of citizenship when they registered to vote through the state driver's license division, according to Celia Israel, who oversees the county's voter registration program. CNN's Marshall Cohen and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now 81, Ilana Kantorowicz Shalem is one of the youngest Holocaust survivors. Now, more than eight decades after the end of the Holocaust, Shalem is starting to share her story, realizing how few Holocaust survivors are left to bear witness. (AP Video by Ami Bentov and Shlomo Mor) TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — In the last months of World War II, Lola Kantorowicz tried her best to hide her pregnancy. She succeeded because most of the prisoners at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp had bellies that were distended and bloated from extended starvation. As she went into labor in March 1945, the Russians were advancing through Germany, and Bergen-Belsen was in chaos. Now 81, Ilana Kantorowicz Shalem is among the youngest Holocaust survivors. Otherwise, she most certainly would have been killed. More than eight decades after the end of the Holocaust, Shalem is sharing her story — and her mother's story — for the first time, realizing how few Holocaust survivors are left. Commemorations this year are taking place amid a rise of antisemitism that gained traction during the two-year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Lola Rosenblum was from the town, while Hersz (Zvi) Abraham Kantorowicz was moved to the ghetto from Lodz, Poland. After spending several years in the ghetto under hard labor conditions, including losing family members, they were shuffled through several labor camps, where they were able to continue meeting clandestinely for several months. “My mother said there was actually a lot of love in those places,” Shalem recalled of the labor camps. “They used to walk along the river. Her mother's friends used to help set up secret meetings between the two, who had married in an informal ceremony back in the ghetto. Hersz Kantorowicz would eventually perish in a death march just days before the war ended. Lola spent time in Auschwitz and the Hindenburg labor camp. She completed a death march to Bergen-Belsen in Germany while pregnant. Yad Vashem archivist Sima Velkovich, who has researched Shalem's story, called it “unimaginable” that a baby was born in such conditions. “There were thousands, dozens of thousands of people who were ill, almost without food at that time.” To this day, Shalem doesn't have an explanation for how her mother not only survived the conditions of the camp but gave birth to a healthy baby. Mother and daughter spent a month in the Bergen-Belsen camp before it was liberated by the British, and then two years in a nearby camp for displaced persons. Shalem's mother held out hope for years that her father had survived. She never married again, nor had additional children. “Actually, I was everyone's child, because for them, it was some kind of sign of life,” Shalem said. “Many, many women took care of me there, because they were very excited to be with a little baby.” She's not aware of any other children born in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp who survived. Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum and research center, has documented over 2,000 babies born at the Bergen-Belsen refugee camp after its liberation, between 1945 and 1950. The museum at Bergen-Belsen was able to locate documentation of Ilana's birth, including the hour she was born, which is now kept at Yad Vashem. Shalem, who studied social work, started asking her mother questions while she was in university in the 1960s, when it was still taboo in Israeli society to dig into the experiences of survivors. “These people didn't want to talk about it.” She noted how, in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, many survivors of that attack immediately began to speak about what happened to them. Many survivors were trying to forget what had happened. Ilana's mother often faced disbelief when she shared her story of giving birth in a concentration camp, so she mostly stopped telling it. Sometimes her mother would talk about what she endured with other survivor friends, but rarely with strangers, Shalem said. Shalem has never publicly shared the story of her mother, who died in 1991 at the age of 71. Last year, she completed a genealogy course at Yad Vashem and began to understand how few Holocaust survivors are left to share their stories. According to the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference, there are approximately 196,600 living Holocaust survivors, half of whom live in Israel. Shalem, who has two daughters, remembers sharing her own pregnancies with her mother, and marveling at what she had endured. “It's a situation that was very unusual, it probably required special strength to be able to believe,” Shalem said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leavitt says the killing by a federal immigration officer of Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti “occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders.” She also put distance between Trump and ‘assassin' rhetoric on Pretti. U.S. Secretary of Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Alex Pretti had “reacted violently” to attempts to disarm him during Saturday's protests. Bystander footage from the scene tells a different story. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said in a social media post that he had been in contact with the White House after the shooting.

President Donald Trump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated. Saturday's fatal shooting of Pretti, an ICU nurse, by Border Patrol agents ignited political backlash and raised fresh questions about how the operation was being run. Bovino's leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.

Homan will take charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Minnesota. Frey said he planned to meet Homan on Tuesday. Tim Walz spoke in a phone call and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they have exchanged in the past. “We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president wrote in a social media post. Walz, in a statement, said the call was “productive” and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for “any and all” criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honors federal requests for people in its custody. She said the case was a priority, but in an order later Monday, she told the federal government's attorneys to file an additional brief by 6 p.m. Wednesday. She told them to address, among other things, the assertion by the state and cities that the purpose of Operation Metro Surge is to punish them for their sanctuary laws and policies. “If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said. “I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?” Menendez asked. Brantley Mayers, a Justice Department attorney, said the government's goal is to enforce federal law. “That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,” she said. At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her. The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Pretti's shooting added urgency to the case. She ruled then that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals said that ruling was unlikely to hold up on appeal. News of Bovino's departure didn't stop dozens of protestors from gathering outside a hotel where they believed Bovino was staying. They blew whistles, banged pots and one person blasted a trombone. Police watched and kept them away from the hotel entrance. Trump posted Monday on social media that Homan would report directly to him. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan would be “the main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis” during continued operations by federal immigration officers. In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers. The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota. In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, took under advisement a request from the Justice Department to lift an order he issued late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday's shooting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court on Monday blocked a lower-court judge's restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics in Minnesota, handing the Trump administration a significant win as protests and legal challenges continue to surround federal immigration operations in the Twin Cities. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an indefinite stay of a Jan. 16 order by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez that sharply limited how federal officers could respond to protests tied to ICE activity in Minneapolis. Attorney General Pam Bondi lauded the decision, saying lower court judges like Menendez “tried to handcuff our federal law enforcement officers, restrict their actions, and put their safety at risk when responding to violent agitators.” NOW, the 8th Circuit has fully agreed that this reckless attempt to undermine law enforcement cannot stand,” Bondi said. That order by Menendez, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, had barred federal officers from arresting, detaining, pepper-spraying, or retaliating against individuals engaged in what she described as peaceful and unobstructive protest activity. It also restricted officers from stopping vehicles unless they had reasonable suspicion that occupants were forcibly interfering with immigration enforcement. The appeals court previously intervened on Wednesday without issuing a written decision. The court said the injunction effectively amounted to a universal injunction by extending relief to a sweeping, uncertified class of protesters and observers. Citing recent Supreme Court precedent, the panel said federal courts lack authority to impose such broad restrictions on executive branch operations. The ruling comes amid sustained protests in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal agents. An ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good on Jan. 7, and a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen, on Saturday during separate enforcement operations, according to authorities. Both incidents fueled demonstrations and intensified scrutiny of Operation Metro Surge, a large-scale federal immigration enforcement effort in the Twin Cities. President Donald Trump has escalated the federal response, placing roughly 1,500 U.S. troops on standby to assist federal agents and warning that he could invoke the Insurrection Act if unrest continues. Tim Walz (D-MN) spoke and were on a “similar wavelength” with one another. They sought classwide relief on behalf of anyone who observes, records, or protests ICE activity in Minnesota. Menendez said in her Jan. 16 order that protesters showed an “ongoing, persistent pattern” of intimidating conduct by ICE officers. She cited extensive media coverage of aggressive federal responses to protests across the Twin Cities. Although her injunction is now on pause, Menendez is still weighing a separate request from Minnesota officials to halt the broader deployment of federal immigration officers in the state. At a hearing Monday, she said she was wrestling with the scope of the request but acknowledged that federal officials have “a lot of power” to enforce immigration laws.</p>
