                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Democratic leaders on Tuesday threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem if President Donald Trump does not fire her first. Noem has faced increased pressure in recent days for her comments in the wake of the shooting of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen killed by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday. Kristi Noem should be fired immediately, or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives," the Democrats said in a statement. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," they said. In the aftermath of Pretti's killing, Noem claimed he had been "brandishing" a weapon and that he had responded "violently" to officers' attempts to disarm him, claims that were later contradicted by video analysis and analyses from multiple news outlets. Trump on Tuesday said "no" when a reporter at the White House asked him if Noem would leave her post. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Lululemon company spokesperson said: "Over the past several months and as part of our ongoing strategic efforts to strengthen our business, we have been assessing ways to optimize and better support this experience for our guests and employees in North America. "After careful consideration, we have made the decision to transition our North America GEC to a full-time employee staffing model. As a result, approximately 100 part-time positions in our GEC have been impacted," they said. The company has come under pressure in recent months. Its sales in the Americas have slid, and analysts say the brand has veered from its yoga roots and become more generic. Its stock price has sunk 53% in the past year. It previously cut around 150 corporate staff last summer. Wilson weighed in again last week, when the brand briefly halted online sales of its "Get Low" leggings after customers complained they were see-through. Lululemon's current CEO, Calvin McDonald, will step down at the end of this month. His permanent replacement has yet to be announced. Do you work for Lululemon and have a tip or story to share?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok has agreed to settle with a plaintiff and will no longer be part of a high-profile social media trial kicking off on Tuesday. An attorney for the plaintiff said the trial, held in Los Angeles Superior Court, will proceed as scheduled against Meta and Alphabet's YouTube. "This is a good resolution, and we are pleased with the settlement," Mark Lanier, an attorney representing the plaintiff said in a statement. "Our focus has now turned to the Meta and YouTube for this trial." The trial is the first of multiple major legal cases against social media companies in 2026 that have drawn comparisons to lawsuits brought against 'Big Tobacco' in the 1990s. TikTok is still a defendant in other personal injury cases, attorneys for the plaintiff said. Next week, another major trial commences in Santa Fe, New Mexico, involving Meta. In that case, the New Mexico Attorney General alleges that the Facebook-parent company failed to safeguard its apps, resulting in the exploitation of children by online predators. Later this year, another major social media trial will begin in the Northern District of California involving TikTok, Meta, YouTube and Snap. In this federal case, the social media firms will argue against allegations that the design of the apps led to unhealthy and addictive behaviors in teens and children.Since TikTok's U.S. operations became an independent joint venture in order to satisfy a national security law, it has been hit by a wave of glitches and errors. The company said the stumbles were due to a power outage at one of its data centers. Some users have complained about the hiccups and have also claimed that the app was censoring certain political information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From his small, snow-covered farm outside Toronto, home to cats and a dog, and soon some donkeys, Mark Surman has been laying the groundwork for a fierce battle with the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, located about 2,300 miles away in the San Francisco area. The bespectacled 56-year-old is president of Mozilla, a nonprofit organization best known for its Firefox browser and a pledge to keep the internet open and accessible to all. And it's too big of a challenge for Mozilla to tackle on its own. Surman is building what he's described as "a rebel alliance of sorts," using a phrase that's long been part of Mozilla's lexicon. In practice, Mozilla is focused on deploying its roughly $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support "mission driven" tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, according to a report the organization released Tuesday. It's pursuing investments that promote AI transparency, and can potentially act as a counterforce to companies that are growing at historic rates with limited guardrails. Mozilla's cash pile is dwarfed by OpenAI, which has raised more than $60 billion from investors across the globe, and its rival Anthropic, which has raised more than $30 billion, according to PitchBook. Tech megacaps like Google and Meta are also sparing no expense, shelling out billions of dollars to hire AI researchers and tens of billions a year to build out massive data centers. Mozilla represents a growing swath of the AI industry that's afraid of what OpenAI has become and the power that it now wields. When OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015, its stated goal was to "advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return." But in the decade that followed, OpenAI turned into a commercial entity with astronomical growth rates, transformed largely by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. It's a structure that resembles Mozilla, but the similarities end there. OpenAI has dismissed Musk's efforts as part of a "campaign of harassment," and the case is expected to head to trial in April. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers who disagreed with the company's direction. But, even as it's taken a more pro-safety stance in AI development, Anthropic has been racing alongside AI commercially, commanding a $350 billion valuation. Mozilla's uphill battle is even steeper because of the position of the Trump administration, which is determined to stay ahead of China in the global AI race and has been quick to lash out at companies, states and lawmakers that are perceived as potential threats to that agenda. David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as the administration's AI and crypto czar, accused Anthropic of supporting "woke AI" in October due to its approach on regulation. President Donald Trump in December signed an executive order for a single regulatory framework for AI, establishing a litigation task force to challenge state AI laws, namely those led by Democratic lawmakers. Amodei wrote in the post that Anthropic had increased its revenue run rate from $1 billion to $7 billion in nine months, "and we've managed to do this while deploying AI thoughtfully and responsibly." "The people in it are hungry to look where there's weak spots in the current market and take advantage of them." In 2020, Mozilla published a report titled "Mozilla & the Rebel Alliance," which was dedicated to the organization's alliance of "tens of thousands of people around the globe who believe in Mozilla." Even so, Surman said it took some time to convince his colleagues that the moniker applied to the AI era. That process actually started long before generative AI took off. The following year, Surman said Mozilla's leadership agreed that keeping AI "trustworthy and open" was a fight worth picking. Mozilla Ventures has invested in more than 55 companies to date, including dozens of AI startups, with more deals to come in 2026. Trail, a German startup that offers an AI governance solution for regulated enterprises, raised a pre-seed round in 2024, with participation from Mozilla. Anna Spitznagel, who co-founded the company the prior year, said Trail and Mozilla are exploring ways to collaborate more closely, like by building an open-source framework. Mozilla has supported open-source technology since its origin in 1998. But Spitznagel isn't completely sold on Surman's rebel alliance concept. She said it's a "fun analogy" and wants to be aligned with the movement to enable trustworthy AI, but also wants in on the broader AI transformation. "Rebel is a word that for me, personally, it has the wrong association," Spitznagel said in an interview. "I do think about [AI] a bit differently, but I also want to be part of the revolution that actually enables us to deploy AI and not hinder it." Tony Salomone and Ali Asaria, co-founders of Mozilla portfolio company Transformer Lab, said they're similarly on the fence. "I'm not going to lie, I sometimes talk that way to get people kind of excited or engaged in our way of thinking," Salomone said. Founded in 2024, Transformer Lab is building open-source tools that developers can use to build, train and evaluate advanced AI models. The company has yet to publicly disclose any funding and, as of November, had fewer than 10 employees, mostly based in Canada. Asaria said rebel alliance isn't a term he's used, but that there is an ecosystem of smaller AI companies that keep in touch and regularly cross paths at conferences and other events. "There's definitely a group of folks who are interested in this idea of trying to be sustainable companies that can have an impact on the industry and have an appreciation for AI, but don't want to see just a few big companies win," Asaria said. When it comes to the big companies in AI, Surman cautioned that a "winner-takes-all" mentality still lurks behind their open-source efforts. He said their contributions to open-source communities are welcome, but that those same companies will "eat you if you're not careful." It's an issue that resonates with Oumi CEO Manos Koukoumidis. Backed by Mozilla, Oumi operates an open-source platform that researchers and engineers can use to train, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy AI models. Koukoumidis previously spent around a decade working in AI at Microsoft, Facebook and most recently Google, where he became disillusioned with the future he was building. "Even the couple thousand people that are at OpenAI, Anthropic or anywhere else, because they're operating in a silo, they're not enough to advance this technology sufficiently, safely, cost efficiently, sustainably," Koukoumidis said in an interview. "When you enter into the space of AI as a new startup, it's scary, because these few companies control so much more than just the intellectual property," Asaria said. They control funding and access to infrastructure, making it "very hard to just walk into the space without starting with $100 million or a billion dollars," he said. Surman acknowledges he has to play the long game. By 2028, he wants Mozilla to be funding a growing open-source AI ecosystem that's on its way to becoming "mainstream" for developers. And he's determined to prove that Mozilla's approach is economically viable. Mozilla is targeting a series of financial metrics over the next few years, including 20% annual growth in nonsearch revenue, according to a November report. "For many people, the idea that open-source AI can win, or this rebel alliance, that those players can actually take a piece of the market, they find it hard to believe," Surman said. "But there's a bunch of trends that are underway."

In a move perhaps unsurprising to anyone familiar with trademarks, the viral Clawdbot AI agent has a new, equally lobster-y name. The popular AI agent, which debuted in December, was originally named after the monster users see while reloading Claude Code. Then Anthropic came knocking, sparking a new name: Moltbot. "'Molt' fits perfectly - it's what lobsters do to grow." On his own X feed, creator Peter Steinberger was more direct: "I was forced to rename the account by Anthropic. Moltbot's mission will remain the same: a free, open-source agent that does everything from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. You might wondering, why not simply remove the "d" and make it Clawbot? After all, it would fit the branding. Clawd, the official logo of Claude Code, was created in June 2024. The logo and Claude name are both trademarked by Anthropic. Crypto traders are especially peeved by the name change, as there is an unrelated "Clawd" meme coin. Steinberger posted a message shortly after announcing the renaming, asking crypto fans to stop "pinging" and "harassing" him. "You are actively damaging the project," he wrote. Steinberger's personal GitHub account was briefly taken over by "crypto scammers," he wrote on X, though Moltbot's account was unaffected. In one post that Steinberger reposted, an engineer tagged Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. OpenAI scrubbed the news of its deal with Jonny Ive from its site in June, after the AI hardware startup iyO filed a dispute (Ive's startup was called "io").</p>

Amazon is closing the supermarket chain that it spent nearly six years building from scratch. The tech and retail giant said it plans to close its Amazon Fresh stores "to prioritize investment in growth areas," in a company blog post on Tuesday. Amazon has around 60 Fresh stores in the US listed on its website. The company is also shuttering about 15 Amazon Go convenience stores, it said. "While we've seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven't yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion," Amazon said in the post. Some of the locations are set to become Whole Foods stores, Amazon said. Despite creating Amazon Fresh, buying Whole Foods, and building its grocery delivery muscle, Amazon's market share is still a fraction of several rivals. The company has plans to build a Walmart Supercenter-like megastore near Chicago, for example. Amazon has spent the better part of a decade trying to build a grocery store model using its own name that meets its expectations. Amazon said Tuesday that Whole Foods and delivery will be the focus of its grocery business in 2026. Amazon is also opening five new Whole Foods Market Daily Shop stores in 2026, offering a pared-down selection of groceries in smaller stores. Amazon is also working on expanding its grocery delivery capabilities this year, it said. The company offers delivery in 5,000 cities and towns in the US, including many where customers can get same-day delivery on perishable goods like fresh produce and ice cream.</p>

Being patriotic means you also need to call out "overreach" when you see it, Sam Altman privately told OpenAI employees in a message that said Immigration and Customs Enforcement had gone "too far." OpenAI employees responded positively to Altman's message on Slack, including heart and thank-you emojis. Altman's message, which was first reported by The New York Times' Dealbook newsletter, comes as CEO and tech leaders face internal and external pressures in the wake of ICE's deadly shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday. Pretti is the second person to be fatally shot by federal law enforcement amid a surge in immigration enforcement in and around Minneapolis. "I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations." As a general principle, Altman wrote that OpenAI tries to "stick to our convictions and not get blown around by changing fashions too much." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to associate Trump with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House advisor Stephen Miller's initial statements that Pretti was trying to commit domestic terrorism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon said Tuesday it plans to sunset its Fresh and Go brick-and-mortar chains, marking a major pivot in the company's grocery strategy. "After a careful evaluation of the business and how we can best serve customers, we've made the difficult decision to close our Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores, converting various locations into Whole Foods Market stores," the company wrote in a blog post. Amazon said the closures are part of an effort to prioritize investments, though it hasn't given up on physical retail. The company still plans to roll out other brick-and-mortar concepts, including "a mass physical store format." It will continue to operate its Fresh grocery service and invest in same-day delivery of groceries, the company said. It will also expand its line of Whole Foods Daily Shops, which are mini-markets that offer a smaller assortment of grocery items. Last month, Amazon received approval from local officials in a Chicago suburb to construct a big-box store that would offer groceries, household essentials and general merchandise. Amazon declined to share how many Fresh and Go workers will be impacted by the store closures. It said it's working to help employees find roles in its operations network, and that they will be eligible for a severance package. For almost two decades, Amazon has been determined to become a bigger player in the grocery market. Amazon debuted its Fresh grocery chain in 2020, with an eye toward mass-market shoppers. The rollout was turbulent in its early days, with Amazon opening a flurry of locations, before it shuttered some stores and halted expansion of the chain as part of broader cost-cutting efforts. The company launched a revamped Fresh store concept in 2023, and then continued to tweak its strategy. Amazon shuttered all of its U.K. Fresh stores last September, and closed a handful of locations in Southern California soon after. Amazon's Go convenience marts, which debuted in 2018, were a pet project of founder Jeff Bezos. The stores were designed to alleviate the headache of standing in a checkout line by allowing shoppers to "Just Walk Out." Locations were outfitted with an array of cameras and sensors that tracked each item shoppers picked off the shelf and automatically charged them as they exited the store. In recent years, Amazon has sought to sell the software to other companies, primarily sports stadiums, concert venues, hospitals and colleges. It's also tested the automated grab-and-go technology in its warehouses. Last January, Amazon tapped Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel to oversee its worldwide grocery business. The company also began testing a "store within a store" concept at some Whole Foods locations where customers can order a wider array of Amazon products that aren't typically offered at the upscale grocer from an automated warehouse affixed to the store.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A top federal judge in Minnesota ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to personally appear at a hearing in Minneapolis on Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court after his agency repeatedly violated judicial orders related to immigration enforcement actions. The three-page order issued late Monday to ICE acting Director Todd Lyons by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz was scathing, accusing federal immigration authorities of failing to comply with "dozens of court orders" in recent weeks, including one issued by the judge mandating a bond hearing for a detained immigrant. "This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result," Schiltz wrote in the order. "This Court's patience is at an end," Schiltz wrote. The judge said that the Department of Homeland Security and Lyons' agency, which is a division of DHS, "have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders," and that they would take steps to honor those orders. "Unfortunately, though, the violations continue," Schiltz wrote. "Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court," Schiltz wrote. CNBC has requested comment from ICE on the order. The judge called his order "an extraordinary step." "But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed," Schiltz wrote. The order comes as Minnesota state officials press for ICE and other federal immigration authorities to cease aggressive actions rounding up undocumented people in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state. Schiltz's order also came two days after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse on a Minneapolis street, and weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed mom of three Renee Good in her car. The judge's order does not relate to either shooting but to his previous order that DHS and ICE grant a detained immigrant a bond hearing by last Wednesday. That man remains detained despite Schiltz's directive, according to a court filing by the man's lawyer. "This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks," Schiltz wrote Monday. "The practical consequence of respondents' failure to comply has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong): The detention of an alien is extended, or an alien who should remain in Minnesota is flown to Texas, or an alien who has been flown to Texas is released there and told to figure out a way to get home," the judge wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United Parcel Service on Tuesday announced that it was planning to eliminate an additional 30,000 jobs this year as part of winding down its partnership with Amazon and a multiyear turnaround plan. CFO Brian Dykes said on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company's quarterly earnings release that UPS plans to reduce total operational hours by approximately 25 million associated with the Amazon decline. "This will be accomplished through attrition, and we expect to offer a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers." UPS also said it has identified 24 buildings for closure in the first half of 2026, with additional closures possible later in the year. Last year, UPS closed 93 buildings, it reiterated Tuesday. The planned job cuts come after UPS eliminated 48,000 jobs last year, 34,000 of which were operational and 14,000 of which were management. The company had previously estimated those combined reductions to total around 20,000. In a Tuesday statement, representative for the Teamsters said its union workers "still know [their] worth" if UPS brings back its buyout program. "We're perfectly happy for UPS to realize growth and cost savings on the backs of corporate managers so long as they uphold their contractual commitments to our members and reward the Teamsters who actually make the company run," the statement read. UPS is in the midst of a turnaround plan under CEO Carol Tomé, aiming to reinvigorate the business. Though Amazon was previously UPS' largest customer, the two companies are in the process of gliding down operations together. UPS said Tuesday it expects a total of $3 billion in savings related to the Amazon unwind. UPS reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, beating Wall Street estimates and citing encouraging process in its turnaround efforts. Shares of the company were up 4% in morning trading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When I lived in the US, Saturday mornings spent standing in long lines to find deals on prepackaged, processed junk were the norm. As an American, the way I shopped for groceries always made me feel like I was stockpiling for a global emergency. My cart would be filled with things like massive bags of frozen vegetable mixes that tasted like freezer burn, fruits that hadn't been in season in months yet were somehow in stock, and several packages of cookies that felt like too good a deal to pass up. This time, I got my food in open-air markets that let me interact directly with the farmers who grew it. There, I'd choose from fresh piles of in-season produce, like bright-red, juicy tomatoes, and fragrant greens bundled in bunches and tied with dried raffia. I'd pass entire sections of the market where whole cows were being butchered in plain view, a sign of just how fresh the meat being sold really was. This certainly beat walking through warehouses stocked with massive aisles of bulk canned and vacuum-sealed goods. And as I bopped around the world over the next seven years to places like Cambodia, Myanmar, Rwanda, Turkey, and others, I found that my culinary experiences were very similar. Living overseas introduced me to markets where everything felt alive and fresh — and it was the start of me changing my relationship with food for the better. At 40 years of age, I was about 100 pounds overweight, dealing with crippling anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and fibroids that made my belly look pregnant. I'd tried many diets in an effort to lose weight: raw food, keto, fasting, low-carb, cabbage soup, etc. I was seduced by the sweet scent of ripe melons and guava long before I turned a corner and saw them piled high like an ancestor altar. Just like at home, I stocked up on everything that caught my eye. I didn't realize that because the food was so fresh, it tended to go bad quickly. So, I had to develop a new shopping rhythm. Other items like grains, nuts and seeds, and dried spices could be bought in small bulk quantities to last me throughout the month. Abroad, my money seemed to go further and get me more than just cheap processed products. It was exciting to fill my bag with the kinds of fresh, high-quality ingredients that felt out of my budget and harder to access back in the US. After I moved overseas, my meals became simpler and easier to prepare. I learned to rely on simple meals like one-pot soups, stir-fries, and salads loaded with produce in every color of the rainbow. Along the way, I began making my own salad dressings and sauces from scratch, cutting out much of the excess salt and sugar I used to overlook in ingredient lists for premade options in the States. This diet shift, combined with a more active lifestyle — daily walking and running along the beaches and hillsides near where I lived — led to effortless weight loss. Over the past seven years of living abroad, I've lost about 100 pounds. I grew up expecting to run out of money for food and other basic necessities, and that mindset followed me into adulthood. Living abroad helped me build a healthier relationship with food that's rooted in seasonality and respect for nature. By honoring my body with fresh food, I have more energy to move in ways that feel good — not in pursuit of thinness, but because I've learned that my body thrives on movement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. Fundrise, a Washington, D.C.-based online investment platform that prides itself on opening up investment in private real estate companies, real estate assets and private technology companies to the average individual, is now setting its sights on artificial intelligence. It gives users instant access to high-level market intelligence, ranging from neighborhood income and migration trends to multifamily comps and average rents — right down to each individual property. Fundrise's co-founder and CEO, Ben Miller, says it goes far beyond what more generalized AI, like ChatGPT, can offer. The tool is launching with residential data, but Miller said he expects to expand to other commercial real estate sectors within six months. "We went out and built a database of, now, 3.5 trillion data points of all the real estate knowledge you want. RealAI is free to users for the first dozen uses and then charges a monthly rate of $69 for a standard plan. Fundrise culls its data from both public records and private databases. It also includes information on the people living and working in the properties, like their education level, credit scores and income. It gets some of that from social media. By using these extremely comprehensive, proprietary real estate datasets, it can compare markets, evaluate any property and model returns. Miller ran a simulation for Property Play to demonstrate how it works. "You'll be able to actually know what is the best property to buy based on all the factors you give it," Miller said. "This is the type of stuff that I've talked to some of the big asset managers [about] — Blackstone, [TPG Angelo Gordon], some of them have dedicated machine learning teams. The real estate industry has always been notoriously slow to modernize, but major players are starting to tout the game-changing impact of AI. JLL has several AI platforms for property analysis and portfolio management in multiple real estate sectors, but those tools are only available to its employees and clients. In a recent Property Play podcast, Barry Sternlicht, chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said AI would change the world faster than the industrial revolution. "I think we have to let people go, right? Miller said he has been on a mission to democratize investing since starting Fundrise in 2012. It started as a crowdfunding platform for real estate but quickly evolved into a fund structure, the first non-traded public venture fund. CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. Fundrise now has $3 billion in assets under management in funds for both commercial real estate and technology, and, according to Miller, over 2 million investors. By using technology to pool capital and offer low minimum investments, Fundrise has opened up access to asset classes that were traditionally limited to wealthy individuals and institutions. Its tech venture fund includes investments in private companies like OpenAI, Databricks and Anthropic. Miller, whose father was a major real estate developer in the D.C. area, says he has always wanted to be a "traitor to my class." We've been leveraging technology year after year, doing new things that hopefully change the way things are done," he said. Miller admits that AI will cause job losses in all sectors of commercial real estate. "This is what technology has been doing so far in America the last 20 years. It makes the rich richer, and it has a negative impact on the normal worker," Miller said. I think that would be a bad outcome for society."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pinterest said Tuesday it plans to lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as the company embraces artificial intelligence. In a securities filing, Pinterest said it expects the cuts will be complete by the end of its third quarter in late September. The social media company said it's "reallocating resources" to AI-focused teams and prioritizing "AI-powered products and capabilities." The company said it expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of about $35 million to $45 million. Pinterest had more than 4,500 employees globally as of last April, according to its most recent proxy filing. The company last October released a "Pinterest Assistant" shopping tool. At the same time, Pinterest has rolled out more automated advertising tools for marketers as it faces increasing competition from TikTok, Meta's Facebook and Instagram. "Our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off," Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in November. "We've become a leader in visual search and have effectively turned our platform into an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million customers." Pinterest isn't the only company downsizing as it invests in AI. AI was cited as the reason for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. last year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Some experts have questioned whether the technology is the real source of the job reductions, saying some companies could be "AI-washing," or blaming layoffs on the new technology to cover up cost-cutting efforts or other issues with their businesses.

The deadly shootings by ICE agents in Minnesota are driving some CEOs to publicly wade into politics again. It's a break from a corporate retreat fueled by fears of irking President Donald Trump, investors, consumers and others.Their remarks in recent days range from expressions of grave concern and grief to blunt criticism. More than 60 heads of large companies based in the Minneapolis area, including UnitedHealth, 3M, and General Mills, called for "deescalation of tensions" in an open letter that didn't mention Trump, ICE, or the shooting victims, Alex Pretti and Renee Good, by name. Target's incoming CEO, who starts next week, sent a video message to staff in which he described the violence and loss of life in the local community as "incredibly painful;" he did not mention Trump or ICE directly. Big names in tech and venture capital, as well as small business owners around the country, have expressed outrage at the Trump administration and ICE on their own social media pages, using words like "murderer," "shameful," and "a conscious-less administration."

He said that reactions that convey sorrow and don't mention Trump or ICE are likely to be perceived as an unwelcome challenge to the White House's immigration agenda. A White House spokesperson referred Business Insider to press secretary Karoline Leavitt's remarks on X from a briefing on Monday, in which she said "nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets." Some CEOs who voiced dissent in the past have faced blowback. Earlier this month, Trump said he was "inclined" to block ExxonMobil from operating in Venezuela after the company's CEO, Darren Woods, told him the country was not ready for investment. Trump responded by threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies. Robert Pasin, CEO of toy company Radio Flyer, recently shared an email on LinkedIn that he sent to his employees that was critical of the shootings in Minneapolis. The response from staff at Chicago-based Radio Flyer was "overwhelmingly positive," Pasin told Business Insider. During Trump's first term as president, CEOs talked about politics more freely, most notably after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in 2020, and again after the January 6 riots. "You previously had corporations embracing a much more, quote, woke positioning," said Serazio. "It became a competition of who can suck up to him the most," said Serazio. Any public statement from a CEO carries the risk of alienating customers and shareholders. But some see taking a stand as necessary at times like this. "It's also just bad for business when people are afraid to leave their homes." Vogel described being so forthcoming on social media as nerve-racking, "especially in such a charged environment." "It would just be cowardice to not have a perspective on this." What's holding most back, Berman said, is a narrow calculus focused on short-term shareholder pressure and fears of retaliation by Trump. "We know what happens in countries that follow this trajectory."</p>

Business Insider has verified his former employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I've spent half of my 20 years in the tech industry working at Google and Meta. These companies allowed me to work on some amazing projects, but I've now resigned from them both. I didn't feel my position at Google would give me the opportunity to do that, so I opened myself up to other opportunities. When a Meta recruiter reached out about an AI machine learning engineer role, I decided to pursue it and eventually received an offer. I left Google in July 2024 and started at Meta a month later. However, halfway through 2025, I started thinking about resigning to build a startup — specifically, a venture that would use AI to help the typical household with their finances. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Whether to resign from Meta was a complex decision. I know what financial pressure feels like — I had been a low-paid graduate student trying to provide for a newborn. Many people don't have access to great financial planning and management tools to help improve their financial situations. That helped me grow more comfortable with the idea of leaving Meta, but there were still a lot of other factors to consider. It's hard to leave a world-class team with people you like — not to mention a reliable source of income. I know some people start businesses on the side while keeping their full-time jobs, but I couldn't do that because I was already juggling two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent. I would've had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues — especially since my business idea was related to AI, like my role at Meta. I wanted to make sure my family had enough savings to cover at least one year of our current expenses without touching our retirement accounts. My wife works, but I wanted a cushion in case she lost her job. I figured that would give me at least one year to build the business, and, if things went really badly, enough time afterward to find a job. We already were in a good place savings-wise, so we were still able to take vacations, hire tutors for our kids, and order DoorDash. I had about six months before resigning to make some minor adjustments, including cutting back on 401(k) contributions and putting more money into liquid savings accounts. When I shared the news with my colleagues, the response was a mix of surprise, support, and a large amount of jealousy. A lot of people want to leave and start their own thing, but for various reasons they can't or won't — whether it's because of their visa status, financial constraints, or broader fear. I'm now focused on my business, Bear Financial. My cofounder and I are planning to publicly launch in the second half of this year. Second, make sure anyone who depends on you, like your family, is supportive of the decision — I was fortunate to have a supportive partner who knew that I felt limited working in Big Tech. Third, choose an idea you deeply believe in. I'd also suggest envisioning the worst-case outcome and asking yourself whether you'd be OK with it. I thought about what it would look like one year later if my business failed. If I eventually decide to pursue a corporate position again, I have faith that I'd be able to find something — even though it's hard to predict what the job market will look like.</p>

Tesla offered a free trial of its FSD system in December. I was driven autonomously for most of the month and came away with new insights. The latest software was impressive, but my experience revealed a glaring problem that could hamper Tesla's path toward a full, unsupervised Robotaxi service. I also have an up-to-date version of FSD. This combination resulted in an amazing FSD experience. I drove from Silicon Valley to Lake Tahoe in supervised autonomous mode and had no issues. I drove into SF and back several times, trouble-free. I estimate 90% to 95% of my driving was in FSD mode during December. Instead, my eyes are on the road and my hands are ready near the wheel, just in case. Despite the ability to text while being driven now, I pay more attention to the road in FSD mode, not less. less with my wife about directions when we are on FSD-powered trips together. There's no discussion about whether this or that route is better. That's probably worth the entire $100-a-month FSD subscription cost. But I don't drive enough at the moment. That's when cars drive themselves with no human at the wheel. Tesla's Robotaxi service started doing this in Austin recently, but elsewhere, these Robotaxis still have safety drivers behind the wheel. And Tesla is trying to do this with a purely camera-based system, while Waymo uses cameras, Lidar, and other sensors that are not just vision-based. Backers of the multi-sensor approach say their systems are better and safer because components such as Lidar collect data without "seeing," so they work in more environments. However, this is more expensive than camera-only systems. Tesla's approach is cheaper, so that's good for efficiently mass-producing millions of robotaxis, such as the upcoming Cybercab. But, can camera-only systems actually work as well in unsupervised situations? I'm a huge fan of my Tesla vehicle, and I hope both autonomous approaches work and make roads safer. A couple of times, when I was in FSD mode and being driven into the low sun, I got a loud, red warning sign on the screen of my Tesla telling me to take over immediately or the system would pull over. I took the wheel quickly with no further issues and restarted FSD soon after. A week or so later, I got an alert from Tesla to bring my vehicle in for a service. I set up an appointment, which the Tesla app told me would cost $60. I took it to a nearby Tesla location, and the cleaning lasted about an hour. After that, I didn't get any red warning signs for the rest of December while using FSD. This front camera is not easy to clean because it has a housing around it, which might also trap moisture that could otherwise dissipate more easily from the car's interior. If Tesla wants its cars to be fully unsupervised Robotaxis, a front interior camera that fogs up and needs to be professionally cleaned seems like a potentially big problem. With a million Robotaxis on the road, how many times might Tesla service employees have to clean these cameras? There are signs that Tesla may already be responding to this issue, as it gets more experience running its Robotaxi service. In September, Elon Musk wrote on X that keeping the front camera clean is "a major area of focus." That only addressed exterior dirt and moisture, though. More recently, Tesla Robotaxis have been spotted with new cleaning systems that squirt water onto the outside cameras to clean them. More importantly, there's a new setup for the front camera behind the windshield, according to photos posted on X recently by Tesla investor and owner Sawyer Merritt. Another Tesla owner posted a photo this week of a new Model Y with an updated front camera housing. Tesla also has a patent for a new way of preventing front camera glare, for use in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. "The glare shield features a textured surface composed of an array of micro-cones, or cone-shaped formations, which serve to scatter incident light in various directions, thereby reducing glare and improving camera vision," Tesla wrote in the patent filing. It's unclear how well these fixes will work. But Tesla is obviously trying hard to address these challenges. I asked Tesla and Elon Musk all about this on Monday in a detailed email. They didn't respond by publication time on Tuesday morning. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.</p>

Nvidia sales executives recapped conversations with key customers — including Bank of America — following a conference late last year, according to an internal email thread from November viewed by Business Insider. The chip giant has been selling its "AI Factory" — a full setup of chips and software designed to build, train, and run large-scale AI systems — to large businesses. Bank of America told Nvidia it was struggling with deployment, according to the email thread. The exchange reveals that while companies rush to purchase AI infrastructure, operational and regulatory hurdles make deploying it far harder — a key challenge for Nvidia as it expands from selling chips into enterprise software. On the thread, Nvidia executives also discussed how they can better work with customers in using its AI products. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. A second executive later responded that Nvidia "can't just sell" AI Factory hardware but needs to provide a software solution to help business customers succeed. "Buying GPUs or signing a cloud contract is a business decision; deploying AI is an institutional change," she told Business Insider. MLOps refers to machine learning operations, or the processes for implementing AI models in real-world use cases. That executive added that Bank of America did not think Nvidia's AI enterprise software was "ready for their highly regulated banking industry." The executive also pointed to other concerns, including Bank of America's security and governance requirements, such as documentation and support for air gapping — isolating systems from other networks to improve security. Nvidia vice president Ian Buck subsequently jumped into the thread, signalling how senior leaders at the chip giant can step in when customer concerns surface. "Looks like they need help and/or our product is coming up short," Buck wrote. The struggles at Bank of America echo earlier issues with Nvidia's enterprise software efforts, including a need to educate prospective clients on what it is and isn't. While banks have a long history of using AI for tasks like credit decisioning, they may be the first to run into issues because of the scale of their data and customers, said Tom Davenport, an information technology and management professor at Babson College. "The technology's out way ahead of what individual banks or most companies actually can implement quickly," he said.</p>

If your techie friend is texting a lobster, here's why. Clawdbot is an open-source AI agent that works around the clock and can connect to many common consumer apps. After Anthropic reached out over similarities in the name and logo, its creator Peter Steinberger gave the agent a new name: Moltbot.)

In a key distinction from ChatGPT and many other popular AI products, the agent is open source and runs locally on your computer. Users then connect the agent to a messaging app like WhatsApp or Telegram, where they can give it instructions via text. He formed the tool around the question: "Why don't I have an agent that can look over my agents?" "I already did the whole startup thing," Steinberger said. bro came back from retirement> built @clawdbot > solved "AI forgets everything" problem> and still gave it to us for freeabsolute legend 🐐 pic.twitter.com/tPwwicah42 That's led some people to brush off their old laptops. "Installed it experimentally on my old dusty Intel MacBook Pro," one product designer wrote. Others are buying up Mac Minis, Apple's 5"-by-5" computer, to run the AI. Logan Kilpatrick, a product manager for Google DeepMind, posted: "Mac mini ordered." It could give a sales boost to Apple, some X users have pointed out — and online searches for "Mac Mini" jumped in the last 4 days in the US, per Google Trends. But Steinberger said buying a new computer just to run the AI isn't necessary. "Please don't buy a Mac Mini," he wrote. The Mac Mini buy-ups have spawned dozens of memes. One founder wrote that his "meal prep" was a fridge full of Mac Minis and Monster energy drinks. Another founder prophesied a wave of Mac Mini returns in two weeks. getting a mac mini just to run clawd has got be most performative thing you can do to start the year pic.twitter.com/KwTYIEcJqI Many techies are excited by the agent's capabilities. "AGI is here and 99% of people have no clue," he wrote. The AI seems to be at least moderately popular. A16z partner Olivia Moore described the process, from terminal commands to API keys. "For most consumers (or even prosumers), the learning curve is likely too steep," she wrote. You are giving an AI agent almost unlimited access to your digital life and passwords, after all. Rahul Sood, a former Microsoft exec who founded its investment arm, wrote that it turned text messages into "attack surfaces" and had "zero guardrails by design." One hacker described the AI as hiring a "brilliant" butler who later opened your home to the public, allowing a stranger to read your diary. Steinberger responded to these security concerns by outlining some guardrails users could employ, including reading the security document and avoiding adding the AI to group chats. How much should we hand over our digital lives to AI? A16z partner Justine Moore warned against being the "guy who automated his entire life with ClawdBot."</p>
