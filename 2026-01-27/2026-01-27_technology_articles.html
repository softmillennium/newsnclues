                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is heading into its earnings report facing what one analyst calls a “prove it” moment, with investors looking for signs that its massive AI bet is sparking sustained cloud growth. Microsoft has been spending big to keep up in the AI infrastructure race against Amazon, Google, and others. Its capital expenditures hit a record $34.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter alone, up from $24.2 billion in the prior quarter, as it moves quickly to build out data centers. Analysts and investors will be asking whether a slower growth rate reflects temporary capacity constraints or something more concerning. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called this week a “prove it” moment for CEO Satya Nadella and team, noting that “doubters are building” in the stock even as his checks with Microsoft partners remain “incrementally strong” around Copilot and Azure deployments. The transition creates revenue opportunities but has also generated customer friction amid reported update issues. Meanwhile, some analysts say demand has softened in the PC and small-business segments. But when it comes to AI adoption, Microsoft is touting continued signs of traction. Althoff also offered a window into how quickly AI agents are proliferating inside large organizations. Microsoft turned on its new Agent 365 management tool internally before announcing it at its Ignite conference, he said, and discovered 138,000 agents being used by 88,000 employees on a weekly basis. GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent. Microsoft reaches $4 trillion valuation — for a moment, at least — after big earnings report Microsoft beats expectations, reveals Azure revenue for the first time — $75 billion a year Microsoft beats expectations with nearly $25B in quarterly profits, as AI revenue boosts cloud growth Microsoft earnings preview: AI fuels cloud growth, boosts capital costs, reshapes workforce</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta has started blocking its users from sharing links to ICE List, a website that has compiled the names of what it claims are Department of Homeland Security employees, a project the creators say is designed to hold those employees accountable. Dominick Skinner, the creator of ICE List, tells WIRED that links to the website have been shared without issue on Meta's platforms for more than six months. “I think it's no surprise that a company run by a man who sat behind Trump at his inauguration, and donated to the destruction of the White House, has taken a stance that helps ICE agents retain anonymity,” says Skinner. But as well as threatening to prosecute those they claim are “doxing” ICE agents, the Trump administration has pressured tech companies to block any efforts at crowdsourcing the location and activities of those agents. Skinner says it is run by a core team of five people, including him, as well as hundreds of anonymous volunteers who share information about ICE agents operating in cities across the US. The site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but a WIRED analysis found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn. WIRED also confirmed that links can still be sent on WhatsApp, another Meta-owned product. When WIRED attempted to post a link to the site, we received a message that read: “Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can't be edited.” Hours later, however, that message was updated to read: “Your content couldn't be shared, because this link goes against our Community Standards.” The message linked to Meta's Community Standards homepage rather than a specific part of those rules. Let us know if you think we made a mistake.” In response, Skinner pointed out that ICE List has been asking for tips about the identities of ICE agents for six months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It hasn't even been a full week since TikTok's U.S. operations came under new management, and the app is already under fire with users claiming mass censorship. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Monday night that he is launching a review into whether TikTok is violating state law by allegedly “censoring Trump-critical content.” Newsom made the announcement in a post on X, resharing a user's claim that when they tried to send a direct message containing the name “Epstein,” it failed to go through because it may have violated TikTok's community guidelines. “Following TikTok's sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports — and independently confirmed instances — of suppressed content critical of President Trump,” Newsom's press office also posted on X. “Gavin Newsom is launching a review of this conduct and is calling on the California Department of Justice to determine whether it violates California law.” The governor's press office was referring to news announced last Thursday of a new joint venture that now oversees TikTok's U.S. business, led by three managing investors who each hold a 15% stake. Those managing investors include Oracle, the tech giant founded by Trump ally Larry Ellison, as well as private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi–based MGX. “We don't have rules against sharing the name ‘Epstein' in direct messages and are investigating why some users are experiencing issues,” a TikTok U.S. spokesperson told NPR. “We're continuing to resolve a major infrastructure issue triggered by a power outage at one of our U.S. data center partner sites,” the statement read. “While the network has been recovered, the outage caused a cascading system failure that we've been working to resolve together with our data center partner.” The statement went on to list issues users may experience, including slower load times and creators temporarily seeing zero views or likes on their videos. Other users reported having trouble uploading videos related to ICE protests, while still others said they noticed a sudden drop in political content on the app more broadly. TikTok also experienced wider technical issues over the weekend, with Downdetector reporting more than 500,000 user reports between Sunday and Monday. On Monday, CNBC reported that the number of U.S. users who were deleting the app had increased by 150 percent, according to Sensor Tower data. In its announcement, the joint venture said its mandate was to “secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures,” adding that the algorithm would be retrained on U.S. user data and secured on Oracle servers. At a forum in May 2024, then-Sen. Mitt Romney linked broad bipartisan support for banning TikTok unless it cut ties with China to concerns among lawmakers about pro-Palestinian content on the app. Newsom wasn't the only politician to call out TikTok more recently Sen. Bernie Sanders said, in his post on Monday, that Ellison now controls the TikTok algorithm alongside media properties owned by Paramount, including CBS, MTV, and Nickelodeon. Thousands of American TikTok users have reported having issues with the app this past weekend. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted laws aimed at creating their own reserves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Employees at Google DeepMind have asked the company's leadership for plans and policies to keep them “physically safe” from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while on the company's premises, according to screenshots of internal messages obtained by WIRED. On Monday morning, two days after federal agents shot and killed Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti, a Google DeepMind employee sent the following message in an internal message board for the company's roughly 3,000-person AI unit: It continues: “What kinds of plans and policies are in place to ensure our safety at the office? As we have seen, government agency tactics can change and escalate quite rapidly. With offices in many metro areas across the US, are we prepared?” The message received more than 20 “plus emoji” reactions from Google DeepMind staffers. By Monday evening, no senior leaders from Google had responded to the message. While Silicon Valley CEOs have largely bent the knee to Trump, their employees have started raising concerns internally and externally about the federal government's actions. Employees of AI labs that partner with Palantir—including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Meta—have also discussed whether to push leaders to cut ties with the defense tech firm, The New York Times reported. Concerns about ICE agents entering Google's offices are not unfounded. They noted that an “officer arrived at reception without notice” and that the agent was “not granted entry because they did not have a warrant and promptly left.” Late last year, Google and Apple advised employees on visas not to leave the country after the White House toughened its vetting of visa applicants. At that time, Silicon Valley leaders were not shy about defending visa programs, which have allowed the United States to bring in top talent from around the globe. But AI executives have appeared hesitant to speak out about the federal government's latest immigration actions. Beyond Google, top executives from Silicon Valley firms—including OpenAI, Meta, xAI, Apple, and Amazon—have yet to publicly comment on ICE activities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed the Minnesota incident in an internal message to the company, according to DealBook, telling employees that “what's happening with ICE is going too far.” “I'm horrified and sad to see what has happened in Minnesota,” said Anthropic cofounder and president Daniela Amodei in a post on LinkedIn on Monday. Update 1/27/26 at 1pm EST: This story has been updated with Google's decline to comment. In your inbox: Maxwell Zeff's dispatch from the heart of AI</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least, that seems to be Nintendo's latest missive, as it's set to bring back its worst-selling console from the grave as a Switch 2 accessory. What's more, Nintendo's $100 Virtual Boy recreation may be the best way to experience the eye strain-inducing early rendition of 3D gaming thanks to several exclusive features and games that went unreleased until now. If you weren't already aware, Nintendo's faux-3D console from 1995 is once again offering players the chance to hunch down into a pair of goggles built into a kickstand. Instead of using the 30-year-old device's novel single LED strip and rotating mirrors, it instead asks you to slot in the Switch 2 to act as its stereoscopic screens. There are some oldies but goodies you've probably never had the chance to play before. Nintendo is bringing back several games like Galactic Pinball, Golf, and 3D Tetris that were only ever available on the Virtual Boy. There are more oddities in store, such as Teleroboxer, a kind of Mike Tyson's Punch Out! style game, but instead of smacking up Glass Joe, you're beating up a robot (this seems to be a trend in robotics nowadays). There are also the unknown classics like Red Alarm and Wario Land. The latter game uses the stereoscopic 3D effect in interesting ways, allowing players to jump back and forth from foreground and background platforming sections. The big benefit of this device is that Nintendo plans to release several “unreleased” titles, including Zero Racers and D-Hopper. These titles were notoriously previewed in early video games magazines and shown off at trade shows but never saw the light of day, mostly because the Virtual Boy crashed and burned. Nintendo says there will be more exclusive features, including the ability to change the screen color from red to yellow, green, and white. I've played emulations of Virtual Boy in VR, and the experience is far more engrossing than many players realize today. Sure, goggles built on a kickstand are a recipe for eye and neck strain, and the novelty may wear off quickly for some. For others, it's a mode to see the untapped potential of 3D displays. Everyone's favorite dino buddy is joining the cast of 'Super Mario Galaxy,' and he looks adooooorable. The retro Game Boy maker's first pro-level controller may still be enticing even to non-hypochondriacs. AMD's new Ryzen 7 9850X3D seems powerful, though it's not a massive leap over what we already have. Nintendo's Wonder Flower toy joins Alarmo to annoy everybody in the bedroom.</p>

RAM pricing seems to be hitting a plateau after several months of constant hikes. We see this in the pricing data compiled by PC-building platform PCPartPicker.com, with the cost of some DDR4 and DDR5 modules finally hitting a stable value. Beyond these trends, specific examples include the Corsair Vengeance 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 on Amazon, which stabilized at $339 between November and January (from a low just over $100), before making another hike to $439 in early January and staying there until today. There's also the Patriot Viper Elite 5 16GB DDR5-6000 CL30 on Newegg, which was priced at $169.99 since early December 2025, although it only cost $43.99 in October 2025. We also saw this Corsair 32GB Vengeance kit go on sale for a brief period, bringing its price down to $344 from a high of $410. This is why a Kingston rep told users that they shouldn't wait if they need to upgrade their RAM or SSD, as prices will only continue to go up. For now, chip prices seem to be stabilizing, albeit at a new, inflated price that will be difficult for enthusiasts to stomach. One Sapphire employee predicted in December 2025 that we will eventually hit this plateau in six to eight months — hopefully, the price equilibrium we're seeing at the moment is the early arrival of this forecast and isn't just a pause before they start racing up again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Help desk automation is a billion-dollar industry, and one of the most likely to be disrupted by tech built upon AI. Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and SurgePoint Capital. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function. “With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP. If that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It's a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces. “One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company said Tuesday morning that it's closing all of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations, a total of 72 stores nationwide, concentrating its efforts instead on its Whole Foods Market locations and grocery delivery from Amazon.com. Despite “encouraging signals,” Amazon said it wasn't able to create “a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion.” California stores will stay open 45 more days due to state labor notification requirements. A limited number of Amazon Fresh stores are expected to eventually reopen as new Whole Foods locations. Amazon did not disclose the total number of employees impacted. With the closures, Whole Foods will become Amazon's only physical store brand in the U.S., a decade after it began its push into brick-and-mortar retail with its first bookstore in Seattle. It's part of a broader reset at Amazon, which is also preparing for another wave of corporate layoffs as soon as this week. “Although we're closing these stores, the impact of your work will shape our next generation of store concepts and customer experiences,” he wrote in the memo, obtained by GeekWire. As part of the changes, Amazon is moving its online grocery fulfillment, logistics and related operations to SVP Udit Madan‘s Worldwide Operations organization. Amazon launched its Fresh grocery delivery service in Seattle in 2007, starting a long push into one of retail's largest and most difficult categories. Grocery margins are thin and competition is fierce, but the prize is massive: Americans spend more than $1 trillion a year on groceries, and winning those purchases means winning a customer's weekly routine. Amazon says Whole Foods sales have increased by more than 40% since it acquired the chain in 2017, now operating in more than 550 locations. That store, Amazon's largest physical retail venture yet, is expected to open in 2027. The “Just Walk Out” technology originally developed for Amazon Go convenience stores, which uses overhead cameras and sensors to avoid traditional checkout, will live on as a licensing business. Amazon says the technology now operates in more than 360 third-party locations across five countries, including hospitals and sports arenas, and in more than 40 of its own fulfillment center breakrooms. Investors who follow Amazon's business closely may not be surprised by the news. On the company's October earnings call, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney asked Jassy directly whether Amazon still needed Fresh stores given the traction in online grocery delivery. Since August, Amazon has expanded same-day delivery of groceries from 1,000 cities to 2,300, integrating items like milk and produce into the same shopping cart as electronics and household goods. “We're on to something very significant with what we're doing with perishables from our same-day facilities,” Jassy said on the October call. A year ago this week, Amazon expanded Buechel's role beyond Whole Foods to oversee its entire worldwide grocery business, including Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh — a move that, in retrospect, may have signaled where the company was headed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The startup is laser-focused on building an AI shopping agent, but also, after a snowstorm barreled through New York City, Phia founders Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni can't leave their respective apartments. So it's a rarity that when I chat with the former Stanford roommates and best friends, they are not together, nor are they in the Phia office. Phia is ten months old, yet it just closed a $35 million funding round led by Notable Capital with participation from Khosla Ventures and returning investor Kleiner Perkins. When I last spoke with Phia in October on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage, they were just one month removed from an $8 million round that included checks from celebrity investors like Kris Jenner, Sara Blakely, and Sheryl Sandberg. “We are just at such a prime time of opportunity,” Gates said to explain the new fundraise. As it stands, Phia is a mobile app and a web browser extension that seeks to help shoppers save money by showing them resale or second-hand alternatives to the products they're looking for. Beyond resale options, Phia might also recommend similar items from less expensive brands, which is where its partnerships come in. “A lot of [brand partners] were very much taking a bet on us and joining the platform when we had less proof points,” said Kianni. When brands make sales on Phia, the app gets a cut, similar to an affiliate marketing model. As Gen Z digital natives, Gates and Kianni have amassed over 2 million followers across social media platforms. This includes their podcast “The Burnouts,” in which the duo talk about their entrepreneurship journey and interview prominent figures in business and entertainment, from Bryan Johnson to Paris Hilton. “Our number one goal was always bringing the top engineering talent specifically into our company, and being able to have capital that can really attract the best people,” Kianni said. The current Phia team, who all work out of the New York office (so long as there's not a massive snowstorm), is about twenty people, which is small for a company with somewhat nebulous ambitions to revolutionize commerce – but as Kianni puts it, “It's not even about team size anymore. “We always are extremely transparent with users about the reasons why we are requesting certain permissions, and everything is displayed very clearly up front,” Kianni said. “In terms of the way that we're building our tech and our back end, we've always made sure all data is aggregated, anonymous, and only used for the purpose of being able to help users find the best products as efficiently as possible.” Hopefully, that incident is remembered as a growing pain for the startup, and not an indicator of problems to come – because Phia is right that online shopping could use a makeover. “I think that's where AI agents play a huge role,” Kianni said.

The DGX Spark is a well-rounded toolkit for local AI thanks to solid performance from its GB10 SoC, a spacious 128GB of RAM, and access to the proven CUDA stack. GB10 SoC is efficient and reasonably fast for AI tasks 128GB of RAM makes it easy to run most local AI models Pricey if you don't need everything it offers The fruits of the AI gold rush thus far have frequently been safeguarded in proprietary frontier models running in massive, remote, interconnected data centers. But as more and more open models with state-of-the-art capabilities are distilled into sizes that can fit into the VRAM of a single GPU, a burgeoning community of local AI enthusiasts has been exploring what's possible outside the walled gardens of Anthropic, OpenAI, and the like. Today's hardware hasn't entirely caught up to the rapid shift in resources that AI trailblazers demand, though. These systems rarely come with more than 32GB of RAM, and their relatively anemic integrated GPUs aren't going to churn through inference at the rates enthusiasts and developers expect. Gaming GPUs bring much more raw compute power to the table, but they still aren't well-suited to running more demanding local models, especially large language models. Even the RTX 5090 "only" has 32GB of memory on board, and it's trivial to exhaust that pool with cutting-edge LLMs. As conversations lengthen and context lengths grow, the pressure on VRAM only increases. The hunger for RAM extends to other common AI development tasks, like fine-tuning an already trained AI model for better performance on domain-specific data or quantizing an existing model to reduce its resource footprint for less powerful systems. Apple paved the way with its M-series SoCs, which in their latest and greatest forms pair as much as 512GB of LPDDR5 and copious memory bandwidth with powerful GPUs. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The centerpiece of the DGX Spark is Nvidia's GB10 SoC, which combines a MediaTek-produced Arm CPU complex joined together with a Blackwell GPU on one package. Both of these chiplets are fabricated on a TSMC 3nm-class node, and they're joined together by Nvidia's coherent, high-bandwidth NVLink C2C interconnect. Those chips share a coherent 128GB pool of LPDDR5X memory that offers a tantalizing canvas for pretty much any common AI workload you can think of. The Spark itself is a pretty straightforward mini PC. The Founders Edition version we're reviewing today has a spiffy gold finish with a metal foam front and back panel for ventilation. Around back, you get a power button, one USB-C power input, three USB-C 20Gbps ports with DisplayPort alt mode support, an HDMI 2.1a port, a 10Gb Ethernet port, and two QSFP ports for the onboard ConnectX 7 NIC running at up to 200 Gbps. That exotic NIC lets you cluster a pair of Sparks together for experimentation with Nvidia's NCCL distributed computing libraries. If the Founders Edition Spark isn't to your liking, Nvidia has made the GB10 platform available to its system partners with a bit of wiggle room for customization. Dell, Acer, Asus, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, and MSI have all created GB10 boxes of their own with small variations in power, cooling, storage, cosmetics, and remote management options. Nvidia makes it easy to integrate the Spark into your existing workflow in a number of ways. The preinstalled DGX OS is a lightly Nvidia-flavored version of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. You can use it as a regular PC with keyboard, mouse, and monitor connected, or you can set it up headless and use the free Nvidia Sync app to SSH into the system from your Windows PC or Mac. Using tools like Tailscale, you can conceivably connect to your Spark from anywhere in the world. For just one example, I was able to leave ComfyUI running on the Spark and created a custom port forwarding rule that let me turn any PC in my house into a generative AI workstation with a single click.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If your gaming machine isn't rendering any frames itself, what's the point of having a costly computer at all? I know some of you out there are mumbling resentments, asking that question already knowing the answer. To add to the grumbling, Intel has finally come off the line with its first edition of Panther Lake CPUs, dubbed Core Ultra Series 3, and a new version of its existing upscaler promising to push gaming on lightweight devices. I've already tested it out on the Asus Zenbook Duo. Along with Panther Lake, Intel is offering players the chance to test multi-frame generation—aka “fake frames”—for themselves without needing an increasingly expensive Nvidia or AMD GPU. Intel's head of Arc graphics, Tom Petersen, previously told Gizmodo he's used it in multiple games, and he doesn't even mind the odd graphical glitches it creates. The more important thing for him, he recently told Digital Foundry, is a general sense of smoothness for gaming—mostly cutting down on CPU timings to eliminate awkward in-game stuttering. Frame generation is one of those software sleight-of-hand tricks that PC gamers have come to loathe. For some players, the barest concept of “fake frames” drives them mad, especially since they're paying thousands of dollars for a gaming-capable PC. Intel's latest XeSS 3 model is one of several AI upscalers that take an image rendered at a lower resolution and then use AI to massage those pixels into something resembling the promised resolution. This enhances frame rates at the cost of some visual fidelity. To the PC purists' chagrin, many modern PC games enable upscalers such as Nvidia's DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and AMD's FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) by default. Every major gaming console from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo all includes some upscaling capabilities. While Nvidia's DLSS 4.5 and AMD's FSR Redstone are both locked to proprietary hardware, Intel's XeSS (Xe Super Sampling) is device agnostic (though AMD's open FSR 3 and 3.5 models remain active on many existing titles). Either way, XeSS multi-frame gen uses AI to inspect the scene to create multiple frames, which are then interpolated in between two fully rendered frames. Multi-frame generation only exacerbates the promise and problems inherent to frame interpolation. These graphics cores based on the Arc B390 microarchitecture are supposed to offer strong performance for tasks like rendering and gaming, all without pushing these laptops' total power package into the stratosphere. While XeSS is hardware agnostic, it does come with certain advantages on an Intel machine. Unfortunately, the software sometimes fails to recognize which games are actually installed. You'll only maintain around 36 fps in benchmarks with the Zenbook Duo's max 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. Once you enable XeSS, the frame rate can jump to closer to 45 fps, more or less depending on if you opt for “performance” or “quality” settings. Cyberpunk 2077 running on an Asus Zenbook Duo with ray tracing “low” settings and max resolution. Once frame generation comes online, that's when I can start to play the game at near 60, near 80, and closer to 90 fps with 2x, 3x, or 4x frame generation, respectively. Frame generation causes two major issues: latency and visual artifacts. The game running at 4x frame gen feels noticeably floatier—though not unplayable. I could notice how when flicking the camera quickly, I would see ghostly flickering of streetlights and screens over the streets of Night City. There were fewer problems with the existing 2x frame gen, in any case. In a game like Hogwarts Legacy, I can net more than 90 fps indoors when the laptop is only rendering less than 30 fps. When running around, I noticed numerous graphical glitches with creeping shadows that climbed up the player character's robes. Here you can see Hogwarts Legacy without and with frame generation. The game runs fairly well even without generated frames. I may as well reduce some graphics settings rather than make excuses for awkward graphical artifacting. So what if we go truly ludicrous and try and play Cyberpunk 2077 with 4x frame gen with ray tracing settings set to ultra? All I can say is that the laptop is doing its best, but there are some obvious and glaring visual artifacting that even the most tolerant player would find hard to excuse. Some players may not care about reducing their resolution to half of what their screen actually supports if it means a playable game. I'm one of those players who cannot stand to look at fuzzy textures and reduced UI detail for the sake of higher frame rates. On a Zenbook Duo, games like Cyberpunk 2077 are indeed playable and visually stunning in scenes. It's the closest we've seen to the single-chip performance of AMD's Strix Halo chips and at a much lower TDP (thermal design power) and without AMD's touted GPU architecture. You'll need to sacrifice something for gaming on a mobile Intel Panther Lake device. For smaller, cheaper devices, upscaling and—yes—even frame generation make much more sense. It's worth a look on a laptop (even one as expensive as the $2,300 Asus Zenbook Duo), though I wouldn't hinge my hopes on it. We may even see Intel-based handheld gaming PCs from companies like Acer and MSI later this year, or so we hope. When gaming on a smaller screen, it's much harder to spot any visual inconsistencies. For now, Intel's fake frames on laptops will still be a mixed bag. Some who buy an expensive laptop with one of Intel's higher-end GPU chips may not care about floatier controls or awkward visuals if they can push their frame rate to near the max of what their display is capable of. Get ready to return to the neck-straining magic of red and black gaming with several never-released games for the Virtual Boy. The retro Game Boy maker's first pro-level controller may still be enticing even to non-hypochondriacs. AMD's new Ryzen 7 9850X3D seems powerful, though it's not a massive leap over what we already have. It's got an incredibly bright OLED screen with performance that will keep you from using it for much else than work. This may be the moment when ARM really takes off on PCs, though it couldn't come at a worse time.</p>

The scx_horoscope scheduler “makes CPU scheduling decisions based on real-time planetary positions, zodiac signs, and astrological principles,” notes its creator, Lucas Zampieri. someone built a Linux CPU scheduler that makes scheduling decisions based on planetary positions and zodiac signsit actually works haha: pic.twitter.com/21rSldWBBKJanuary 26, 2026 It may sound like an exercise in silliness, unless you are a believer, but this GitHub project does a great job demonstrating the power and flexibility of sched_ext. In brief, sched_ext is a relatively new pluggable framework that allows for custom Linux schedulers to be implemented without kernel patching. We are sure the feature wasn't designed to assign CPU time and other system resources based on the movements of heavenly bodies – but it can. Zampieri, who is a software engineer at Red Hat specializing in RISC-V architecture projects, discusses the features and implementation of his scx_horoscope on the afore-linked GitHub repository. The dizzying arrays of mumbo jumbo behind this scheduler almost encourage blind acceptance in its prioritizing decisions. After reading the GitHub, head spinning as I thought about the ever-moving boosts and debuffs of elemental effects, I almost felt hypnotized into believing. It actually draws on resources like accurate geocentric planetary positions, lunar phases, cosmic weather reports, and dynamic time slicing to come up with its scheduling adjustments, too. It definitely isn't recommended for use in production systems - not because of bugs, but because it works as intended… The dev is still looking to add “more cosmic chaos” to scx_horoscope, so contributors are welcome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a perfect June evening in New York when I received my first email from the source who would ask me to call him Red Bull. Now the sun was setting, while I—in typical 21st-century parenting fashion, forgive me—compulsively scrolled through every app on my phone. The message had no subject line and came from an address on the encrypted email service Proton Mail: “vaultwhistle@proton.me.” I opened it. I'm currently working inside a major crypto romance scam operation based in the Golden Triangle,” it began. But I want to help shut this down.” I knew only vaguely that the Golden Triangle was a lawless jungle region in Southeast Asia. But as a reporter who has covered cryptocurrency crime for the past decade and a half, I understood that crypto scamming—specifically the version of it that's come to be known as “pig butchering,” in which victims are lured with promises of romance and lucrative investments, only to be tricked into handing over their life savings—has become the most profitable form of cybercrime in the world, pulling in tens of billions of dollars annually. This sprawling scam industry is, today, staffed by hundreds of thousands of forced laborers in compounds across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. They're trafficked there from the poorest regions of Asia and Africa and pressed into the service of Chinese organized crime groups. The result is a self-­perpetuating, constantly growing, globe-spanning money funnel that destroys lives on both ends—bankrupting one kind of victim, enslaving another. I had read harrowing reports of scam compounds where laborers are beaten, tortured with electric shock batons, starved, and even murdered by their captors. Never before, though, had I heard of someone currently working within a scam compound offering to act as a whistleblower—an actual source on the inside. I had no idea, still, if this purported source was real. (I'd come to learn that the Golden Triangle—once the American nickname for a vast hotbed of opium and heroin production—now mainly refers to a city-size Laotian “special economic zone” bordering Myanmar and Thailand and largely controlled by Chinese business interests.) The two write-ups described every step in the compound's work: creating fake Facebook and Instagram profiles; using hired models and AI deepfake tools to complete the illusion of a real romantic prospect; tricking victims into “investing” in fake trading platforms they recommended. It even detailed the small gong that would be struck in the office when someone pulled off a successful scam. I had barely had time to skim these detailed descriptions—this was not how I'd planned to spend a Saturday evening with my wife—when my phone rang, just after midnight. “You can call me any name, brother, no matter,” the voice said with a shy laugh. I insisted that I'd need a name for him, even if he just wanted to make one up on the spot. “You can call me Red Bull,” he said. Months later, he would tell me that he'd been looking at an empty can of the energy drink as we spoke. Red Bull explained that he'd tried reaching out to US and Indian law enforcement agencies and Interpol, as well as the tip lines for a few news outlets, but no one had responded other than me. He asked me to tell him more about myself—and then cut me off as soon as I'd said two sentences about my work covering crypto crime. “So you are the person I share everything with,” he said hurriedly. “And you will help me to expose this, right?” For the next few minutes, Red Bull warily answered my questions. He didn't tell me his real name but said he was from India—that most of the compound's forced laborers were from India, Pakistan, or Ethiopia. Like most of his coworkers, Red Bull had been tricked by a fake job offer—in his case, to work as an IT manager for an office in Laos. He was forced to sleep in a dormitory room with five other men and work 15 hours at a time on a nocturnal schedule designed to sync with the daytime of the Indian Americans they targeted for scamming. (That system—matching scammers with victims of their own ethnicity to build rapport and avoid language issues—is common, I'd later learn.) Red Bull's situation was not precisely the brutal modern slavery I had read about elsewhere. In theory, the staffers were incentivized with commissions designed to create the illusion that they could get rich from hard work. Red Bull told me he was paid a base salary of 3,500 Chinese yuan a month, close to $500, but the money was almost entirely taken from him by daily fines for various infractions, most often not meeting his quota of initial conversations with victims. He was bound into this system by a one-year contract, and believed when that time was over—in about six more months—he'd be allowed to leave. So far, he told me, he hadn't successfully scammed anyone, only skated by with the minimum number of plausible attempts. A city-sized “special economic zone” just inside Laos, the Golden Triangle is controlled largely by Chinese business interests—often illegal ones. This map shows the office and dormitory where Red Bull was kept. Red Bull told me he'd heard of people who were beaten and electrocuted for breaking rules, a female staffer who he believes was sold into sexual slavery, and other coworkers who mysteriously disappeared. “If they knew I was talking to you or doing something wrong to them, they would directly kill me,” he said. Then Red Bull launched into the immediate purpose of his call: There was a scam in progress he knew about, targeting an Indian American man who had already been scammed at least once, but remained in the thrall of one of Red Bull's colleagues. The pickup was set to happen in three or four days. The victim lived just a few hours away from me. If I acted quickly, Red Bull explained, I could alert law enforcement and help set up a sting operation to capture the courier. Red Bull impatiently said that he'd write me the details on Signal and hung up. Within seconds, he was sending screenshots of the compound's internal chat logs, his colleagues' conversations with victims, and more details on the sting operation he wanted me to arrange. With my mind reeling, I paused for a moment. Then I called Red Bull back on Signal without warning—with video enabled. The view from the hotel room where Red Bull first spoke to WIRED, as seen over a Signal video call. He gave me a half smile, seemingly unconcerned about revealing his face. I didn't know much about the Golden Triangle, but this appeared to be it. Finally, Red Bull showed me his work ID, with a Chinese name the compound had given him: Machao. At 4 am, I was still lying awake in bed, considering what to do with the eager new source who seemed determined to put his life in my hands. Toward the end of 2024, West became so fed up with the US government's failure to do anything about the pig butchering epidemic that she'd retired early from her position as a deputy district attorney and was now focused full-time on running her own anti-scam organization, called Operation Shamrock. I asked West for advice about who in law enforcement could help arrange the sting that Red Bull had requested. “Here's someone on the inside who's willing to share this information and tell us everything about how this whole operation runs.” But she quickly shot down the idea of a sting. Nor did she think that arresting a lowly money mule would be the major win that Red Bull believed it to be. More important, a sting—or any effort to warn the victim myself by asking Red Bull for his contact and reaching out—could also create suspicion of a leak inside the scam compound that might be traced to Red Bull and put his life in jeopardy. I had been talking to Red Bull for less than 24 hours. Already I was making the decision to stand by as a potential six-figure scam took place, as a cost of protecting him. Beyond this question of a sting, West told me, she wasn't sure that handing Red Bull over to the FBI was the right approach. And the result of whatever he shared with the feds would likely fall far short of his expectations: criminal charges, in absentia, for low-level bosses at best. “If he thinks that the FBI and Interpol are going to march into Laos and take this place down, that's never going to happen. Far more valuable than building a case against this single operation, she argued, would be to use whatever Red Bull could share to tell the larger story: the high-­resolution reality of pig butchering compounds, their operational details, the scale of their work. Some of this had been described before by survivors of the compounds, but never, to West's knowledge, by an insider source leaking documents and evidence in real time. The role of human trafficking in scam compounds' operations has only become harder to measure, West told me, with the Trump administration's destruction of USAID, which funded humanitarian organizations in the region. “The story here is how we allowed these criminals to embed themselves in Southeast Asia like a festering cancer,” West said. “And how it's disrupting our ability to trust people.” I told Red Bull that we couldn't arrange a sting operation without risking his life. Red Bull and I soon settled into a routine of speaking on Signal every morning New York time, around 10 pm in Laos, as he walked around outside his dormitory in the half hour after he woke up and before he went into the cafeteria for a meal. (This “dinner” preceded his approximately 15-hour workday, which included two breaks to eat.) He spent much of our first conversations pitching a series of increasingly high-risk evidence-gathering methods: He wanted to wear a hidden camera or microphone. He suggested setting up remote desktop software so I could see in real time everything on his screen. He offered to install spyware on the computer of his team leader, another Indian worker with aviator glasses and a short beard who went by the name “Amani.” He even proposed to hack into the laptop of Amani's supervisor, 50k, a short Chinese man with a paunch, tight pants, and a tattoo on his chest that Red Bull could never quite make out. Maybe that spyware would help us gather intel on 50k's communications with his own boss, “Alang,” whom Red Bull never saw in person. For every one of these brazen ideas, I consulted with colleagues and experts who told me, one after another, how hidden-camera evidence-gathering required training, how the software Red Bull wanted to install on the office computers left behind detectable artifacts—why, in other words, all these ideas were likely to get him caught and killed. We settled on a far simpler approach: He would use Signal on his work computer to send me messages and materials throughout his work hours, using Signal's disappearing messages feature set to a five-minute countdown timer to cover his tracks. It was Red Bull's idea to change the name and icon of the Signal app on his computer to make it look like a desktop shortcut for its hard drive. Pages and pages of chat logs, posted to the office WhatsApp group, documented the scamming wins of Red Bull's colleagues and the tragic responses from victims: “Always had a dream of having a girlfriend then wife like you” … “U stopped talking to me” … “I will continue praying for your Mom” … “Please help me withdraw my money OK?” … “????? ?” … “😭” One video showed a victim crying in his car after losing a six-figure sum; the mark had sent the clip to his scammer to elicit guilt, perhaps, but it was instead being passed around the office for laughs. Every member of the team was required to post daily updates—how many “first chats” they'd started, how many “deep chats” they'd had, the kind that might lead to successful scams. Their group chat used euphemisms like “opening a new customer,” for hooking a new mark, and “recharges,” for repeat victims. If they met it, they'd be rewarded with weekends off, the freedom to have snacks in the office, even parties at a nearby club. A whiteboard in the office tracked scam successes, listed alongside workers' pseudonyms and team names. Every worker also posted a mandatory daily schedule—not of their own nocturnal life sitting at a desk in a fluorescent-lit office and sending Facebook and Instagram messages, but the schedule of the rich, single woman they were pretending to be: 7 am “peaceful yoga and meditation,” 9:30 am “self-care and vacation planning,” 2:30 pm “dentist visit,” 6 pm “dinner and talking with mother.” Sometimes during our voice calls, Red Bull would tell me to enable video and record my screen. Then he would walk into the cafeteria and surreptitiously film his surroundings while pretending to talk to his “uncle.” I got a tour through the bright lights of the building's lobby and stairwells, the lines of depressed-­looking South Asian and African men lining up for food. Once he even showed me the inside of the office, a large, beige room where I could see clusters of desks with red, yellow, and green flags on them that connoted each team's scamming performance. After a few days, Red Bull and I tried upgrading our cover story, and I became a secret girlfriend he was texting with—a better explanation for his use of Signal should it be detected. We peppered our conversation with heart emojis, referred to each other as “dear,” and signed off with “miss you,” until our chat logs started to look almost like the fraud romances his team carried on daily. But we soon found the pretense too embarrassing and gave it up. On another occasion, as I was heading to sleep, Red Bull wrote a surprisingly sensitive farewell message: “Good night! Then, during our call the following morning, Red Bull began explaining to me the role that AI chat tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek play in the compound's work: how they're trained to use them to clean up their language, find just the right sentiment, never run out of inviting turns of phrase. His goodnight message the previous evening, he told me without hesitation, had been copied directly from ChatGPT. Funny, I thought, how easy it is to be taken in by a bit of sympathetic text sent by a new acquaintance on the other side of the world. In the few minutes I had with Red Bull every day between the dormitory and the office, amid our other conversations about his safety and evidence-­gathering tactics, I asked how he'd come to be trapped in the compound and why he had become so singularly motivated to expose it. His father was a schoolteacher but also sometimes worked as a construction laborer and, along with Red Bull's mother, raised dairy cattle and sold ghee—clarified butter—to survive. Muslim men in the region had sometimes been conscripted to fight or carry supplies for Pakistani-backed forces, then branded as terrorists and killed by India's military. When the conflict died down, Red Bull's parents sent him to live with his grandparents in the city of Rajouri, a four-hour bus ride away, where they hoped their unusually bright and inquisitive child could get a better education. His grandparents were harsh guardians, he told me. They forced him to chop wood and fetch water when he wasn't studying, and his school was a 6-mile walk away. “I kept thinking: If not today then tomorrow things will get better,” he wrote to me. When he was 15, Red Bull's grand­parents sent him to live with the family of a pair of his teachers, who made him work as a servant in exchange for paying his school fees. This became the beginning of his computer fixation. After a particularly humiliating scolding, Red Bull decided to run away. For a time he went door-to-door selling Ayurvedic medicines. In 2021, he was accepted into the computer science program at Kashmir Government Polytechnic College in Srinagar, the region's biggest city. At the university, he slept in a room without proper bedding through the freezing Kashmiri winters, and often went hungry. A friend taught him how to make Facebook pages for businesses, or buy and sell them like a real estate developer flipping properties. Working on the school's PCs, he soon made the equivalent of $200, enough to buy his own used Dell laptop—a prized, life-­changing possession. After three years of studying, working, and sending money home to his family, he graduated with a diploma in computer engineering—the first time, he says, that anyone from his village had ever attained that level of technical education. He'd also developed a stubborn, even angry determination to chart his own path through the world. “My mom and dad always advised me to have patience and to stay strong, and their advice gave me some inner strength, but the fight itself I always carried alone,” he wrote. “It is very hard for anyone to truly understand me, but I never stopped fighting my circumstances.” Robot had long been one of his favorites.) A friend from college told him of someone in Laos who seemed to be able to find people good work. Red Bull began talking to that thirdhand contact, called Ajaz, who said he knew an agent who could get him hired as an office IT manager making around $1,700 a month. For Red Bull, that alluring salary would mean he might only have to work for a single year before returning to school. He boarded the plane without even knowing what industry his employer might be in—only that he would help manage its computers. The next morning in Bangkok, he called the agent, an East African man who summarily told him to take a 12-hour bus ride to Chiang Mai, and then a taxi to the border with Laos. When Red Bull arrived there, he was to take a selfie showing that he was outside the immigration office, and text it to the agent. A few minutes after Red Bull did as instructed, an immigration official came outside, flashed the selfie he'd evidently received from the agent, and demanded 500 Thai baht—about $15. Red Bull paid, the official stamped his passport, and he was sent down to a boat waiting on the Mekong River below. He took Red Bull's passport without explanation and gave it to immigration officials along with some Chinese currency. Then he left, taking Red Bull's passport with him. An hour later, the agent arrived and drove him in a white van to a hotel in northern Laos, where he would spend the night. The next morning, he was brought to an office, a gray tower of concrete surrounded by other drab buildings amid the lush green mountains of northern Laos. They told him he'd passed, and they began asking him about his familiarity with social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. No, they said, for once speaking without euphemism: He would be a “scammer.” As the reality of his situation finally became clear, Red Bull spiraled into panic. The Chinese boss told him he'd be starting immediately. Only then did he see the dimensions of the trap that had sprung around him: Too late, he read about the thousands of Indians deceived and ensnared just as he had been, with no passport or means of escape. In the midst of this sickening epiphany, his parents video-called him to ask if he'd gotten the IT manager job. The colored flags in each team's work area indicate whether it's been meeting scam revenue quotas. Over the next days, with little in the way of orientation, he was pulled into the machinery of the scamming organization he'd come to know as the Boshang compound: He was trained to create fake profiles, given scam scripts, and then set to work on a nocturnal schedule, manually spamming out hundreds of introductory messages every night to lure new victims. It struck him that he knew more about computers than most of his coworkers, or even his bosses, who seemed to understand only how to use social media, AI tools, and crypto­currency. Within days, he began daydreaming of using his technical skills to quietly gather information on the compound and, somehow, expose it. Team leaders took employees' personal phones and put them in a box when they began their shifts, and they were strictly prohibited from taking work devices out of the office. But otherwise, the surveillance of staffers and their own phones seemed surprisingly loose. “They tell themselves survival is the only goal, and they shut down anything that feels human,” Red Bull wrote to me. “Empathy, guilt, even memories of who they were before.” I can gather evidence, names, scripts, patterns, connections.” If there isn't, then at least I'll know I stayed human in a place that tries to turn people into monsters.” One day, Red Bull told me, his team leader Amani asked him with menacing calm why he was spending so much time outside—referring, most likely, to the walks when Red Bull would talk to me on Signal—and generating so few new “clients.” Maybe, Amani suggested, a beating or some electric shocks would increase his productivity. I told him he should immediately stop communicating with me from the office—it was now far too risky. My editors came to a more severe conclusion: I should shut down my reporting with Red Bull altogether until he was free. The documents displayed the anatomy of scamming at a level of resolution I'd never seen before: lists of conversation starters; tutorials on what to do when a target asks for a video call and how to delay until a deepfake model is ready to speak with them; tips on how to complain about overcautious financial institutions so victims don't get spooked by their own bank's warnings. Following my editors' lead, I told Red Bull that it was time to stop. “OK, done,” he said, with his usual quick pivot. Red Bull says the food tasted of strange chemicals. Now, I told him, he should focus on completing the remaining six months of his contract as safely as possible, and we'd talk again when he was free. But Red Bull, once again, was already several thoughts ahead. If he didn't go back, he'd tell his supervisor, it would cause serious trouble for him, his family, and ultimately the compound. He would plead to take a two-week trip home, deal with the situation, and return. Maybe, he said, his bosses would buy this story and let him leave. But after all the risky schemes I had already talked Red Bull out of, he seemed more stubbornly intent on this one. I was in touch, for instance, with a Southeast Asian activist who asked to be identified only as “W,” who had experience helping political refugees escape from the region. Red Bull suddenly switched into cover story mode as he entered the office lobby. “Things will be better soon, OK?” Then he ended the call. At another point in those daily conversations, Red Bull brought up another potential path to freedom: If only he could pay the equivalent of $3,400, he could buy out his contract and go home. He just needed to get the money somehow. Then the realization that, of course, WIRED couldn't possibly give money to a source in this way, much less reward an organized crime group for human trafficking. The idea violated journalistic ethics—payments to sources are generally considered a corrupting conflict of interest—and would set an unforgivable precedent. Even so, the mere mention of that payment option also planted in my mind a different, darker thought that I now couldn't shake: What if Red Bull was scamming me? I had set aside my initial skepticism of Red Bull once I'd seen enough proof that he was who he said he was: a real person trapped in a grim compound in Laos. Now, almost two weeks into our relationship, the troubling possibility nagged at me: What if he truly was a scam compound insider, but this had been the scam all along? I decided to compartmentalize my suspicions, keeping the possibility of an ulterior motive in my mind next to the more likely probability that his intentions were genuine. A couple of days later, meanwhile, he mentioned his forged document idea again, and I again suggested he wait for help from someone like W and not risk the scheme. But with every day, I could tell that he was increasingly set on his plan. Just a few days later, on a Saturday afternoon, I was surprised to get an email from the same Proton Mail account that Red Bull had first reached out from but hadn't used since we'd switched to Signal. Just like that first email, it had no subject line. I opened the message and my mind instantly went blank with dread. Now, it seemed, the worst possible outcome had come to pass. I suppressed panic as my mind spun through options. I texted my editors and W, in the hopes they might have some idea of how to help. Fifteen minutes after that first email came another, more coherent message from Red Bull: “I'm trapped. “If there's anything you can do, please help me.” In the meantime, W responded to me on Signal. I didn't know how Red Bull was emailing me, but W cautioned that it would be dangerous to respond. It still seemed they didn't know he was talking to a journalist and leaking their secrets. “There's no way he'd get out of this area alive.” He advised that I wait to hear more from Red Bull about his situation and how to safely communicate. Twenty-four excruciating hours passed before I received another email from Red Bull—a long, stream-of-­consciousness block of frantic text. “Last night those people beat me I am still hungry I have not eaten anything they disconnected my card my personal phone and everything today they will decide what to do with me the Indian team leader and everyone sat in front of me and said do you know who we are and they beat me again and then made me sit back in the office today I have to accept that whatever I did was fake and I have to accept my mistake I cannot run away from here I have no money and I cannot even go outside the gate I am contacting you from the system PC if you have any way then send me an email I will check it and tell W to talk to me on my email and those people are telling me to give them 20k yuan they said if I give it they will leave me without doing anything more please tell W to reply to my email whenever they torture me and bring me back to the office I am only on the system PC have a nice evening ahead” He wrote quickly, this time with the short version: He'd been put in a room and told again to find someone to pay 20,000 yuan for his release, the equivalent of around $2,800. In the midst of this life-or-death crisis, I couldn't help but think that this might just as easily be the endgame of the scam I'd suspected in the back of my mind: Hook a journalist's attention, lure him in, give him responsibility for a source's safety, and now require a payment to save his life. Regardless, my editors had made clear to me that neither WIRED nor I could pay Red Bull or his captors. They were, in fact, warier than ever that he might be scamming me. W was far more experienced in these situations—and if Red Bull were monitored, he'd at least be caught speaking to an activist rather than a reporter. Over the next few days, I spoke with one person after another who I hoped might be able to help Red Bull, perhaps even by paying his ransom: Erin West, W, W's boss at the nonprofit he worked for. One by one, each of them backed away—either from concerns about rewarding a scam compound's human trafficking, suspicion that Red Bull's story might itself be a scam, or some combination of the two. West, despite her enormous enthusiasm when Red Bull first came forward, now said it sounded like a human trafficking racket she'd heard of elsewhere, in which fake victims solicit fake ransoms. W got as far as speaking to Red Bull on multiple Signal voice calls but was overwhelmed by his panicked energy and thought his desperate pleas for the ransom payment—and promises to pay W back in the future—were dubious. But I still felt I owed it to Red Bull to take his situation at face value and—assuming it was all true—do whatever I could within the bounds of journalistic ethics to get him out. Three days had passed since he was first held ransom. It was becoming clearer that he was no longer being closely monitored, perhaps because his captors were growing bored with him. “Things are not going good,” he told me with typical understatement, speaking softly, close to the phone's microphone. On one occasion the bosses put a white powder into a cup of water and told him to drink it. He found that it made him unnaturally talkative and confident but then gave him a rash of raised red bumps on his skin. He was sometimes sent back to his dormitory to sleep, he told me, but hadn't eaten in days and was deprived of water for long stretches. He'd written to various Indian embassies and consulates across Southeast Asia, but none had responded. I don't know why,” he said a few minutes into our call, his voice finally breaking into a muffled sob, the first time I'd ever heard him express self-pity. Then he quickly controlled himself with a single breath. Four days after he'd first been caught trying to escape and held for ransom, Red Bull texted me to say that something had changed in the compound. Everything was strangely quiet, and no one had summoned him to the office. When he asked some of his coworkers, they told him there were rumors the Laotian police were planning a raid. Their Chinese bosses had gotten a tip from someone on the inside and were laying low. “Please share your passport copy, company ID,” it read. The embassy stopped responding to Red Bull's messages. Late one night, I managed to get an Indian embassy official on the phone after several tries. He seemed confused about which person we were talking about, then repeated the government's vague assurance that it would rescue him, and hung up. One day I woke up to a series of messages offering up a confession, as if he feared he might die in the room where he was being held and wanted to absolve himself of sin. That is why I want to tell the full truth now.” He later told me more details of those two victims. I tried contacting them but couldn't find one, and the other never responded. For the larger of those two sums, Red Bull should have received a commission based on the scam compound's incentive structure. I had entirely missed this, though he'd made no attempt to hide it. “I am trusting you with my real story,” Red Bull concluded his confession. After 10 days in limbo, Red Bull told me that he and his coworkers had been ordered to pack their things. The entire staff was moving to a new building a few hundred feet away, and the workers were told they'd have to continue their work from these temporary dorm rooms rather than the office. According to the rumors, a raid was finally coming. Throughout this time, Red Bull was treated more or less like a dog, as he described it, a pariah set apart from the other workers: He had no bedding; sometimes he slept on the floor and was fed only when someone remembered to give him food, often spoiled leftovers. Yet somehow, even then, Red Bull was still motivated to keep digging. During this hiatus from the office, work devices were now allowed into the dormitory—a loosening of security that Red Bull realized could offer him an opportunity. He used that access to make screen recordings, meticulously scrolling through months of the compound's internal conversations, as well as all the screenshots of chat logs with victims his colleagues had posted. Another day, he found his own work phone left unattended in a different dorm room—he hadn't had access to it since he was first caught trying to escape—and repeated the WhatsApp linking trick so that he could access that device's messages, too, from his personal phone. Then he made another screen recording of scrolling through its chats. Red Bull sent me samples of these recordings, but the full videos ran to nearly 10 gigabytes, far more than he could text me from his phone's data plan. A raid by Laotian police targeted the building that housed the Boshang compound offices, but Red Bull's bosses had already moved their operation on a tip. So the raid appeared to round up forced laborers in other offices. A week later, after he and his coworkers had moved to the new building, Red Bull sent me a very different, more dramatic series of short clips: One showed dozens of South Asian men standing outside of a high-rise building, being lined up by what appeared to be Laotian police in khaki and black uniforms. Now these videos were circulating among workers who had only narrowly missed the crackdown. As the rest of the compound's operations struggled to adapt to their new makeshift workspace, Red Bull, of course, had already been stuck in purgatory for weeks. He was dead weight, taking up space when they were already crowded into their temporary building. Then he wrote to an Indian acquaintance who had a position in a scam compound nearby, telling him that he needed to go home to see his family but would soon return. Soon he had several hundred more dollars in his account. Later, when Red Bull had finally escaped, he would marvel at this last slight, as if it were somehow worse than all the slaps, kicks, drugging, and starvation he'd endured. “I never expected this from them,” he wrote to me, punctuating his text with crying emojis. “They didn't even allow me to wear my shoes.” These files would turn out to be the most significant and unique material he provided me. A team of reporters at WIRED would later convert them into a 4,200-page PDF of screenshots and share them with scam compound experts. Ultimately, no one had given Red Bull the help he needed to escape—not the human rights groups I tried to connect him with, not the Indian government (which never rescued him as promised), and not WIRED. Now, despite that complete lack of incentive or aid, amid the most desperate circumstances, he had obtained and given me the biggest data prize yet. Red Bull, back in his home country of India. Now there could finally be no doubt: Red Bull was real. On a quiet backstreet of a city somewhere in India, I wait alone—surrounded by several dozen macaque monkeys lounging, grooming each other, and parkouring off the neighborhood's A door opens, and out steps Red Bull, displaying the same shy smile he had on his face when he picked up my first Signal video call. He looks smaller than I imagined, very thin, but more put together than he did on my phone screen, with a button-up flannel shirt and a fresh haircut. Now that he's finally free, Red Bull has given me permission to reveal his real name: Mohammad Muzahir. I've been waiting a long time to meet with you and share everything, face-to-face,” Muzahir says after we've checked him into his hotel and we're riding in the SUV to mine. “I have no words to express it right now.” The three months between Muzahir's escape and this in-person meeting have been far from easy. Instead he has worked as a waiter and taken construction jobs to survive. When Muzahir isn't working or applying to jobs and universities abroad—so far without success—he obsessively researches scam operations on his phone, which is cracked on both front and back, with glitching lines across its damaged screen. In that research, Muzahir has come to believe that almost all of the men rounded up in the raids that displaced his compound were later released back into the Golden Triangle. He has also learned that the Boshang operation that indentured him has since relocated to Cambodia, taking many of his former coworkers with it. Muzahir sleeps as little as three hours a night, he tells me after we sit down in an empty lounge in the basement of my hotel. He's haunted, he says, by the fact that the scam compound he escaped, and dozens like it, are still operating and even expanding across lawless zones in Southeast Asia, and now other parts of the world. He feels crushing guilt, too, about the two people he scammed, even while telling himself it was a necessary precursor to his actions as a whistleblower. He dreams of earning enough to somehow pay the two men back. “Honestly this is not a happy ending to the story,” he says. After experiencing so many personal betrayals—and working for an operation where industrialized betrayal was, in fact, the business model—Muzahir's more fundamental problem is that he has trouble putting faith in anyone. “These people are just wasting time and giving false hope,” he wrote to me at one point. Somehow I've become an exception to that near-universal mistrust. But now that we're finally meeting in person, I feel compelled to confess to Muzahir that there were times when I didn't trust him—that even when he most needed my help, I still feared, incorrectly, that he might be scamming me. If I had paid off his contract or even paid his ransom, he points out, he would have left the compound before he had a chance to record and share the operation's full WhatsApp conversations. Muzahir is eager now for WIRED to release our full analysis of that data. I've pointed out to him that, when we do, the Chinese mafia could find a way to retaliate against him in India, or elsewhere if he follows through on his plan to leave the country. After everything he has suffered, Muzahir is still idealistic enough to hope that his experience will serve not only as a warning but as a source of inspiration to others like him. As he explains that decision, I can see more clearly than ever before the motivation driving every risk he has taken: He's speaking not only to me but to every potential resister or whistleblower inside the burgeoning scam compound industry and the global power structures that enable it, to its survivors, to the hundreds of thousands of other voiceless people trapped in its systems of modern slavery. “When someone reads about me, then maybe a lot of Red Bulls will stand up and speak,” Muzahir says with his usual shy smile. “When a lot of Red Bulls speak in this world, it will help to make things better.” Let us know what you think about this article.

It got acquired by a mental guy who was screaming about government propaganda and censorship (while doing Nazi salutes). Do you really think that if there was any government mandate to do anything like what the Russians are doing, he wouldn't have exposed it as "SEE, I TOLD YOU BIG GUBIMNT BAD!!" It's interesting you focus on "the west" when we have solid proof about e.g. Russian interference in many an election and protest via social media. From paid propagandist (e.g. Tim Pool) to the Internet Research Agency. The only factual information we have about anything remotely similar from "the west" was that research about Facebook activity in the Central African Republic being roughly 40/40/20 split between Russians, French, and actual locals. And even that isn't comparable because the French online campaign was mostly combatting Russian disinformation propaganda, not trying to bring about a coup or stoking tensions to get to a civil war.> Showing the result of the western sponsored genocide in GazaThe genocide in Gaza is not "sponsored" by the "west". Well, Hamas was for decades sponsored by entire West via UNRWA while their "from the river to the sea" slogan is as clearly expressed intent to commit genocide as one can wish for.

There's foreign bad-actor misinformation in every country (Iran too! )—it's cynical, and specious, to say that excuses governments who take away their citizens' internet access. New Caledonia admitted specific intent to target "organizing protests". That's exactly the reason why they shouldn't have the power to cut off their internet (though really, no one should). They've delegimitized the protestors; by censoring them, they're not "protecting" them from foreign actors in some well-meaning paternalistic way (their rationalization), they are rather continuing their political battle by other methods.It's an anti-pattern, all over the world right now, that groups of people who start off with irreconcilable political differences, devalue the legitimacy of the other group's speech and their right to speak it. One group calling another "mislead by propaganda" is an aspect of that delegimitization.

What about Russia blocking sites?As of late 2025 and early 2026, Russia has blocked numerous foreign communication, social media, and information services, restricting platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram (partially), Signal, Viber, FaceTime, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Many independent news, VPN services, and foreign websites (e.g., Chess.com) are also inaccessible Many independent news, VPN services, and foreign websites (e.g., Chess.com) are also inaccessible If we consider russia bad for doing those blocks above, then we should consider EU being bad when they do it for us. Of course we should not ban anything in the West. the end result is well... not good:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45323856 So, misteriously (suspicions of bribery abound) now they block full blocks of internet preventively, bringing down innocent and paying customers with them. From Law Enforcement to privatized Minority Report.Thats what people dislike. The government gets scared people will see some other propaganda from the other side, and censors it... and even that is done very selectively (daily mail is still accessible from over here, so are fox news and cnn)With spain it's even worse, because it's not even the government doing it, but the government giving the right of censorship to a private company which clearly abuses that right and the government tolerates this... no court orders, no judges, no way to complain, no fair use, no nothing, a private company decides and the government gives them a blank stamped paper to aprove that.Yes, i know iran has it much worse, but there's nothing we can do about it here, assuming the internet is banned for iranians and they can't read this or comment here.

They must stop.As in the Cold War, I would give an allowance for the West to still be preferable (modulo strict rights record) if they actually muster some sort of power to confront tyranny.

If South American dictatorships could have their way with less blood and less noise, don't you think they would prefer that?I'm reminded of a tragicomic recent admission from Nate Silver of 538 fame. He said Disney almost never interfered in their editorial process, as if that was a good thing. What that really meant, after all, was that Disney was perfectly willing to interfere in their editorial process, but almost never felt the need to. I mean, why would Disney care about political polling? )Could it similarly be that the UK government is perfectly willing to engage in brutal political suppression, but rarely has a need to? In that case maybe people are right to sound the alarm even though we haven't reached South American dictatorship levels yet.

And even if the man was wearing a proper "Palestine Action" shirt that'd still be pretty concerning. If you're not aware of the history of people being disappeared by states such as Chile under Pinochet, or more broadly what it means for a state to disappear someone, that's kinda on you.Either way these are not equivalent actions.Yes, it's suppression of free speech in a chilling manner.

There will not be several powerful countries, some widely hated in UK and openly preferring a UK in smoking ruins to democratic government in the UK, calling for revolution there (although don't get me wrong, UK too could totally could use a revolution). UK has a world-class surveillance apparatus, and doesn't have to contend with the cynical people running it getting regularly murdered or bought out by more powerful actors.What all this means - and this has been the core message of just about all dissidents in western countries for decades - is that the people with control in the UK don't have to gun down hundreds (or tens of thousands, if you believe the colored reports) in the streets to cling to power. If it was their best option, they might. If it was their best option, they might. I'm not trying to make any point at all beyond using a specific example in agreeing with the comments above mine that "Everything is the same and comparable never mind how hyperbolic. "But it seems to be construed as if I am, no matter how much I agree that the actions we're talking about are terrible. But it seems to be construed as if I am, no matter how much I agree that the actions we're talking about are terrible. It's a mistake to take things like trial by jury, open justice ( not secret courts ), non-arbitrary detention, even regular elections for granted.I totally agree with you that the UK is not Iran and there is too much hyperbole - but at the same time the current government is trying to criminalise legitimate protest, cancelling elections and trying to remove trial by jury for a substantial set of things  ( the ultimate protection against an authoritarian state ).As an example, it's very telling that the government ensured that in all the Assange legal proceedings it never went before a jury.The current government creating all these precedents, in the shadow of the prospect of a potential Reform government is something I think we should all be concerned about.

The idea that the state can deprive you of your freedom for a sentence likely to be less than 3 years without the chance to be tried before you peers, is worrying.Note is was six months before Nov 2024, it's 12 months now and they are looking to extend to 3 years! I have relatives in the UK, right now. And after this conversation I'm now more concerned for them than I was this morning, and I can make some educated guesses about why ol' mate didn't want to talk to you about Pinochet, who Wikipedia suggests died 20 years ago. Sounds like something is going on in the UK right now.I mean, seriously, I have left-wing family members who might be travelling to the UK this year.

I can't do anything about iran, i don't live there, neither does anyone else commenting here it seems... but many of us do live in EU, and are bothered by EU doing the same thing as iran, even if it's on a smaller scale (for now). You can't support censorship at home and then act outraged when someone else just implements more of it... even though some do, as long as the censored things are the things they personally don't like.To be fair, i'm more worried about UK, since it's a "test ground" to see how things work before the bad thing are implemented elsewhere, but either way, in my small country we have a saying, that "people should first sweep infront of their own doorways", and yeah, EU and our censorship is my doorway in this case.TLDR: if we're bothered by internet censorship, we should first stop at 'at home'.

You also don't live in the United States, or in Israel or Palestine but folks tend to forget that it seems.But you can do something anyway which is to be aware of the atrocities committed by Iran's regime, make sure your government is aware of your opinion, you can protest outside the Iranian embassy in your country, help Iranian dissidents, help Iranians find sneaky ways to get internet access, &c.I'm not expecting anyone to do those things but I find this “I don't live there” argument continue to creep up whenever it comes to Iran but it never enters conversation when it comes to specific other countries.> TLDR: if we're bothered by internet censorship, we should first stop at 'at home'.Sure but you don't have to focus on one issue at a time.

On the other hand, there are many people from EU here who need to hear it, that EU is doing the same as iran... censoring websites and more (IDs, chat control,...). Yes, maybe not at the same level, less sites are censored here, but censorship is still censorship, and the trend is going towards more control and more censorship.United states, israel (and palestine), etc. Are we bothered by what israel is doing in palestine? Sure... the germans can tell their government to stop selling weapons to israel [0], we can implement sanctions, tarrifs, etc. US is doing that to us (EU) with tarrifs every two weeks, but we didn't really properly respond, even under the threat of an invasion on greenland.Yes, restricted internet in iran is bad, but we can't stop it. Sadly, changing back EU rules is similarly hard to do, which again, is something that should be fixed, by us, at home. Are we bothered by what israel is doing in palestine?

You don't have to know what can be done, you can leave that up to others while demanding that the Iranian regime halt its indiscriminate mass murder of Iranian civilians before they make the number of people killed in Gaza look like a warmup.Not living in Iran doesn't mean you (an EU citizen I presume) can't do anything about the actions of that regime. > But what can you do for iran?You can encourage your governments to take action against Iran as well.

You don't have to know what can be done, you can leave that up to others while demanding that the Iranian regime halt its indiscriminate mass murder of Iranian civilians before they make the number of people killed in Gaza look like a warmup.Not living in Iran doesn't mean you (an EU citizen I presume) can't do anything about the actions of that regime.

Lets make this clear: "Spain" is not blocking, some ISP companies which have many users ask the judge for permission to block IP ranges because they are streaming football matches. As they have millions of users, the block feels huge, but it is not issued by the government.I am not a customer of those ISP, so my internet isn't disrupted at all during football matches. Some services, like annas-archive and torrent sites, are intermittently blocked, but you can easily avoid the blocks just by switching DNS server to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8.

Those who are commuting daily to lay down flight paths for russian missiles to kill Ukrainians - those have unrestricted internet access. In "normal" filtering situations, we can connect to most VPNs and do our stuff. When blackouts like these happen, EVERYTHING is blocked. The internet speed is also now at crawling speed so you really can't upload download anything.Also, in each blackout, people find ways to work around the censorship. We have almost ran out of ways to prevent the censorship now. Also, in each blackout, people find ways to work around the censorship. We have almost ran out of ways to prevent the censorship now. All other platforms (instant messengers, social media, news) are massively unpopular for being horrid to use at best, and government spyware at worst.To slow down the immediate damage the government has rolled back a few of the recent restrictions, hence why I can access HN. Among Google and a handful of other basic websites. Where almost all but a few big important services are blocked completely. This would have the bonus effect of making circumvention using VPNs and other methods even more difficult than it already is. Among Google and a handful of other basic websites. Where almost all but a few big important services are blocked completely. This would have the bonus effect of making circumvention using VPNs and other methods even more difficult than it already is. Can anyone recommend a good book, video course or other material to learn more about these topics? The way that I see it, its not just a technical problem anymore. It's about making the methods as diverse as possible and to some extent messing up the network for everyone. As an anecdotal data point, the network was quite tightly controlled / monitored around 2023 in Iran and nothing worked reliably. This was an unacceptably high collateral damage for the censors (? Vless and Trojan were the same at that time and didn't work or were blocked very quickly, but they started working ~reliably again until very recently. Be warned, the conclusion is:> We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that “unobservability by imitation” is a fundamentally flawed approach. > We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that “unobservability by imitation” is a fundamentally flawed approach. Now, if you're doing something unrelated that the administration doesn't like, you can expect VPN use to be included in the long list of charges. But polices in developed areas usually treat them like antragsdelikte(no trial without a complaint). Plus, the elites economic prosperity is also linked to their not being protests and for the toppling of govt to not occur and they might be willing to offset some losses to keep the average population in checkWhich sucks for the average iranian but we saw how their protests were cracked down with 20-30 THOUSAND people killed and Iran hiding bodies etc.I have heard that all shops are either shut down or running at the most minimum capacity. Economic prosperity just isn't a question now in Iran.

The government of Iran is an oppressive, immoral dictatorship.2. Invading Iran would be difficult, but totally destroying IRGC and military (as long as they side with the former) wouldn't be that hard. Dropping communications equipment and weapons to Iranian opposition groups wouldn't be hard either. i remeber when we start working on golang dev, and because its under google domain so many sub sites is blocked including golang ones, its very time consuming for chinese devs to develop golang projects, you have to figure out the VPN/goproxy... stuff.. This can be overriden to use "Starlink positioning" where the terminal ignores GPS signals and dtermines its position based on Starlink satellite signals. I think this is what is used in Ukraine where GPS is mostly jammed/spoofed to hell even far from the front.The GPS positioning is the default as it is likely more user friendly/has quicker lock in normal circumstances.Another venue of attack could be the Starlink WiFi AP included in the terminals- you could track that down.So in general:* switch the terminal to Starlink positioning* disable the Starkink terminal WiFi AP and conect by ethernet or connect an AP via ethernet with a new SSID and different MAC addressAnd it should be good to go.

While that gives some ideas of how widespread the jamming is, it won't give accurate information about the range (air traffic avoids areas with jamming) of the interference or any information from places where there is no commercial air traffic (war zones, etc). Much higher orbits for gnss satellites, much lower signal intensity.Also, starlink uses phased arrays with beamforming, effectively creating an electronically steerable directional antenna. It is harder to jam two directional antennas talking to each other, as your jammers are on the sides, where the lobes of the antenna radiation pattern are smaller.Still, we're talking about signals coming from space, so maybe it is just enough to sprinkle more jammers in an urban setting..

Still, we're talking about signals coming from space, so maybe it is just enough to sprinkle more jammers in an urban setting.. The components needed to build jammers and EW systems have been heavily commodified for a decade now (hell, your phone's power brick, car, and TV all have dual use components for these kinds of applications), and most regional powers have been working on compound semiconductors and offensive electronic warfare for almost a generation now. Iran was reported to have mobile units with a fairly short range that constantly roamed around, only hitting 2 of the 3 bands (Ku/Ka). They're also reported to have received mobile Russian military units capable of jamming all 3 (X/Ku/Ka) over a much wider area. (I'm not actually clear the extent to which X band is associated with either Starlink or Starshield. Starshield also reportedly operates to at least some extent in parts of the S band.

They have limited service because they can't afford anything better, and the USA prevents installing additional undersea cables, but only a small number of sites are blocked by Cuba itself, such as a few Spanish language news sites run by Cuban-Americans.Many more sites are unavailable in Cuba because their USA owners refuse access to Cuba, but that's not Cuba's fault.

After many years of heavy censorship on 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, there are a lot of accounts on Chinese BBS who say all the footage "AI generated". At the same time, I can see Apple caving to Iran governement - or China's - and restrict this feature to countries where it is legal. Let me remind you that many civilians died, including two children. Don't take my word for it:The following quote can be attributed to Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch:    “Customary international humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby traps – objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use – precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk and produce the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon today. The use of an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction. A prompt and impartial investigation into the attacks should be urgently conducted.” The following quote can be attributed to Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch:    “Customary international humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby traps – objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use – precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk and produce the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon today.

In fact, the official policy is that if you don't like it here, then you are are supposed to move out. As this plan failed economically, a side effect was that it only became common knowledge across society how big the gap in quality of life really was.The idea that free internet access will magically change the situation for Iranians on it's own is naive.

You could try to bifurcate into allied and non allied, but even that would be flawed, especially in countries like the USA where it becomes a first amendment right to try to ban such connectivity. Their elites will find workarounds and they'll leave the internet completely blocked apart from that. You do understand what's happening in Iran, right? Even with ublock Origin, these corporations will build a profile on me. Not so in Iran, where people can live without the watchful eye of Google looking at everything they do. I'm sorry but how tone-deaf can someone be? Over 12.000 people have been killed in the protests with some reports going up to 30.000 since then and here you are happy about the fact that Google cannot profile them anymore. Protesters are beeing shot on-masse in the streets and families from outside the country have no ideas if their brothers and sisters are even still alive. With that said, what in the actual fuck makes you say this when ten(s) of thousands are being murdered in conjunction with this ad-free period you're speaking so wistfully about? While you're at it, you can try explaining Ukranians why it's fine that Russia is invading them because America is bad. Because I guess you're not interested in my own personal experience of witnessing said people get killed either. But you seem to have a loose definition of "unconfirmed" [1] so I won't dwell on that.

To make my point clearer, I have an idea for you: In each of the countries you mentioned, go to the capital with a sign "I am against this regime, I want change" and see what happens. The main difference will be how much coverage your arrest will receive, depending on who arrests you and who covers the story. 0.03% of Iranians vs 3% of Gazans.I think we can all agree that Iran shouldn't be massacring its own nationals even if as the government claims they are foreign-influenced, but don't use this as a platform to push an agenda that harms even your own cause.

Sure, they all had moms and dads and to their families they were likely important and missed but there is a World of difference to the people left behind between some activist no one knows getting murdered by the state and their own families and acquaintances getting mowed down while they themselves are living precariously.This moral absolutism is relativism in disguise.edit: sorry, I shouldn't have replied to a political post however egregious.

Qatar spent $20B on education alone in the US. Qatar spent $20B on education alone in the US. Given the direct comparison and language of the parent comment, it's hard for me not to see an implied agenda here: Iran's regime is bad, they're islamists, just like Hamas, therefore Israel should be excused for having turned Gaza into a parking lot, or something along these lines. Our commitment to human rights should be strong enough to reject this sort of thinking and condemn every single one of these civilian deaths. The only real way to peace for gazans is to have a non Islamist government take over (like from the UAE) and re educate the population to not start training their children for intifada at the age of 3 or 4 and instead use some of the billions they've received in aid to build infrastructure and education. "local cop shoots innocent 80-year-old woman carrying groceries" is a story for a day at best, then the cop gets punished and we move on.Gaza is the same. In Iran, there's no such tension, we all agree that this is bad, shrug and move on.

The reason isn't that no one disagrees, it's that Qatar, Russia and China don't think the issue is divisive and have not launched a multi billion dollar propaganda campaign about it. "I said, "well, it was on the news." And then I went looking for articles about it. And y'know, I realized that unless you actually went looking, you probably wouldn't find those articles, even though they're only a few weeks old.What is super disappointing about this is that when the US does take action against the Iranian regime again, the reasoning is not going to be legible to most Americans. I don't really understand how this was erased so quickly. That meme about Columbia's campus being totally protest-free was pretty much on point. It's startling to see a large portion of the population being manipulated so thoroughly into being rabid about one thing and totally blind to another at the same time. Is having consistent values no longer a value? I said, "well, it was on the news." And then I went looking for articles about it.

This goes both ways and applies to all conflicts, but somehow we always cherry-pick the source that is not aligned with western interests as the "untrustworthy". I "cherry-pick" sources that do not spread lies. The ICJ seems more interested in truth and you may criticize how that went for them, or are they anti western in your book? I don't claim the bias was deliberate. The point is that we have internalized having to conform with the narrative of western (elite) interests, which in this case is to exert control on the region, resources and trade routes. The left loves Islamists even though Islamists are against everything the left stands for (women's rights, freedom of press, religion, sexuality, etc).I think Qatar's influence ($20B+ spent on US education) is the biggest factor here.

I think this comment is misguided enough / detached from reality enough to rightfully be flagged to death for being trite and not contributing anything to the discussion.Iranians lost internet than 3 weeks ago. Top 10 majority-Muslim countries, sorted by population:Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Morocco, Saudi ArabiaNow, the majority of those have problems with seeds in Western Imperialism, but the point is (a) the majority of those have problems (b) Iran's problems also have seeds in US interventions.The gap between how peaceful and educated most people are, and how bad governments are, is a phenomenon almost unique here. Figuring out how to bridge that gap is the major challenge.

UAE directly finances the sanguinary RSF in Sudan and CTS in Yemen, Saudi Arabia/Qatar has financed institutions behind the expansion of the Muslim Brotherhood/Salafism in the worlld and Turkey has a shaky economy with a large underbelly as well as engaging in their own brand of imperialism abroad. The rhetoric that Sweden, Germany, UK and France are Muslim countries is exclusivley used by very far-right standing people to fearmonger and hate against immigrants. What would it even mean for these countries to be Muslim? You still hear the bells of Christian churches everywhere. It's one thing to accuse someone of not replying to the "strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says", and another thing to accuse someone of "hate", which is a very serious accusation that requires proof beyond a shadow of a doubt, especially in the EU where strong anti libel laws apply.</p>
