                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dejected and deflated, where can Alex de Minaur turn after another sobering defeat to Carlos Alcaraz? 1 in the Australian Open quarter-finals having dropped just one set all fortnight. De Minaur had looked assured in straight-sets victories against Frances Tiafoe and Alexander Bublik, and from some corners of the tennis world there was quiet belief that the Australian might finally be able to trouble Alcaraz and improve on his 0-5 Lexus ATP Head2Head record against the Spaniard. For a brief spell, that belief felt justified. De Minaur matched Alcaraz's intensity early and stayed competitive through a high-quality first set, energising the crowd inside Rod Laver Arena. Alcaraz surged clear to seal a 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 victory in two hours and 15 minutes, once again exposing the gap De Minaur is still striving to close against the very best. “In terms of mentality or the way I committed to hitting the ball today, it's what I set out to do. I didn't really execute it for the whole match,” De Minaur said on his performance. “Of course, for me to take that next step, I've got to be comfortable in playing that sort of way for the whole match, and that's what it takes, to take it to the next level, especially against these types of guys.” You May Also Like: Alcaraz raises the bar vs. De Minaur, cracks SF code at Australian Open De Minaur has now exited at the quarter-final stage of a major on seven occasions, losing six times and withdrawing once through injury. “You just keep practising, keep working at it, keep getting to the stage of committing and playing at that level more frequently,” De Minaur said on how he makes the next breakthrough. “Then some tweaks here and there that's going to allow me to increase ball speed, because at the moment the way my natural groundstrokes are, they're quite flat, and it's quite difficult for me. “There is a whole lot of risk for me to play at a very high ball speed, and I feel like Jannik or Carlos, they have so many revolutions on the ball that they're able to not only play at a higher speed but also have their consistency, because they're able to get that spin that helps the ball come down and create different angles as well.” Australia is proud, @alexdeminaur 🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/8i3B4pHoWp— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 27, 2026 De Minaur has made significant progress in recent years. The 10-time tour-level titlist is competing at a career-high No. Yet he has been unable to make a notable impression against Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, losing all 19 matches contested between the two, a source of mounting frustration. “You try to do the right things, you try to keep on improving, but when the results don't come or the scoreline doesn't reflect those improvements, then of course you feel quite deflated,” De Minaur said. Alcaraz, who is aiming to complete the Career Grand Slam this fortnight, has yet to drop a set in Melbourne and has reached the semi-finals for the first time. “Then he's obviously got the ability to generate on command. If you leave one ball short, then the point's over. So he's definitely playing at a very high level. “I do think he's playing at a very high level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz moved to within two wins of completing the Career Grand Slam on Tuesday at the Australian Open, where he powered into his first semi-final at Melbourne Park. 1 absorbed and eventually neutralised the full force of Alex de Minaur's newly sharpened attacking approach, sealing a statement 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 victory in front of a vibrant Rod Laver Arena crowd. Chasing his seventh major title — and his first in Melbourne — Alcaraz set up a semi-final clash with last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. “I'm just really happy with the level that I'm playing every match, since the first round,” Alcaraz said. “I've been increasing my level each match. But they told me to be patient, that the level will come. FIRST AO SEMI-FINAL ✅@carlosalcaraz becomes the 8th Spanish man in history to reach the Australian Open semi-finals.7-5, 6-2, 6-1 vs de Minaur. Alcaraz struck with authority from the baseline, dictating play with conviction as he surged into the semi-finals without dropping a set. You May Also Like: Alcaraz chases No. 1 Club history as Career Grand Slam looms at Australian Open Following his fourth-round win over Alexander Bublik, De Minaur spoke candidly about his determination to avoid becoming a “punching bag” for the top players and to improve his ability to move opponents out of position. For a set, De Minaur delivered on that ambition. “It's really difficult," Alcaraz said when asked about playing De Minaur. But Alex puts you in a rush all the time, so you want to hit the ball as hard as you can, which is impossible against him. Alcaraz shifted gears decisively, suffocating the contest with relentless ball striking as he raced towards a two-hour, 15-minute victory. The win extended his Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage over De Minaur to 6-0, with the Australian having claimed just two sets across their rivalry, which began in 2022. After quarter-final exits at Melbourne Park in 2024 and 2025, Alcaraz has now improved to a 16-4 record at the tournament, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Awaiting him in the last four is a rematch of his 2024 quarter-final against Zverev, which the German won in four sets. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elina Svitolina dropped just three games against Coco Gauff in a 59-minute blitz to reach her fourth career Grand Slam semifinal, and first at the Australian Open. 12 seed needed just 59 minutes to extend her winning streak to 10 straight matches with a 6-1, 6-2 defeat of No. 3 seed Coco Gauff in the Australian Open quarterfinals. She advances to her fourth career Grand Slam semifinal, and first at the Australian Open. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play Last September, Svitolina ended her 2025 season early, citing a need "to heal and recharge." She collected her 19th career title in Auckland at the start of the year, and is now on the third-longest tour-level winning streak of her career. Indeed, Svitolina has only dropped one set in 2026 so far -- to Sonay Kartal in the Auckland quarterfinals. Svitolina trailed Kartal 5-3 in the third set before escaping 6-4, 6-7(2), 7-6(5). "Always been my dream to come back in Top 10 after maternity leave, that's always been my goal." Four of those have come at Grand Slams, all since her return from maternity leave. Gauff's pair of wins in the series both came in 2024, in the Auckland final and US Open third round -- both from a set down. The Ukrainian will bid to reach her first Grand Slam final against No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka, who is also on a 10-match winning streak and who leads their head-to-head 5-1 (and 2-0 on outdoor hard courts). Svitolina is the second Ukrainian to reach the Australian Open semifinals, following Dayana Yastremska in 2024. Should she defeat Sabalenka, she will become the first Ukrainian woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open Era. Since returning from maternity leave, Svitolina has worked hard to transform her counterpunching style into an aggressive, dynamic one. That was fully on show against Gauff: she struck 12 winners to Gauff's three, and in any given extended baseline rally was invariably the player who opened the court with changes of direction first. Her serve was also firing -- not just in its consistent high level (Svitolina won 71% of her first serve points) but in the moments she found her best deliveries. Svitolina's tally of four aces included one to seal a 3-0 second-set lead, and another at 3-1, 30-30 -- the only juncture of the match which felt like it could be a turning point. "For me it's all about trying to find new ways to win now," Svitolina said in her press conference. There's so many aggressive players who, if you're not at your best, they are just taking the match from you. So you have to evolve your game. For me, it's all about trying to be better every week, because you know, tennis evolvement is not stopping. So you have to always keep searching." Crucial for Svitolina was maintaining her focus and preventing any change in momentum. As quickly as the match was going, she was aware of Gauff's ability to pull off the comeback -- particularly having lost to her twice from a set up. "Of course, it's a good feeling and a bad feeling at the same time," Svitolina said. As Coco is such a great champion, you know, she came back couple of times in our matches being one set down. For me, I tried to keep building, keep trying to play well and tried to really stay focused from the start until the end." Elina Svitolina DOMINATING the first set with winners that got us going 🤩 @wwos • @espn • @tntsports • @wowowtennis • #AO26 pic.twitter.com/QchzwoVTFd Gauff's woes with her second serve and forehand are a familiar story by now, and both came to the fore on Tuesday. She served five double faults, all in the first set -- and in contrast to Svitolina's aces, the timing was as unhelpful as it could be. She served her first double fault to go down break point in the opening game; another pair (including on break point) to go down 2-1; and another pair in the final game, including on set point. Even her usually-solid backhand couldn't be relied upon -- Gauff struck nine unforced errors from that side, including a wide shot facing her first match point. "She played really well," Gauff said in her press conference. There was just a lot that didn't go well today. It's not like I just woke up and, yeah, today was a bad day, but bad days are often caused by your opponent. Usually I'm able to kind of scrap out at least to make the scoreline tighter, and then you never know, nerves can come up on her, something like that. Today I just wasn't able to do that." Elina Svitolina dropped just three games against Coco Gauff in a 59-minute blitz to reach her fourth career Grand Slam semifinal, and first at the Australian Open.</p>

With temperatures nearing 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Melbourne on Tuesday, the World No. 1 ended the 18-year-old American's dream run, earning a 6-3, 6-0 win in just under 90 minutes on Rod Laver Arena to reach her fourth consecutive Australian Open semifinal and the 14th Grand Slam semifinal of her career. 12 seed Elina Svitolina, who like Sabalenka, dropped only three games to take down Coco Gauff. Jovic entered the match against Sabalenka after earning her first Top 10 win at WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level over Jasmine Paolini in the third round, then backing it up with a dominant Round of 16 victory over Yulia Putintseva. "She's a young, great player," Sabalenka said to start her post-match press conference. "Super happy to get this win in straight sets, happy with the level I played today and yeah, (she's an) amazing player." Another extended game, this one nearly nine minutes and featuring four deuces, kept Jovic within reach at 4-2. Sabalenka, meanwhile, raced through her service games and secured another routine hold for 5-2. And it resulted in a Sabalenka hold to capture the opening set in exactly one hour, punctuated by a backhand winner -- her 21st winner of the set. 1 ran away with it, delivering a second-set bagel to eliminate one of the four American women left in the draw. In her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, Jovic mustered enough energy to earn a pair of break points in the final game, but Sabalenka saved the second with an ace before closing out the match with her seventh and final ace. "The second set, I felt like I had to step in and put even more pressure on her," Sabalenka said. Congrats on a career-best Grand Slam run, Iva! Here are more numbers from Sabalenka's quarterfinal victory: Since 1988, only Sabalenka, Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis have reached eight or more in a row. 31 on match point, while finishing with just 17 unforced errors. Her 143 total winners are the most of any woman at this year's Australian Open. Despite a brief struggle with her second serve late in the opening set, the performance was more than enough to ensure she was never broken. Sabalenka's improved variety was on display as she won five of six points at the net and mixed in a handful of slices and the occasional drop shot to disrupt Jovic's rhythm. Bonus…5: Sabalenka has at least five career wins against both potential semifinal opponents. She'll face the winner of Coco Gauff and Elina Svitolina.</p>

Aryna Sabalenka said that her Australian Open quarterfinal victory over American teenager Iva Jovic was a match to remember. "It was a welcome change, as far as Sabalenka was concerned, from the three rounds immediately preceding the quarterfinals, where she suffered from lapses in concentration after building big leads. "The second set, I felt like I have to step in and put even more pressure on her, because I can see that she's young, she's hungry, and I could tell during the match that no matter what's the score, she's still going to be there trying and trying to figure her way," she said. "I think it really helped me kind of, like, just go for my shots and help me to trust my game. Yeah, that was definitely amazing performance in the second set."
