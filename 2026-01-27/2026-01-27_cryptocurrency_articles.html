                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Forgotten Runiverse, the fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) on Ethereum scaling network Ronin, is going offline until further notice. “Over the past months, we've faced a number of overwhelming challenges,” the Forgotten Runiverse team wrote on X. “While our team worked tirelessly and was initially able to overcome many of these obstacles, we've reached a point where it no longer makes sense financially to maintain the game in a live environment in its current state.” The open world spawned out of the lore from the Ethereum NFT collection Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult, and launched globally last year after hosting a stress test which asked users to “crash its servers.” But less than a year after launch, its free-to-play, browser-based game servers will be taken offline on Tuesday. The MMORPG's shuttering continues the trend of crypto games that have been forced to close their doors as funding dries up and games struggle to garner adoption. Last year, numerous high-profile blockchain games including Deadrop, Nyan Heroes, and Pirate Nation shut down, and the carnage appears to be continuing into 2026. GG Story of the Year 2025: Crypto Gaming Collapses as Funding Dries Up As a result, crypto gaming enthusiasts were not entirely surprised on social media, with mixed replies ranging from disappointment to praising the team for their efforts. Forgotten Runiverse, which had raised funds from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and others, was at one point approved for development across Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom, who previously led BlackRock's digital assets strategy, framed the Ethereum-versus-Solana debate as a mismatch between narrative and actual institutional behavior: TradFi firms may praise speed and low fees, but the highest-value financial use cases are gravitating to networks optimized for trust, security, and liquidity. Speaking with CoinDesk's Jennifer Sanasie on Jan. 26, Chalom said he would avoid positioning his view as opinion and instead point to what he called observable market signals. “The fact is that Ethereum has been around for 10 years. And I talk about both the layer 1 mainnet as well as the long set of layer 2s who help do that rollup strategy.” That longevity, in his telling, matters because institutions aren't selecting chains the way consumers pick apps. They're selecting settlement rails for moving money, tokenizing assets, and representing ownership, workflows where operational failure and security assumptions are existential. Solana, Chalom acknowledged, has carved out a reputation for performance. Chalom's thesis is that when the use case is “tokenizing assets” and “moving money,” the decision criteria compress into three buckets. “The real institutions who care only about three things,” he said, are “trust, security, and liquidity.” On that basis, he argued, “they're building on Ethereum for high value projects,” adding: “It's happening on Ethereum.” He also anchored the comparison in stablecoin and tokenized-asset activity, citing a sharp share gap as evidence of where the market is allocating serious volume. “More than 65% of stablecoins and tokenized assets are happening there,” Chalom said, describing that as “10x what you see on Salana.” He reinforced the directional claim immediately after: “Ethereum leads in high quality assets in DeFi, tokenization, and stable coins by a factor of 10 to one over Salana. Still, Chalom did not argue for a single-chain world. Instead, he mapped Ethereum and Solana to different product surfaces based on security tolerance. “I do think there's a role for cheap, fast, less secure chains,” he said, and suggested Solana's comparative advantage shows up where finality speed and cost trump institutional-grade assurances. “I think Solana will win in the memecoin, maybe the gaming space where actually security matters a lot less and speed matters more.” Chalom insisted this is not about persuasion so much as migration patterns. Notably, SharpLink Gaming (Nasdaq: SBET) has emerged as one of the largest corporate ETH holders, with public trackers putting its holdings at roughly 864,840 ETH (about $2.5B at recent marks). Ever since he heard about Bitcoin, he has been studying the topic every day and trying to share his knowledge with others. Besides BTC and crypto, Jake studied Business Informatics at a university.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rotating cast of top candidates has roiled Polymarket betting on the next chair of the Federal Reserve, but the new favorite, BlackRock's Rick Rieder, has argued that bitcoin will replace gold and has recommended people should have it in their portfolios. Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income, has rocketed to the top of the list of President Donald Trump's likely picks in the prediction markets, and he's frequently waxed supportive of cryptocurrencies. He said as far back as 2020 — in much earlier days of digital assets — that bitcoin would take over for gold as a store of value, "because it's so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around," he said in a CNBC interview. And more recently, he told the same outlet that bitcoin should be part of a smart investment mix, saying that the leading digital token and gold were "things that give you a little bit of ballast in the portfolio." In that September interview, when bitcoin was still above $112,000, he predicted "it's going to go up." The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $88,000, having fallen recently on possible tariffs and other geopolitical turmoil. Trump has a choice to make before the term of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — who the president has framed as his economic nemesis — is set to expire on May 15. It was Trump who originally placed Powell, a Republican, in that pivotal role, but the president has since routinely lamented his performance, calling him "dumb" and "stupid" and nicknames such as "Mr. Too Late." Rieder has said it's "an unbelievably honor to even be mentioned in that list." In a recent interview during the president's trip to Davos in Switzerland, Trump called Rieder "very impressive," and his odds on Polymarket have climbed from under 3% to almost 53% at their height, before settling at a current 48%. For the crypto sector, a Fed chair can pull multiple levers. Though Powell is departing soon as chairman, his term as a regular governor on the Fed board continues, leaving some question about whether he'll take the traditional route and exit after his leadership expires or stay on another two years. Every member of the board has an automatic seat on the Federal Open Market Committee that decides U.S. interest rates, meaning a Powell decision to stay would keep his generally centrist position in place in that group and would fail to open another seat for a Trump appointee. Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale. Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token. While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finding a true 50X opportunity in crypto usually comes down to timing and structure. This list looks at five altcoins with different growth drivers, ranging from infrastructure and AI to real-world finance. Among them, Digitap ($TAP) stands out for a simple reason: it is still early, focused on everyday use, and structured around participation rather than hype. Digitap earns the first spot because it balances risk and opportunity better than most early projects. Instead of chasing narratives, Digitap focuses on how people actually use money. Digitap is currently in Round 3 of its presale, with the $TAP token priced around $0.0439. As features roll out and users join, value grows through usage rather than speculation. That is why many investors now describe Digitap as the best crypto presale candidate for those looking ahead to 2026. Key strengths include a unified account experience, privacy-first access, real-world spending support, smart routing to reduce fees, and multi-chain compatibility. An upcoming Solana deposit option further improves access by allowing users to fund accounts directly from the Solana ecosystem, strengthening Digitap's role as a practical, everyday financial platform even during market slowdowns. Kaspa positions itself as a high-performance Layer-1 built for speed and scalability. Its blockDAG design allows faster confirmation times without sacrificing security. However, it also faces strong competition from other scalable blockchains. For aggressive investors, Kaspa offers growth potential, but its trajectory depends on sustained ecosystem expansion. Render offers exposure to the growing demand for AI and GPU computing. As demand for compute increases, platforms like Render can benefit from broader adoption. While the AI narrative is strong, it also comes with volatility tied to market sentiment. Render fits investors looking for sector-specific exposure rather than everyday financial use. Chainlink plays a critical role in crypto infrastructure by providing reliable data feeds to blockchains. Its model allows users to store data indefinitely with a one-time fee. This appeals to developers and organizations that value long-term data integrity. Arweave's potential depends on whether permanent storage becomes a standard requirement for applications and records. Lists and rankings help narrow choices, but timing matters more than position. The biggest gains often come from entering before mass attention arrives. Among these five projects, Digitap stands out because it combines early entry with real utility rather than hype. Looking toward 2026, platforms that people actually use tend to hold value better than those driven purely by trading. Digitap's presale stage, clear use case, and growing feature set place it in a strong position as adoption expands, especially as access continues to improve across ecosystems like Solana. This practical focus gives it an edge as markets mature. For investors thinking long term, structure matters more than short-term excitement. Digitap's steady development and everyday financial approach make it one of the best crypto coins to invest in for 2026, offering a balanced path built on use, not speculation.

Potential data privacy risksWhilst many of the potential risks associated with agentic AI are the same or similar to those associated with generative AI, there are certain novel risks associated with agentic AI, including: Organisations remain responsible for data protection compliance of the agentic AI they develop, deploy or integrate in their systems and processes. Potential mitigations Organisations should use privacy by design and privacy-friendly innovation in agentic AI. The ICO encourages exploration of tools which could assist with: The ICO also uses a capability / adoption matrix to explore different future scenarios relating to agentic AI and how this might shape their regulatory intervention in the future. Wider regulatory interest and collaboration In the EU, the European Data Protection Supervisor recently released a podcast on agentic AI, which echoes agentic AI's potential to compound the risks we already recognise about generative AI – such as errors cascading through multiple decisions before being spotted, or compounding the negative impacts of a system trained on biased data. Next stepsThe ICO is keen to emphasise that the Report is only their early-stage thinking and that they welcome contact from any stakeholders wishing to continue the conversation (by emailing emergingtechnology@ico.org.uk). AI continues to be a priority for the ICO, with a statutory code on AI and ADM expected this year and the ICO committing to hold workshops and other engagement exercises around the topic of agentic AI. Agentic AI has the potential to enable fundamental changes, such as consumer behaviour in the retail sector, where marketing will need to appeal to algorithms rather than individuals, and this will have a direct impact on business strategies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The majority of enterprises — including leading payments companies, global banks, fintech platforms, and asset managers — are not looking to build or manage blockchain infrastructure. They want to solve a specific business problem: faster settlement, better liquidity, lower reconciliation risk, and so on. They also know that blockchain technology can help them achieve these goals. They're interested — but recognizing the value of blockchain often isn't enough: Enterprises need a clear path to implementation to address their problems. What matters is not incentives or loyalty, but whether a concrete use case creates enough operational or economic upside (e.g., cost savings, better efficiency, fee compression) to justify engagement. From development and deployment to ongoing infrastructure management, protocol teams should make it as easy as possible for an enterprise to use their product — whether that means deploying a blockchain network, incorporating stablecoin infrastructure, or enabling an enterprise to interact with an onchain application. Enterprises don't adopt solely because they believe in your chain; they adopt because someone else does the work to solve their problem. Even well-intentioned pitches like “You could issue your asset here” or “You could run payments on our chain” can come across as a request to take on blockchain infrastructure these teams don't want to own or operate. To a corporate counterpart, these pitches may sound like: “Run your own payments network.” And that's almost certainly not what they want. A protocol's work is less about selling blockchain directly to these enterprises. It's more about aligning their needs with existing tech by orchestrating solutions. Most protocol teams don't have the services capacity to design, integrate, and operate production systems on behalf of these customers. In other words, the protocol teams that succeed make it easier to ship real deployments without forcing enterprises to own or operate the underlying infrastructure. First, it solves corporates' problems, just like any other tech solution. Second, it's familiar to corporates: Just as companies outsource critical but non-core infrastructure like payments, custody, or compliance, most will rely on their existing partners to handle anything that touches the chain. And in many cases, they're already accustomed to leaning on large integrators (like Accenture or Deloitte) to manage complex technical builds on their behalf. In South Korea, for instance, large conglomerates historically tried to own the entire blockchain stack. But after seeing the challenges of operating their own L1s, many have shifted towards piloting on existing chains or using modular stacks like Avalanche subnets or OP Stack. Across markets, these dynamics shape how enterprises engage with blockchain infrastructure. These engagement patterns largely tend to fall into three major categories. For protocol teams working with enterprise partners, the core question isn't whether enterprises will use blockchain infrastructure, it's how to position the protocol so enterprises can engage without taking full operational ownership. In practice, most enterprise engagement falls into one of three categories: Some teams are also exploring adjacent models, from co-managed networks operated by multiple institutions (e.g., Canton) to interoperability layers that connect existing chains (e.g., LayerZero). But these models all reinforce the same principle: Corporates don't want to own infrastructure; they want it to work for their use case. For example, banks evaluating public blockchains often cite upgrade predictability as a concern: Each time the chain upgrades, they would need to depend on a validator set they don't control to adopt the new version. Across all three paths above, the same principle holds: Corporates don't want to own infrastructure. The goal isn't open-ended co-development or accommodating endless, bespoke requests; it's getting your current solution deployed in the real world as quickly and credibly as possible. At this stage, “winning” means empowering the right partners to deliver, even if it means accepting some loss of autonomy over the final implementation. In the enterprise context, your “killer app” isn't a consumer product. A thoughtful design partner model can help capture this shift well. In this context, a design partner isn't just an early customer or integration. For chains that haven't launched yet, design partners create a critical feedback loop: They help shape the network around real workflows long before mainnet. For chains already live, engaging design partners can help refine the roadmap and even amplify GTM by creating credible reference partners, tightening integrations, validating use cases, and pressure-testing the network under real operational conditions. A strong design partner program goes beyond logo swaps and surface-level co-marketing. What matters is depth of engagement: design partners are involved in real product feedback cycles, and when the protocol is ready, real integration work, production workflows and live deployments. Without this level of engagement, early visibility may spike, but it rarely translates into meaningful, long-term adoption – especially when another option makes integration easier or more directly serves the use case. For instance, Avalanche's Evergreen subnets work with traditional financial institutions to pilot tokenized asset infrastructure, where Avalanche manages the network layer and partners bring distribution. In another example, Base's integration work with Coinbase's enterprise clients, and Circle's collaborations with banks and PSPs, follows the same logic: Abstract complexity away from corporates while empowering existing partners to operationalize blockchain benefits without having to stand up their own infrastructure. In each of these cases, partners make the chain usable for enterprises without requiring them to run infrastructure themselves or build out their own custom solutions. That means your GTM focus as a protocol team should shift from “convince corporates” to “enable partners.” Make it effortless for integrators, processors, and custodians to build on your behalf. This could include traditional consulting or technology implementation firms like Accenture or Deloitte, who routinely handle large digital-transformation programs and are already embedded with enterprise clients. It could also include more specialized technology providers like Alchemy, Fireblocks, or Chainalysis, who enterprises rely on for node access, custody, or compliance workflows. In some verticals, this may also extend to processors like Stripe or Worldpay, or custody and settlement providers like Anchorage, who can embed your chain directly into the services enterprises already consume This could look like a series of joint technical deep-dives, co-branded enablement sessions for their deployment teams, or quickstart demos that show how your infrastructure plugs into existing tooling. Some teams even produce public-facing recorded walkthroughs or sandbox demos that partners can share with clients during discovery. These two motions — combined with providing up-to-date documentation — can help streamline the process of getting partners to actually start closing deals for you. They'll be the ones whose infrastructure becomes the default choice because partners can use it to deliver real value to enterprises – seamlessly and for specific use cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Bitcoin plunged below $90,000, it has been struggling to reclaim those levels. Additionally, the Pump.fun price also surged extensively and reached a critical turning point. With these moves, it appears the AltSeason could be nearby, but observing the on-chain data reveals that altcoins are at a structural turning point, but not a comfort zone. Most notably, a key support zone, one that previously acted as a base during accumulation phases and sustained multiple rallies, has now flipped into resistance. The latest retest of this level resulted in a clear rejection, signaling that buyers are no longer in control at this range. While prices are still holding near recent lows, the failure to reclaim this former support suggests increasing downside risk. From here, altcoins face a narrow window: either reclaim this resistance quickly and re-establish acceptance, or risk entering a prolonged phase of weak bounces, lower highs, and sustained underperformance as liquidity and attention rotate elsewhere. As of January 26, 2026, this represents an approximate 0.8% decline in stablecoin supply, coinciding with Bitcoin pulling back toward the $87,000 level. Stablecoins act as the primary liquidity fuel for altcoin speculation. When their supply contracts instead of expanding, it suggests capital is leaving risk assets rather than rotating within crypto. In parallel, growing allocations toward gold and silver point to a broader risk-off rotation. Until stablecoin market caps stabilize and begin expanding again, the conditions required for a sustained altseason remain structurally weak. Current market conditions continue to reflect softening momentum across altcoins, contracting stablecoin liquidity, and a broader rotation toward defensive assets. Together, these factors do not support the kind of sustained, broad-based rally typically associated with a full altseason. Adding to this view, Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine, has highlighted the ongoing FOMO-driven rally in gold and silver as a key force diverting liquidity away from crypto markets. According to Lee, this rotation has acted as a temporary ceiling on crypto upside. However, he also notes that once momentum in traditional safe-haven assets fades, capital could rotate back aggressively into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead, 2026 is more likely to see selective, rotation-driven rallies. Here, only certain altcoins demonstrate strong bullish phases at intermittent intervals rather than a synchronised market-wide surge. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After several years of development, Zama recently announced its launch on mainnet with the first Confidential USDT (cUSDT) transfer on Ethereum. It took Zama only three days to grow Total Value Shielded (TVS) above $100m, something that took other Ethereum-based privacy protocols multiple years. The protocol experienced no downtime, and was able to keep up with the throughput of Ethereum itself, proving that FHE is now production-ready and can be used at scale by anyone building a financial application on the blockchain. The Zama ICO was done through a confidential sealed-bid Dutch auction. After studying more than a hundred TGEs, auctions were identified as offering the best balance of fair distribution, price discovery, and capital efficiency. Confidentiality is critical: when participants can see others' bids, price discovery becomes distorted as people react to one another rather than bidding what they truly believe. Participants picked a price (public) and an amount (private). The upcoming pre-TGE sale will give a chance to participants who did not get their bids filled in the auction to buy $ZAMA tokens at the auction clearing price, with a $10k participation cap. $ZAMA tokens will be distributed as standard ERC-20 tokens, fully unlocked and immediately usable for paying encryption and decryption fees on the Zama Protocol. All $ZAMA holders can stake their tokens on their choice of operators to earn rewards and help secure the Zama Protocol. Using the Zama Portfolio, anybody can start to shield and send confidential tokens. Finally, blockchain gets its HTTPS moment, marking the end of fully transparent transactions. Zama is an open-source cryptography company building state-of-the-art FHE solutions for blockchain. Its technology enables a broad range of use cases, from confidential finance to Web3 and network states.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Citi lifts silver prices target, says move to $300 is "extremely unlikely" Bitcoin was framed as protection against inflation and monetary excess. Ethereum was positioned as the foundation of a parallel digital economy. For years, investors believed these assets could move on their own terms, detached from Wall Street cycles. Recent market behavior shows crypto moving increasingly in step with U.S. equities, especially growth and technology stocks. When the Nasdaq climbs, Bitcoin and major altcoins often follow. When bond yields rise and equity valuations compress, crypto tends to fall even harder. Instead of acting as a hedge or alternative system, crypto is starting to resemble a leveraged version of the broader risk trade. The growing overlap between crypto and equities reflects who now drives trading activity. In earlier cycles, price action was dominated by retail speculation and industry-specific events. Asset managers, hedge funds, and proprietary trading firms now treat crypto as part of their global allocation decisions. When financial conditions loosen, capital flows into high-growth assets, including technology stocks and digital tokens. Employment data, inflation readings, and central bank guidance now influence crypto prices alongside traditional assets. In practical terms, crypto has joined the class of high beta assets. They outperform during periods of optimism and underperform when fear dominates. One of the strongest links between crypto and equities is interest rate sensitivity. They also lower the present value of future growth and adoption, which weighs on assets priced for long-term potential. Companies whose profits lie far in the future suffer most when discount rates rise. Crypto follows a similar pattern because much of its value rests on expectations of future usage and network growth rather than current cash flow. Investors become more comfortable taking risk, and capital rotates back into growth-oriented assets. Crypto often responds with outsized gains, reinforcing its role as a high beta expression of broader market sentiment. Statements from the Federal Reserve now shape crypto prices just as they do equity indices and bond markets. What once appeared detached from monetary policy is now firmly embedded within it. Bitcoin is increasingly described as a proxy for risk appetite. Ethereum is treated as a leveraged bet on digital activity and innovation. Smaller tokens are viewed as speculative extensions of that theme. This is the same framework investors use for equity sectors. The introduction of exchange-traded products tied to Bitcoin has reinforced this change. These vehicles allow institutions to hold crypto exposure using familiar tools. As a result, digital assets are now included in portfolio models alongside stocks and bonds. Several forces explain why crypto has lost much of its independent behavior. Most of the capital now comes from professional investors whose decisions are driven by returns and risk control rather than ideology. They respond to inflation data, employment reports, and interest rate expectations in the same way equity traders do. Futures and options markets magnify price swings in both directions. This dynamic is familiar in equity markets, where margin calls amplify sell-offs. Third, stablecoins and tokenized financial instruments have linked crypto more closely to the dollar system. Rather than existing as a parallel economy, much of crypto activity now depends on dollar liquidity. Together, these changes have pulled crypto deeper into the structure of traditional finance. Despite this convergence, crypto has not fully surrendered its unique drivers. Regulatory announcements, security breaches, and protocol upgrades can still move prices independently of macro trends. Periods of rapid technological development have produced temporary decoupling in the past. The distinction is that these internal factors now compete with macro forces rather than replacing them. Innovation can lift prices, but it must operate within a broader financial environment shaped by interest rates and liquidity. For investors, this evolution changes how crypto should be understood. Its diversification value is weaker than it once appeared. If crypto rises and falls with technology stocks, it behaves less like an alternative asset and more like an extension of the growth trade. Crypto tends to struggle during tightening cycles and thrive when financial conditions ease. That pattern aligns it with other speculative assets and reduces the usefulness of narratives about insulation from monetary policy. At the same time, its high beta character can be attractive. When confidence returns and liquidity expands, crypto often outperforms traditional markets. Treating crypto as fundamentally detached from Wall Street ignores how deeply it has been absorbed into global capital flows. Crypto's journey from outsider to mainstream asset has reshaped its market behavior. Instead of moving on its own logic, it increasingly reflects the forces that drive equities and bonds. This does not erase crypto's technological promise, but it changes its investment identity. Digital assets still represent new financial infrastructure, yet they now trade within the same macro framework as high growth stocks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has given China an opportunity to strengthen its grip on the global economy. Over the past year, Beijing has promoted greater usage of its digital renminbi as an alternative in cross-border payments. “While it's unlikely to upset the dollar dominance applecart anytime soon, it certainly should be looked at as a statement of intent by China,” Sean Tuffy, a financial regulation expert, told DL News. Higher demand for the renminbi will strengthen its value, which is something China's President Xi Jinping is increasingly pressured to do. If the yuan's value rises, then it will be cheaper for Chinese businesses to import goods and boost the currency's attractiveness for emerging economies where Beijing wants to assert its influence. The yuan, by contrast, represented 8.5% of all transactions. And while the digital yuan may provide a smoother, cheaper experience than traditional payment rails, dollar-pegged stablecoins offer similar advantages for the greenback — and at scale. Dollar-pegged stablecoins make up 99% of the $311 billion market, according to DefiLlama data. Emerging economies where China seeks to exert financial and geopolitical influence have been key drivers in that growth, Ari Redbord, global head of policy at blockchain investigations firm TRM Labs, told DL News. “Rather than accelerating de-dollarisation, the past few years have arguably reinforced dollar dominance in digital form,” Redbord said, echoing an argument the US crypto industry has championed for years. Even so, those challenges aren't stopping the PBoC's global central bank digital currency rollout efforts. The PBoC's international digital yuan push is a long time coming. Since it first rolled out a string of domestic pilots in China in 2019, it has also promoted the use of the CBDC for cross-border payments. In December, the digital yuan took its first steps into Southeast Asia, finding use as a payment tool in cross-border trade between China and nearby Laos — with the PBoC hinting at further initiatives down the line. The central bank has also launched initiatives to enable widespread use of the digital yuan alongside other nations' CBDCs. A CBDC interoperability project, mBridge, has processed over $55 billion in international trade transactions since 2022, according to a January report from the Atlantic Council think tank. For instance, Russia could use the digital yuan “in the future, as could some Association of Southeast Asian Nations members and Latin American countries,” Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation, told DL News. “Given its scale, sophistication, and integration into national strategy, the digital yuan is likely to remain a central feature of China's economy and of the global future of money debate for years to come,” said Alisha Chhangani, associate director for future of money at the Atlantic Council. Tim Alper and Eric Johansson both report on international markets for DL News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has published updated guidance on international transfers of personal information, aiming to simplify compliance under the UK GDPR and reduce complexity for businesses handling cross-border data flows. Released on 15 January, the refreshed guidance introduces a clearer structure for organizations navigating transfer rules, including a new “three step test” to determine when restricted transfers apply. The update also expands content in areas where organisations frequently seek clarification, particularly around roles and responsibilities in multi-layered transfer scenarios — an increasingly common issue as companies rely on global cloud providers, processors and sub-processors. New tools include a brief guide, glossary and quick-reference FAQs designed for organizations without specialist privacy expertise. The ICO said further enhancements are underway, including updated transfer risk assessment (TRA) guidance, additional detail on international data transfer agreements (IDTAs) and cloud services, and an interactive tool to help assess whether transfers are restricted. Planned improvements also include examples and case studies to reflect real-world global transfer models, acknowledging the growing complexity of legal and technical arrangements in cross-border digital infrastructure. To support implementation, the ICO will host a webinar outlining key changes and practical considerations for organiations making or advising on restricted transfers. International data transfers remain a central issue for UK regulators after Brexit, with the government seeking to position the UK as a competitive hub for data-driven businesses while maintaining continuity with global privacy standards. The ICO said the latest update aligns with that strategy, promoting clarity while ensuring adequate protections for individuals whose personal information is transferred overseas.
