NFL RedZone host Scott Hanson, 54, has fueled conspiracy theories as he shared a graphic posted by the league in early September 2025. The image depicts players from each NFL franchise facing Levi's Stadium and a giant Lombardi Trophy. But a spokesperson from the NFL has come out to categorically deny these claims. NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy has responded to this suggestion on social media. McCarthy quote posted the original image with a short answer for fans on X.

This means that similar theories could have spawned if the New York Giants, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or Jacksonville Jaguars made it. Yet this has not stopped fans believing that McCarthy's statement is confirmation of the conspiracy. “well good thing you cleared that up… NOBODY will think its true now,” one fan posted on X. Someone in authority saying “no” and thinking that means something,” another shared. Super Bowl LX has been surrounded by several controversies including pop punk band Green Day's announcement as the pre-game entertainment. Both sides will also practice away from Levi's Stadium as fans raise injury fears about the nearby electrical substation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Funding cuts, conspiracy theories and ‘powder keg' pine plantations have seen January's forest fires tear through Chubut in southern Argentina Lucas Chiappe had known for a long time that the fire was coming. For decades, the environmentalist had warned that replacing native trees in the Andes mountain range with highly flammable foreign pine was a recipe for disaster. “The dragon chased us until we crossed the river, and we had to speed between two fire columns along a trail barely a kilometre wide.” Since 5 January, more than 36,000 hectares (90,000 acres) of native forests, grasslands, villages and tourist resorts in Patagonia have been ravaged by wildfires, mainly in the southern Argentine province of Chubut, according to the Federal Emergency Agency (AFE). Wildfires are also hitting Chile, with at least 18 people killed this month. “This year has not had enough snowfall; there are low humidity levels and a high accumulation of combustible elements in the forest” – a reference to monoculture pine plantations, which act as “powder kegs”. President Javier Milei's government has systematically defunded the National Fire Management Service (SNMF), resulting in a reduction of 81% on last year's budget. Prevention efforts, such as building firebreaks and community engagement, have been hampered, with firefighters forced to work in poor conditions and for low salaries. Alejo Fardjoume, a representative of the national parks' union, says monthly salaries for firefighters range from 650,000 to 850,000 pesos (£336-£440). The budget cuts, says Nápoli, also affect early-warning systems and aerial support, with firefighting aircraft flight hours being cut from 5,100 to 3,100. “We use chainsaws, rakes, hoses, motor pumps – everyday objects,” says Diego Calfuqueo, a raspberry farmer. Chiappe says solidarity takes precedence over bureaucracy and social classes. Last week, Milei – who did not travel to the affected area – posted an AI-generated image of himself shaking hands with firefighters on Instagram, calling them “heroes”. “It's a little hypocritical and cynical,” says a local firefighter, Hernán Mondino, adding that many of his colleagues have to take on other jobs to make ends meet. According to Hernán Giardini, forests coordinator at Greenpeace, government policy now aligns with Milei's claims that a human-made climate crisis does not exist. Last week, the national security minister alleged on X that “preliminary evidence suggests that these crimes are linked to terrorist groups calling themselves Mapuche”. “If one people is defending their territory and setting limits on this extractivist capitalism, it is the Mapuche people,” says Mauro Millán, a Mapuche leader from the Pillan Mahuiza community, near Los Alerces national park, which was also affected by the wildfires. Last year, he says, police raided his community due to similar allegations, but the case was dropped. Mapuche communities are not the only ones being blamed. Some politicians and media pundits have blamed Israeli citizens and even the Israeli government, reviving an old antisemitic conspiracy theory, the “Andinia Plan”, which claims that Jews want to establish a state in Patagonia. Milman says that discourse had long been confined to far right circles, but is now also used by people who oppose Milei. They do not correlate with anything in reality,” says Giardini. “We are talking about an extremely biodiverse area, with places that have even been designated as protected sites for the preservation of the huemul deer,” he says, highlighting that the local population's housing, jobs and health will be seriously affected.</p>
