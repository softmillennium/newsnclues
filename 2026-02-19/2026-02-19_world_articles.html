Top administration officials reported that the White House has been told that the U.S. is ready to strike Iran as soon as this weekend, CBS News reports, with other news outlets confirming. On Thursday, at opening remarks for his “Board of Peace” event, Trump said that “you're going to be finding out probably over the next 10 days” whether the U.S. will attack Iran. He once again threatened Iran to negotiate a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, or else “bad things will happen.” Reports find that the military is, indeed, prepared for a significant operation. Trump has not yet made the final decision on whether to strike, outlets have reported. Israel, which has long urged the U.S. to initiate war with Iran, may participate in potential attacks. Trump does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally launch a war with Iran. Representatives Ro Khanna (D-California) and Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) have said that they are planning to force a vote on a War Powers Resolution next week in hopes of preventing strikes. Or will the neoconservatives mislead us once again?” said Khanna on social media. Polling has shown that a war or other military action against Iran is unpopular. In January, Quinnipiac found that only 18 percent of U.S. voters support taking military action against Iran if the government continued killing protesters. Shortly after last year's strikes, 85 percent of people said in a YouGov poll that they opposed war with Iran. Trump is demanding that Iran end all domestic uranium enrichment, seemingly making demands for a new nuclear deal despite having withdrawn from one during his first term in office. “The president has always been very clear, though, with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option, and Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with this administration,” Leavitt said. It is illegal under international law to use the threat of force for diplomatic ends. On Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with Fox News after a round of indirect talks in Geneva that “​​it was very clear that the president has set some red lines  that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.” Iran has threatened to retaliate if the U.S. launched unprovoked strikes by targetingU.S. The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RFK Jr ally Jay Bhattacharya was named acting director of the CDC and will be fourth leader in a year to head agency Bhattacharya may sign off on further changes to the vaccine schedule, observers said. Bhattacharya will continue serving in his current role as NIH director, where he has overseen dramatic cuts to research and staff. The CDC has similarly slashed grants to states and enacted massive layoffs even as officials under Kennedy have dramatically reshaped policy on routine vaccinations. “Now, rather than largely ignoring the actual operations of one agency, he can largely ignore the actual operations of two,” he said. “It is a deep conflict of interest to have scientific funders like Fauci also closely involved with health policy,” he said in a May 2022 post criticizing Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He has also taken repeated aim at Francis Collins, a former NIH director. Mallory Harris, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Maryland who has followed Bhattacharya's public statements closely, noted that “ironically, since becoming NIH director he has been unusually involved in setting vaccine recommendations already and is now further consolidating his own power by taking on these roles simultaneously. “It seems the one qualification for this job is rubber-stamping RFK Jr's agenda. He has already proven himself very capable of doing so.” The HHS did not respond by press time to the Guardian's questions about how long Bhattacharya would serve as acting director and whether he would be able to lead two large agencies simultaneously. “My first reaction was: ‘I wonder if Jay will now do twice as many podcasts,'” Norton said. But his appointment as acting director could have lasting consequences, she added. Bhattacharya has been hands-off as NIH's leader, which “allows the administration to advance their agenda while having a figurehead that appears legitimate, at least on paper”, Norton said. “Bhattacharya's role for the administration is largely as a propagandist.” Most recently, Jim O'Neill served as acting director of CDC and deputy secretary at HHS before departing the health agencies on Friday; he was named director of the National Science Foundation on Wednesday. He can serve as “acting director” until 210 days have passed since Monarez left the job. Experts are concerned that Bhattacharya, who has been closely aligned with Kennedy's agenda, will advance new restrictions on vaccination, for instance. “They needed someone confirmed by the Senate who won't interfere,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at University of California Law San Francisco. Berg said: “Under normal circumstances, one would have thought that being NIH director was more than a full-time job, and then being an acting director of CDC would be another full-time job.” But he offered little confidence in Bhattacharya's ability to manage either. “I think he's safely locked up the position of worst NIH director in history. The agency has lost people and is barely functioning,” Berg said. “He's absolutely obsessed with Covid and the pandemic response,” Berg said. He also regularly criticized former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, saying she “epitomized politicized science”. When Bhattacharya was first appointed, Berg thought he seemed sincere in his desire to lead the massive agency, which is a leading research organization globally.</p>

Venezuelan billionaire Julio Herrera Velutini was indicted in 2022 for violating federal bribery laws related to illegal donations he made to a candidate in Puerto Rico's gubernatorial elections. After Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Velutini's daughter, Isabela Herrera, began making donations to MAGA Inc. The complaint notes that “making large donations to Trump's political network, which includes MAGA Inc. as his primary super PAC, has become a well-documented tactic for those seeking to obtain benefits, including favorable treatment by others facing civil and Notably, Velutini, a Venezuelan national, cannot legally make political donations like these himself. In August, the Department of Justice (DOJ) presented Velutini with a plea bargain deal, and in January, Trump issued him “a full and unconditional pardon.” “If so, billionaire Julio Herrera Velutini broke more than the laws meant to keep election spending transparent and voters informed: He also illegally sought to influence American politics as a foreign national.” The complaint doesn't allege Trump engaged in any illegal action. As president, the U.S. Constitution gives Trump unrestricted power to pardon anyone, save for individuals facing impeachment, without any oversight whatsoever. However, an inquiry into Velutini's and Herrera's donation scheme could uncover potential problems for Trump still if evidence shows that he issued the pardon because of the money that was given to MAGA Inc. While not technically illegal, it could still be deemed an impeachable offense by Congress. The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is moving to arrest thousands of people already legally admitted to the US as refugees and detain them indefinitely for aggressive “rescreening”, a report published on Thursday said. The DHS move is pertinent to an ongoing case in Minneapolis in which a federal judge last month blocked the Trump administration from further arrests of settled refugees in Minnesota, and ordered the release of at least 100 more arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Officials said “Operation Parris” (post-admission refugee reverification and integrity strengthening), which targeted about 5,600 refugees in Minnesota who had not yet become permanent residents, was “a sweeping initiative re-examining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims”. In his order, district court judge John Tunheim, who is scheduled to hear further arguments on Thursday in the class-action lawsuit brought by refugee groups, lambasted the detentions. Wednesday's DHS memo, also obtained by CNN, appears to directly contradict Tunheim's order, and claims existing “incomplete” guidance compels it to make arrests and detentions. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) plans to spend an estimated $38.3bn to buy and retrofit warehouses across the country as detention centers for tens of thousands of people, it was reported last week. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's approval rating over his handling of immigration issues dropped to a new low in February of 38%, down from 44% in December, a Quinnipiac poll found. It followed the January killings of US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents during protests against immigration enforcement in Minneapolis. The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization that provides legal and other support for detained Minnesota refugees and their families, called the government's move an “unprecedented reversal of decades-long interpretation of refugee law”. “Forcing refugees, who have already been stringently interrogated, to undergo further questioning was already an affront, but irrevocably breaking their trust by withdrawing the safety promised to them and placing them in physical custody displays a very low value of human life.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Commission of Fine Arts fast-tracked approval for President Donald Trump's East Wing renovation plans Thursday, bringing the president's quest for a new ballroom one step closer to reality. In a unusual move, the committee, an independent federal agency that advises the president and Congress on design plans for monuments, memorials, coins and federal buildings, voted unanimously not only to approve the concept as presented but to approve the final design, an unexpected acceleration of the approval process through this committee. The meeting, held virtually on Zoom, was not open to public, in-person comment, so the chairman summarized that much of the  concern was about what commenters felt was “illegal demolition,” “inappropriate scale” and lack of transparency around the project. The vote came just an hour after the committee swore in two new members: Trump's executive assistant, Chamberlain Harris — a 26-year-old without any extensive arts experience — and Pamela Hughes Patenaude, former deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration. Since last year, the president has been installing loyalists on the committee, after gutting the board completely in October as the East Wing demolition got underway. Newly installed commissioner Harris spoke in support of the project, saying the White House is the “greatest house in world. We want this to be the greatest ballroom in the world.” The East Wing renovation project also requires approval from the National Capital Planning Commission that is set to meet next on March 5. The commission is also comprised of Trump loyalists. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network. Scan the QR code to download the CNN app on Google Play.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oil prices jumped Thursday to their highest level in nearly seven months and investors snapped up safe havens like gold, as tensions between the United States and Iran continue to flare. Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 1.6%, to $71.49 per barrel. Oil prices extended gains after rising more than 4% Wednesday and posting their biggest single-day jump since October. US and Iranian envoys met in Geneva in recent days for negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday said Iranian negotiators did not acknowledge some of President Donald Trump's “red lines” in negotiations. The prospect of conflict in Iran has stoked nerves about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and a corresponding surge in oil prices. “The renewed geopolitical tension between the US and Iran is now clearly feeding into prices,” Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said in a note. Gold in recent weeks has traded more like a meme stock than a safe haven, with enormous volatility and swings in prices. US military prepared to strike Iran as early as this weekend, but Trump has yet to make a final call, sources say About 20 million barrels of oil flow through the strait every day, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which is equivalent to 20% of global oil consumption. “The latest move [in oil prices] signals a market strengthening an already notable geopolitical risk premium as the world's most important oil artery once again sits within striking distance of a conflict,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note. Iran in recent days said it partially closed the Strait of Hormuz for planned naval exercises, according to Iranian media. Markets tend to shrug off geopolitical tensions. However, that dynamic begins to shift when geopolitical conflict can directly impact the global oil market, which influences consumer prices and business decisions across the globe. Venezuela, for example, is not a significant enough player in the global oil market for the US' capture of Nicolás Maduro to cause market jitters. “In energy markets, probabilities matter, especially when the potential disruption involves a major oil producer and a critical global transit route,” Hathorn at Capital.com said. “Oil markets are starting to price in higher risk as Iran remains a major producer, and more importantly, sits at the heart of the Strait of Hormuz,” she said. “Even limited disruption or credible threats to shipping lanes could cause an immediate supply shock.” The Strait of Hormuz is key to Iran's oil exports, and disruption to the flow of oil would hamper Iran's exporting business in addition to countries like China that source much of their oil from Iran. The prospect of conflict in Iran raises fears about shocks to oil supply, which could send prices soaring. “More immediately, strikes on Iran would risk causing oil prices to jump and threaten to boost inflation in much of the world, reducing the pace or number of interest rate cuts by major central banks,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note. US stocks opened lower Thursday morning. “Given that inflation and affordability are front and center for the White House right now, we'd have to think that protecting the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz is a priority, meaning that the priority is a diplomatic solution, and if that is not possible, then a military plan that protects the flow of oil as much as possible,” Dennis Follmer, chief investment officer at Montis Financial, said in a note. When conflict between Israel and Iran flared in June and the United States carried out strikes on Iran nuclear sites, oil prices jumped higher. Similarly, there were fears about Iran moving to close the Strait of Hormuz – but they never materialized. After the US' strikes and as conflict settled, oil prices turned lower.

MOSCOW, February 19. /TASS/. Special presidential envoy and CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev denied that Russia is offering the US projects worth $12 trillion "in exchange" for the lifting of sanctions.

"The Economist released a fake news story: Russia allegedly offers $12 trillion worth projects to the US 'in exchange' for sanctions lifting. This is not true. The lifting of sanctions will be eventually dictated by interests of the US proper: the US companies already lost over $300 bln when leaving the Russian market," he wrote on his channel in Max.

The Economist reported earlier also that many US lawyers are proactively studying possible scenarios of lifting sanctions on Russia, and the bulk of the preparatory work has already been completed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Washington lifts sanctions on Russia, the United States could gain access to joint projects with Moscow worth more than $14 trillion, Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said on Feb. 18. His remarks come amid growing scrutiny of a reported U.S.-Russia economic proposal tied to negotiations over ending the war in Ukraine, raising concerns in Kyiv about potential trade-offs. "The portfolio of potential U.S.-Russia projects is over $14 trillion." Dmitriev's comments responded to a reporting by the Economist, which said Moscow had floated projects worth roughly $12 trillion to Washington in exchange for lifting restrictions. According to the publication, proposals discussed during negotiations include granting individuals close to U.S. President Donald Trump stakes in Russian energy projects. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said there was "a lot of chatter" that Russia may have floated private business deals to U.S. officials, including envoy Steve Witkoff or members of Trump's family. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not deny it on Feb. 13, describing potential cooperation as a "natural extension" of shared economic interests. That Bloomberg reporting offered a detailed look at what Russia may be seeking. The outlet reported on Feb. 12 that Russia seeks to secure a wide-ranging economic partnership with the U.S. as part of an arrangement tied to Ukraine. Citing an internal Russian memo prepared earlier this year, the outlet said Moscow wants relief from restrictions that have cut it off from the dollar payment system. A return to dollar transactions would mark a reversal of Russia's recent "de-dollarization" policy, pursued in response to Western sanctions imposed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Tim is fluent in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. "The portfolio of potential U.S.-Russia projects is over $14 trillion," Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said. The reported move would limit Kyiv's role at a key gathering of NATO leaders. Russian forces are using LTE mobile networks and Ukrainian SIM cards to remotely control FPV drones, Serhii Beskrestnov, adviser to Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, said. Moldovan authorities said investigative measures began at 6 a.m. local time. Ukraine reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia's Pskov Oblast and launched missiles at the Russian city of Belgorod, causing power outages in parts of the city, Telegram news channels and local authorities reported overnight Feb. 18-19.

MOSCOW, February 19. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has commented on the ongoing Ukrainian conflict, highlighting continued US support through arms supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces.

"The US stance is truly complex," Zakharova stated. "On one hand, Donald Trump's administration inherited the Ukrainian conflict from the Biden administration. Kiev continues to receive US military aid. On the other hand, the current US leadership appears to be making efforts to seek solutions to the crisis - efforts that, notably, stem from the very situation Washington helped to instigate over a decade ago."</p>

The miner topped expectations, helped by rising copper prices and production.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Teck Resources TECK-B-T beat fourth-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, helped by a surge in copper prices and production, as the Canadian miner advanced its proposed merger with Anglo American NGLOY. The beat underscores Teck's growing leverage to copper, a metal central to electrification and energy transition demand, while the company works to complete a merger that would create one of the world's largest copper producers. Teck and Anglo first announced plans in September in a US$53-billion all-stock, nil-premium merger that would create the world's fifth-largest copper producer. “Copper production increased compared to the same period last year supported by higher throughput and grades at Highland Valley Copper, higher grades at Antamina, and higher throughput at Carmen de Andacollo,” the company said in a statement. The miner reported adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, above analysts' average estimate of 91 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG. Teck maintained its 2026 copper output outlook at 455,000 to 530,000 tons. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this episode of Sanchez Effect, we dive into the potential conflict map between Iran and the US, as Washington is basically camping out right at Iran's front door with a huge fleet, and threats are flying around like confetti. They're attempting to hash things out, but what if those talks go sideways? According to our guest military expert, the answer is yes – but not just for Tehran. Former US Army officer Stanislav Krapivnik points out that Russia and China are already sending signals by planning joint drills in Iran. They're not about to let Iran crumble. Iran didn't go all out then – it was hitting military bases, avoiding populated areas. But if this now escalates into full-blown war, it's a very different story. Israel is tiny, and most people live in a few big cities, so missing a target would be nearly impossible. No matter where the bombs land, they're ound to hit someone.

U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision after finding that the federal government failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.</p>

The statement added that police officers “are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk” and that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor “remains in police custody at this time.” It's not clear where he is being held. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who is the brother of King Charles III, has already been caught up in allegations that he had several liaisons with young girls arranged by Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019 in a New York prison, and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of child sex trafficking. The King has said that he would co-operate with any police probe. Former Prince Andrew should testify before U.S. Congress over Epstein ties, Starmer says Earlier on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed confidence that police would conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations. London's Metropolitan Police have also started a preliminary review into allegations surrounding Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor's protection officers and whether they turned a blind eye during visits to Mr. Epstein's private island where prosecutors say young girls had been trafficked for sex. In a recent statement the Met said it had yet to identify any illegal activity but added “initial enquiries into these specific allegations have begun so we can establish the facts.” The fall of a royal: from dashing prince to plain old Andrew Those files suggest that during his time as a trade envoy, Mr. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor passed on government information to the financier. “Attached is a confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province for International Investment Opportunities,” Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor wrote. In another e-mail sent Nov. 30, 2010, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor forwarded government “visit reports” on trips he'd made to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam. British government guidance says trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality regarding sensitive commercial information about their trips.

"Unfortunately, there's been another massive missile attack on energy facilities in the city of Belgorod. The city is located just 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia. Explosions and fires were reported overnight on Feb. 19 at an oil depot in the town of Velikiye Luki in northwestern Russia's Pskov Oblast, according to Telegram news channel Exilenova+. Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power as the Kremlin continues to wage its war against Ukraine. Kyiv considers energy infrastructure to be a military target as they directly fund Russia's war. Belgorod has repeatedly come under fire throughout the duration of Russia's full-scale war and in recent weeks. Drone attacks targeted several regions across Russia overnight on Feb. 17, including the Ilsky oil refinery in southern Russia's Krasnodar Krai, where a large fire broke out following reported strikes, according to Ukraine's General Staff, local authorities, and social media. Ukraine carried out strikes on an oil terminal in southern Russia and a Russian air defense system in occupied Crimea overnight on Feb. 14–15, according to Ukraine's military intelligence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The global artificial intelligence summit in New Delhi has been marred by an Indian university's claim that it developed a commercially-available Chinese robot. On Tuesday, a Galgotias University professor told state-backed broadcaster DD News that someone at the private institution had developed a mechanized dog, and displayed it at its stand at the AI Impact Summit. The university faced a backlash after internet users identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China's Unitree Robotics. “One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed,” the university said in a statement. “She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorized to speak to the press.” The institution's pavilion has reportedly been removed from the summit venue. Twenty world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as well as an array of technology company heads, are attending the summit. Google  CEO Sundar Pichai, Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and AMI Labs Executive Chairman Yann LeCun are all slated to attend the summit. The India AI Impact Summit is being envisaged by New Delhi as a platform to position the country as a global hub for artificial intelligence. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>
