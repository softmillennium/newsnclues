                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Anisimova ended Mirra Andreeva's title defense at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships in the quarterfinals, coming through a nailbiter in a third-set tiebreak. She will face Jessica Pegula, who defeated last year's finalist Clara Tauson in three sets, in an all-American semifinal. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva's Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships title defense 2-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) in a quarterfinal thriller, holding off a late charge from 5-3 down in the third set by the 18-year-old to convert her fourth match point after 2 hours and 38 minutes. 4 seed Jessica Pegula in an all-American semifinal, a reprise of last month's Australian Open quarterfinal tilt. 12 seed and last year's runner-up Clara Tauson 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 to reach her seventh consecutive semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, a streak that stretches back to last year's US Open. "It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis," Anisimova continued. "Seeing Mirra down like that, it's understandable. We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today. These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day." "It's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that," she said. "It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her. Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things." Anisimova's victory was her first Top 10 win of 2026, and marks the first time she has reached a semifinal since the 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh. Last year, she ended Andreeva's 13-match winning streak 7-6(5), 2-6, 6-3 in the Miami third round. Pegula has dominated their head-to-head so far with a perfect 4-0 record, including a 6-2, 7-6(1) win in Melbourne last month. Setting the stage for a third-set tug-of-war: As Andreeva advanced to a 6-2, 2-0 lead, the teenager's tactics and execution were both spot on. But with two points to go up a 3-0 double break, Andreeva threw in a pair of her own errors -- and a rejuvenated Anisimova cleaned up her accuracy to reel off five straight games and lead 5-2. Andreeva managed to rediscover her first-set form to level at 5-5, but lapsed into error again in the final game of the set. Anisimova expands her game to pull ahead: But getting tied up in that exchange seemed to only spur Anisimova on. She found her best sequence of no-holds-barred power hitting in response, and took five of the next seven games to lead 5-3. In this passage of play, Anisimova's willingness to come forwards proved crucial -- and she also pulled off a hot shot of her own, a one-handed backhand flick to finish a cat-and-mouse placement battle in the sixth game. Most impressively, Anisimova's adjustments were made on the fly. Net play had not been part of her advance strategy. "Before the match that wasn't really something in my mind," she said. "But as the match went on, she gets to every single ball. "It's something I've also tried to get better at and improve in. We were both trying to play really aggressive. With Anisimova serving at 5-3, Andreeva saved a match point by drawing the error with a short forehand slice. "When it was 5-5 I was like, damn, I had a match point at 5-3," Anisimova recalled in her press conference. "It was just a flying thought in my mind. I think Coco [Gauff] also saved a few match points last night. I ended up coming to watch that match in the end. I feel like the tennis here has been sort of a rollercoaster. That's also what makes this sport so enjoyable to watch. Embracing the wild shifts made possible by tennis's scoring system, Anisimova made one last charge -- and victory ultimately came down to her ability to tee off on the Andreeva second serve. Amanda Anisimova ended Mirra Andreeva's title defense at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships in the quarterfinals, coming through a nailbiter in a third-set tiebreak. She will face Jessica Pegula, who defeated last year's finalist Clara Tauson in three sets, in an all-American semifinal.</p>

Fritz had three match points, but couldn't capitalize on any. They were all on Shelton's serve—and to Fritz's credit, he returned each one and engaged in a rally—but painfully came up short.“When you get a tournament win like that,” said Gilbert of Shelton, “the next place that you go to…you get in a same situation, I'm going to find another win.”WATCH: Should Fritz, playing through injury, take some time off? “When you get a tournament win like that,” said Gilbert of Shelton, “the next place that you go to…you get in a same situation, I'm going to find another win.”WATCH: Should Fritz, playing through injury, take some time off?

While acknowledging the outsized length of the calendar, Gilbert also felt some players were retiring when they really didn't have to—and worse, playing shortly after.“There should be some sort of penalty for retiring, because you screwed the fans—you couldn't have been that bad, you played the next week,” said BG. “They need to look at that.”Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek (neither of whom retired last week) aren't playing this week in Dubai, a 1000-level tournament, nor are Doha finalists Muchova and Mboko.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flavio Cobolli, feeling like a superhero at the Delray Beach Open. Cobolli, who overcame Terence Atmane 7-5, 6-4, was quick to attribute his victory to the distinctive green character now inked into his right leg: The Hulk. "I feel like Hulk on the court now" 🤣💪🦸‍♂️ Italian superhero @cobollifla has a new tattoo to share...#DBOpen | 📍Delray Beach pic.twitter.com/mCCda4gmim Cobolli's shirt-shredding celebration that inspired the tattoo came after he saved seven match points and won a 32-point deciding-set tie-break to overcome Zizou Bergs and seal Italy a spot in November's Davis Cup Final, which the European country subsequently won. He showcased that sort of on-court grit again against Atmane on Wednesday by bouncing back from four consecutive defeats to set a quarter-final meeting with Coleman Wong, who defeated Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-6(4). “It's my first win [for a while], so I'm really happy to be in the middle of the court,” said Cobolli after levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Atmane at 1-1. “It was tough, the beginning of the year, but now I'm really happy to be here at this fantastic tournament. I lost to him last time with a great battle in Cincinnati. I practised well this week and felt comfortable staying on the court for a long time. In other action, second seed Casper Ruud fought off a stern test from Marcos Giron, defeating the American 4-6, 7-6(6), 6-4. Giron will rue being two points from victory at 6/6 in the second-set tie-break.
