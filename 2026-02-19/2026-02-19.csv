            Oil prices jumped Thursday to their highest level in nearly seven months and investors snapped up safe havens like gold, as tensions between the United States and Iran continue to flare.
    


            Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 1.6%, to $71.49 per barrel. US crude rose 1.74%, to $66.18 per barrel. Oil prices extended gains after rising more than 4% Wednesday and posting their biggest single-day jump since October.
    


            Gold, usually considered a haven amid uncertainty, rose 2% Wednesday and reclaimed $5,000 a troy ounce. Gold prices edged higher Thursday morning.
    


            US and Iranian envoys met in Geneva in recent days for negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday said Iranian negotiators did not acknowledge some of President Donald Trump's “red lines” in negotiations.
    


            The negotiations come as the United States has moved military assets closer to the Middle East. The prospect of conflict in Iran has stoked nerves about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and a corresponding surge in oil prices.
    


            “The renewed geopolitical tension between the US and Iran is now clearly feeding into prices,” Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said in a note.
    


            Gold in recent weeks has traded more like a meme stock than a safe haven, with enormous volatility and swings in prices. But the rising tensions in the Middle East sparked a fresh bid for haven assets, lifting the metal's price above the $5,000 threshold.
    


US military prepared to strike Iran as early as this weekend, but Trump has yet to make a final call, sources say



            When tensions are brewing between the United States and Iran, the spotlight turns to the Strait of Hormuz. The narrow waterway off the coast of Iran is a critical chokepoint for the flow of the global oil supply.
    


            About 20 million barrels of oil flow through the strait every day, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which is equivalent to 20% of global oil consumption.
    


            “The latest move [in oil prices] signals a market strengthening an already notable geopolitical risk premium as the world's most important oil artery once again sits within striking distance of a conflict,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.
    


            Iran in recent days said it partially closed the Strait of Hormuz for planned naval exercises, according to Iranian media.
    


What is the Strait of Hormuz and why is it so significant?



            Markets tend to shrug off geopolitical tensions. However, that dynamic begins to shift when geopolitical conflict can directly impact the global oil market, which influences consumer prices and business decisions across the globe.
    


            Venezuela, for example, is not a significant enough player in the global oil market for the US' capture of Nicolás Maduro to cause market jitters. But investors begin to grow wary with Iran, due to its proximity to the key chokepoint for the global market.
    


            “In energy markets, probabilities matter, especially when the potential disruption involves a major oil producer and a critical global transit route,” Hathorn at Capital.com said.
    


            “Oil markets are starting to price in higher risk as Iran remains a major producer, and more importantly, sits at the heart of the Strait of Hormuz,” she said. “Even limited disruption or credible threats to shipping lanes could cause an immediate supply shock.”
    


            The Strait of Hormuz is key to Iran's oil exports, and disruption to the flow of oil would hamper Iran's exporting business in addition to countries like China that source much of their oil from Iran.
    


            The prospect of conflict in Iran raises fears about shocks to oil supply, which could send prices soaring. Higher oil prices can raise consumer prices and contribute to inflation.
    


            “More immediately, strikes on Iran would risk causing oil prices to jump and threaten to boost inflation in much of the world, reducing the pace or number of interest rate cuts by major central banks,” analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note.
    


            US stocks opened lower Thursday morning. The Dow fell 164 points, or 0.33%. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.
    


            “Given that inflation and affordability are front and center for the White House right now, we'd have to think that protecting the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz is a priority, meaning that the priority is a diplomatic solution, and if that is not possible, then a military plan that protects the flow of oil as much as possible,” Dennis Follmer, chief investment officer at Montis Financial, said in a note.
    


            When conflict between Israel and Iran flared in June and the United States carried out strikes on Iran nuclear sites, oil prices jumped higher. Similarly, there were fears about Iran moving to close the Strait of Hormuz – but they never materialized. After the US' strikes and as conflict settled, oil prices turned lower.

            Amazon has surpassed Walmart as the world's largest company, measured by sales, breaking Walmart's 13-year streak at the top of the list.
    


            Amazon posted $717 billion in sales in 2025. Walmart, the largest company in the world for more than a decade, recorded $713 billion in sales in 2025, the retailer announced Thursday.
    


            Although the two companies are significant competitors in consumer retail, Amazon's revenue growth in cloud computing, advertising and other businesses helped it overtake Walmart.
    


            Jeff Bezos started Amazon in 1994 as an online bookstore, but the company brought in nearly $129 billion in sales last year from its Amazon Web Services division. AWS provides a vast network of computing, storage and artificial intelligence options to companies and governments around the world. AWS is also a key profit driver for Amazon and helps the company offset losses from its retail business.
    


            The majority ($464 billion) of Amazon's revenue last year came from sales on its online and physical stores as well as from third-party sellers. Amazon also brought in more than $100 billion combined from advertising and Prime subscriptions.
    


            By contrast, more than 90% of Walmart's sales come from its physical stores and websites.
    


            Despite Amazon's rapid rise, Walmart has adapted and is in its strongest shape in years. 



            Walmart's stock recently surpassed $1 trillion in value, the first traditional retailer to hit that mark. Walmart also moved its stock listing to the Nasdaq, signaling to investors it wants to be thought of as a tech company.
    


            Walmart's business in the United States is surging, led by middle-class and upper-income households turning to the retailer to try to save money. The retailer continues to gain market share from rivals like Target.
    


            Walmart, led by new CEO John Furner, said Thursday that US sales grew 4.6% last quarter.
    


            “The pace of change in retail is accelerating,” Furner said in a statement. “Our financial results show that we're not only embracing this change, we're leading it.”

The global artificial intelligence summit in New Delhi has been marred by an Indian university's claim that it developed a commercially-available Chinese robot.

On Tuesday, a Galgotias University professor told state-backed broadcaster DD News that someone at the private institution had developed a mechanized dog, and displayed it at its stand at the AI Impact Summit.

The university faced a backlash after internet users identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China's Unitree Robotics. It walked back the academic's claim and apologized for the confusion.

“One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed,” the university said in a statement. “She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorized to speak to the press.”

The institution's pavilion has reportedly been removed from the summit venue.

Twenty world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as well as an array of technology company heads, are attending the summit.



Google  CEO Sundar Pichai, Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and AMI Labs Executive Chairman Yann LeCun are all slated to attend the summit.

The India AI Impact Summit is being envisaged by New Delhi as a platform to position the country as a global hub for artificial intelligence.

In this episode of Sanchez Effect, we dive into the potential conflict map between Iran and the US, as Washington is basically camping out right at Iran's front door with a huge fleet, and threats are flying around like confetti. They're attempting to hash things out, but what if those talks go sideways? Trump keeps saying it'll be a bad day for Tehran if things escalate, but will it really? According to our guest military expert, the answer is yes – but not just for Tehran.

Former US Army officer Stanislav Krapivnik points out that Russia and China are already sending signals by planning joint drills in Iran. For Russia, Iran is the gateway to the Caucasus and Central Asia; while for China, it opens the doors to Central Asia and beyond. They're not about to let Iran crumble.

And remember last year's 12-day war? Iran didn't go all out then – it was hitting military bases, avoiding populated areas. But if this now escalates into full-blown war, it's a very different story. Israel is tiny, and most people live in a few big cities, so missing a target would be nearly impossible. No matter where the bombs land, they're ound to hit someone. What else could happen? We're covering everything – weapons, ships, missiles and more – in this latest episode, only on RT.

MOSCOW, February 19. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky will be forced to resign if Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, gathers sufficient evidence of his direct involvement in corruption schemes, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov, who served from 2010 to 2014, said in an interview with TASS.

He noted that Zelensky's current position prevents investigators from involving him in the probe at this stage.

""If NABU detectives obtain enough evidence to prove Zelensky's direct involvement, which they likely already have or will soon have, then the Americans will probably give the green light, and he will have no choice but to resign,"" Azarov said.

He expressed confidence that NABU would continue efforts to expose Zelensky and his entourage. ""The process will go on. We see that it is not stopping,"" he added.

On November 10, 2025, NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced an investigation into a major corruption scheme in the energy sector, dubbed Operation Midas. According to investigators, participants in the scheme laundered around $100 million. Zelensky's close friend, businessman Timur Mindich, was identified as the coordinator of the schemes. He left the country several hours before searches began.

Publication of the case materials led to the resignation of several ministers, including German Galushchenko, who previously headed the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Justice, as well as the dismissal of the head of Zelensky's office and his associate Andrey Yermak. The developments temporarily paralyzed the work of parliament. Reports also indicated that not all case materials had been made public, that new senior officials could be implicated, and that the investigation was not limited to the energy sector, with detectives also examining defense procurement.

On February 17, Ukraine's High Anti-Corruption Court remanded Galushchenko, charged with laundering funds from Energoatom, into custody, with the possibility of release on bail set at 200 million hryvnia, or $4.6 million.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

NEW YORK, February 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has not yet made a final decision regarding a strike on Iran, but the US military is ready to do so as early as this coming weekend, CNN reported, citing sources.

According to one source, the president ""has privately argued both for and against military action and polled advisers and allies on what the best course of action is."" A meeting on this topic involving high-ranking officials was reportedly held at the White House on February 18. Additionally, on the same day, US Presidential Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and entrepreneur Jared Kushner reported to Trump on ""their indirect talks with Iran,"" which took place on February 17.

Earlier, CBS News reported, citing sources, that the US administration is considering the possibility of striking Iran this weekend, but no final decision has been made yet.

Trump said on January 26 that a ""massive armada"" was heading toward Iran. He expressed hope that Tehran would return to the negotiating table and conclude a ""fair and equitable"" deal, implying a complete renunciation of nuclear weapons. In response, Tehran warned that any attack on Iran will entail threats to the United States and its allies' entire military infrastructure in the Middle East.

On February 17, the second round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the nuclear issue took place in Geneva, mediated by Oman. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached mutual understanding on a number of issues, agreements on which could be included in a draft future agreement on the nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of aspects, but Tehran is not yet ready to accept some of the fundamental positions outlined by the White House. The parties have not disclosed the time and place of the next round of talks.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Tehran may claim it will not negotiate under duress, but that is precisely what it is being required to do

Although much attention will be given to the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, it is the “arsenal of war” that Donald Trump has assembled in the Middle East, and what it implies for the stately pace of Washington's negotiations with Iran, that deserves more.

The well-connected Axios reporter Barak Ravid is hated in Iran – one news site on Thursday described him as a one-man psychological war operation against Tehran. But he is widely read, as was his report that the US viewed the talks in Geneva on Tuesday as a “nothing burger”, and that a full-scale attack on Iran was far closer than most Americans realised. The story led to a spike in oil prices and front-page pieces in US newspapers saying Trump's military preparations would be complete by the weekend, with the president hinting a decision would be made “probably over the next 10 days”.

Inevitably this, along with the armada, could be seen as another part of coercive diplomacy. The Trump team's modus operandi often seems to be to “speak softly [to Axios] and carry a big stick”.

Either way, Iran may claim it will not negotiate under duress – but that is precisely what it is being required to do.

It has prompted the Iranian diplomatic class to push back against the claim that it is playing for time by insisting on indirect talks and drafting “guiding principles” to be discussed at another meeting in a fortnight – or that the talks have not moved beyond generalities.

The Iranian foreign ministry said that, on the contrary, Tehran's team had been willing to stay in Geneva for days to continue the discussions but it had been Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had foreshortened the talks because they needed to go to another venue to negotiate with Ukraine and Russia.

For good measure Tehran pointed out that the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had been on the phone to the UN nuclear weapons inspector, Raphael Grossi, to discuss details of how the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be able to visit Iran's nuclear sites to verify what remained and to oversee the dilution of its 400kg stockpile of uranium, now enriched to more than 60%.

Grossi sounded optimistic. “There has been some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done, and the problem is that we don't have much time,” he said. “It's possible to have a dialogue that is really strengthening for the first time … We're talking about specific issues and actions that we need to take.”

He said he sensed a desire on both sides to reach an agreement, but that doing so would be “extremely complex”.

The outlines of the agreement are in view, even if Iran, still behaving as if it were involved in a traditional negotiation, is reluctant to spell out in public what concessions it is prepared to make.

Its offer at heart is to suspend domestic uranium enrichment for a fixed period as long as five years, and downgrade its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% to 3-6%. The 2015 nuclear agreement required a 15-year suspension, and for Iran to keep its uranium stockpile under 300kg enriched to a maximum of 3.67%.

The suspension offer is in part an acknowledgment of the reality that Tehran currently has working centrifuges to enrich uranium, and it would insist on retaining its right to enrich for civilian purposes as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

Iran is prepared to allow the IAEA back, even though it feels Grossi betrayed the agency's neutrality by never condemning the US attacks on its nuclear facilities, despite their being under IAEA safeguards at the time.

In an interview in Saudi Arabia, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said: “I am convinced that if the normal work of IAEA inspectors, as mandated by its founding documents, is restored, the Iranian side will certainly cooperate with them.” He made no mention of Iran's excess stockpile being sent to Russia, an offer Moscow has frequently made.

In return for suspension, Tehran is seeking the return of its frozen assets – estimates vary on the size – and the lifting of sanctions on banking and oil exports. A grand offer of a US economic partnership and wider access to Iranian markets has also been made, which could be the most novel part of the draft agreement and is loosely modelled on what Ukraine has offered the US.

Trump's difficulty in running with Iran's offer is threefold. It bears a striking resemblance to the 2015 nuclear deal that he derided and abandoned in 2018. It allows Tehran in principle to enrich domestically, and it contains nothing about limiting the range of its ballistic missile programme, a key Israeli demand. It would look as if he was repairing the wreckage he caused in his first term.

Second, he would be giving succour to an Iranian regime that is at its weakest and most unpopular since the 1979 revolution, after assembling the largest US naval buildup in the Middle East since the start of the Iraq war in 2003.

Third, he would make the Grand Old Duke of York look decisive, and after the Greenland fiasco his credibility is low.

Omid Memarian, a senior Iran analyst at Dawn, a Washington thinktank focused on the Middle East, said Tehran was overplaying its cards and was not in as strong a position as last June.

“The calculus of the military establishment is very different to ordinary Iranians,” he said. “They have a legitimacy crisis and lost a massive amount of their ability to deter outside attacks, but they think a US attack will rally their loyalists around the flag as it did last June, and that will give them an excuse to deal harshly with internal dissent. That is why they are giving so little in the negotiations.

“They know this is going to be an existential threat and a much bigger US attack, but they do not think it can bring the regime to its knees, and that they can survive it.

“Ali Khamenei's tactics are to keep the base intact and energised, but we are starting to see cracks in the regime, and an external attack may provide more space for those criticising the regime in which to move. There is a lot of frustration with him amongst his inner circle.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President says US has ‘some work' to do with Iran as representatives from more than 45 countries attend Trump-run initiative

Authoritarians, strongmen and dictators: who is on Trump's Board of Peace?

On Iran, Donald Trump praised Steve Witkoff's diplomatic efforts with the Republic. “Iran is a hot spot right now,” Trump said, noting that both Witkoff and Jared Kushner – another envoy and the president's son-in-law – have a good relationship with the representatives Iran. “Good talks are being had. It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise, bad things happen, but we have to make a meaningful deal,” Trump said.

He added:

double quotation markWe do have some work to do with Iran. They can't have a nuclear weapons. Very simple. You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon.

Trump continued to keep the cards of any possible military action close to his chest. “We may have to take it a step further, or we may not, maybe we're going to make a deal,” he said. “You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”

In response to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest today, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, Robert Garcia, said that it is “an enormous step forward in our fight to secure justice” for the Jeffrey Epstein's survivors.

In November, oversight Democrats called for the former prince to sit for questioning as part of their ongoing investigation into the handling of the Epstein case. “Britain is now holding him accountable with this arrest. Now it's time for the United States to end this White House cover-up,” Garcia added in a statement.

Other Democratic members of Congress welcomed the news of Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest, and how it might impact accountability stateside.

“Even princes are not above the law,” said congressman Ro Khanna, who led the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. “But why isn't more being done here? We should start with Howard Lutnick resigning,” he added, referring to Donald Trump's commerce secretary – who admitted that he visited Epstein on his private island in 2012, four years after the disgraced financier was convicted on state charges of soliciting prostitution. This, despite Lutnick's claims that he was no longer in touch with Epstein after 2005.

Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was named the acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday, making him the fourth leader in a year at the embattled agency in an unprecedented move that further consolidates power among a small group of men at the helm of US health agencies.

He's been an ineffectual health leader whose attention will be further fractured, and as a close ally to Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime vaccine critic. Bhattacharya may sign off on further changes to the vaccine schedule, observers said.

Bhattacharya will continue serving in his current role as NIH director, where he has overseen dramatic cuts to research and staff. The CDC has similarly slashed grants to states and enacted massive layoffs even as officials under Kennedy have dramatically reshaped policy on routine vaccinations.

Staff say the controversial health economist has had little to do with the daily operations of the NIH.

“He won't actually run the CDC. Just as he doesn't actually run NIH,” said Jenna Norton, an NIH program officer speaking in her personal capacity.

Jeremy Berg, former director of National Institute of General Medical Sciences, had a similar response. “Now, rather than largely ignoring the actual operations of one agency, he can largely ignore the actual operations of two,” he said.

Bhattacharya, who made a name opposing measures to prevent Covid-19, has strongly criticized officials who fund research and advise on policy simultaneously.

“Bureaucrats who fund the careers of scientists should play no role whatsoever in setting pandemic policy,” Bhattacharya wrote in a post on Twitter/X in December 2021, saying the “dual role” was a conflict of interest that silenced scientists.

Edi Rama, the prime minister of Albania, refuted claims from Nato allies that the Board of Peace would undermine the authority of the United Nations.

“It does not look to me like an attempt to replace the UN,” Rama said. “But if it helps shake that agonizing giant then inshallah, wake it up.”

Attending today's event is former British prime minister Tony Blair, who extolled Donald Trump's so-called 20-point peace plan for Gaza.

“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace, not a phoney piece of declarations no one means, and agreements no one intends to keep,” Blair said.

“Whether you're a Muslim, Jew, Christian, of any faith or none – you can rise by your own efforts and feel your government by your side, not on your back. That is the vision behind President Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza, and it remains the best, indeed the only hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world.”

Donald Trump noted today that his Board of Peace plans to work with the United Nations (UN) “very closely” moving forward. This comes as several ally countries – including the Vatican – have eschewed joining the board because it could usurp the UN's power.

“I think the United Nations has great potential, really great potential,” Trump said. “The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly.”

The president noted that if the UN needs help “money wise”, the Board of Peace is prepared to step in.

Donald Trump said the United States will contribute $10bn to his Board of Peace. A reminder, that the president said over the weekend that member states have pledged $5bn to be a part of the board.

“When you look at that compared to the cost of war, that's two weeks of fighting, it's a very small number. It sounds like a lot, but it's a very small number,” Trump said, a nod to the emerging chorus of frustration at the administration's substantial involvement in foreign policy.

The president offered no details about how the US would send this money to the board, or if he's requested approval from Congress for the funds.

On Iran, Donald Trump praised Steve Witkoff's diplomatic efforts with the Republic. “Iran is a hot spot right now,” Trump said, noting that both Witkoff and Jared Kushner – another envoy and the president's son-in-law – have a good relationship with the representatives Iran. “Good talks are being had. It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise, bad things happen, but we have to make a meaningful deal,” Trump said.

He added:

double quotation markWe do have some work to do with Iran. They can't have a nuclear weapons. Very simple. You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon.

Trump continued to keep the cards of any possible military action close to his chest. “We may have to take it a step further, or we may not, maybe we're going to make a deal,” he said. “You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”

Trump has spent most of his remarks, so far, touting his self-perceived achievements, with little explanation on how the Board of Peace actually plans to function.

On the war in Gaza, Trump declares it “over” barring “little flames” in the region. “The cease fire was held, and every last remaining hostage, both living and dead, has been returned back home. Think of that,” Trump added.

Reporting from Washington

Donald Trump has endorsed Hungary's Viktor Orbán ahead of parliamentary elections in which the illiberal European leader could be pushed out of office after 16 years in power.

Nodding to criticisms that endorsing foreign leaders would amount to elections interference, Trump said: “I'm not supposed to be endorsing people, but I endorse when I like people. You know, I've had a very good record of endorsing candidates within the United States, but now I endorse foreign leaders, including Viktor Orbán.”

Trump said that his support for Argentina's Javier Milei, another attendee of the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, had also helped his party in recent elections.

“He was a little behind in the polls,” Trump added. “He ended up winning in a landslide.”

Turning back to Orban, he said: “Prime Minister Orban of Hungary … has my complete and total endorsement for election. Not everybody in Europe loves that endorsement. That's OK. He does an unbelievable job. He's done an incredible job on immigration. Unlike some countries that have hurt themselves, they're working on it,” Trump said.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio had previously suggested that the US would provide Hungary with financial support and an extension of sanctions relief on purchasing Russian gas and oil for as long as the conservative leader is in power.

Few details so far on how Trump plans to solve the conflict in Gaza or begin the reconstruction of the wartorn region.

Trump kicked off his remarks with his misleading claim that he's ended eight wars. He notes that the conflict in Ukraine continues to evade him.

As he welcomes member states today, he says “there's never been anything close” to this level of prestige when it comes to the Board of Peace. He notes that some countries – namely Nato allies – are “playing a little cute”, by deciding to not join the Trump-led board.

Reporting from Washington

Donald Trump's inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace is off to a late start. World leaders and delegates mainly from the Middle East and Asia are gathered for a family photo before the speeches begin at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace. Trump enters the room and exchanges a few words with Viktor Orbán, a rightwing ally and a rare European leader who has chosen to attend the event. US Nato allies have chosen not to join the organisation and send observers instead, with some saying the Board of Peace undermines other international organisations like the United Nations. Trump then exchanges handshakes with a number of autocrats including Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev, as well as rightwing allies like Argentina's Javier Milei.

US speakers include Trump, secretary of state Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz. JD Vance is there for the photo but is not scheduled to speak.

The speaking list is dominated by Gulf countries, with representatives for Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar all set to speak, as well as the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the foreign minister of Turkey and the president of Romania.

Also somewhat surprisingly delegates will see a video presentation by Fifa. Though that may not be surprising given Fifa president Gianni Infantino's close relationship with Trump.

“I think we have to smile,” Trump says. “A lot of good people.”

“Does everybody like the music? It's good music.”

We're just moments away.

As we wait for the Board of Peace event to begin, my colleague Jakub Krupa notes that Italy, Poland, Czech Republic and Romania are among more than a dozen of countries sending senior officials to the meeting, but only Hungary is actually expected to be part of the board as a member. This comes as several key European allies, as well as the Vatican, snubbed the US' invitation to join the board.

Congressmen Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie plan to introduce a war powers resolution next week, and try to force a vote on the House floor, to curb the Trump administration's possible military action against Iran.

“Trump officials say there's a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can't without Congress,” said Khanna, a California Democrat, amid the reports that the US is positioning aircraft carriers and amassing a large arsenal of fighter jets for a potential strikes.

He's teamed up with Republican Massie – whom he worked with to push the Epstein Files Transparency Act on to the House floor – on the legislation.

“I first got into politics to end the Iraq War. I won't let Trump launch a disastrous war without Congress voting to stop it,” Khanna added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

José María Balcázar, who argued for marriage at 14 and above, replaces José Jerí who was voted out after a scandal

Peru's congress has elected José María Balcázar, an octogenarian leftist lawmaker who has defended child marriage, as the country's interim president ahead of general elections in April.

Balcázar is Peru's ninth president since 2016. The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakers voted to remove José Jerí as president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal over secretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.

Balcázar, from the leftist Peru Libre party, was sworn in as Peru's head of congress on Wednesday after a four-hour session in which none of the four candidates managed to get a simple majority and lawmakers voted to elect Balcázar over Alva in a second round of voting.

Balcázar's election prompted finger pointing and recriminations among rightwing parties, as well as praise from sectors of the Peruvian political left.

Balcázar's previous remarks expressing approval of sexual relations between girls aged 14 and male teachers have dominated Peruvian news coverage after his unexpected election.

In 2023, the former regional high court judge sparked controversy as the only lawmaker to criticise and vote against a measure to ban child marriage. He said the ban should be limited to those under 14 only.

“From the age of 14 onwards, there should be no impediment; everyone has sexual relations, [male] teachers with pupils, female teachers with pupils, and between pupils too. That's fine,” he told journalists after the vote in congress. He later said his remarks had been taken out of context.

As the chair of the congressional education committee, he said it was common for teachers to have sex with their students, even saying the relations could be “beneficial” for the minor.

In a statement at the time, Peru's women's ministry strongly criticised his remarks as justifying “sexual violence against school-age children and adolescents, a painful and despicable situation that profoundly affects their overall wellbeing and fundamental rights”.

When questioned about those remarks in an interview for a national radio broadcaster on Thursday, Balcázar replied: “I will not change my mind, I am firm in my convictions.”

In addition, Balcázar has been investigated for allegedly embezzling funds when he was head of the bar association in his native region of Lambayeque. He was expelled from the association in 2022 after a disciplinary hearing.

Balcázar has gone on the record as saying he would release the jailed former leftist leader Pedro Castillo, who was sentenced by Peru's supreme court in November to 11 years, five months and 15 days in prison for trying to disband congress and rule by decree in December 2022.

Balcázar is expected to preside over the country until 28 July, when a new president takes office. Peruvians will head to the polls on 12 April and a run-off vote is expected in June.

Amid fears that Balcázar could exceed his role in leading the country to the elections, pro-democracy, business and rights organisations called for restraint.

Álvaro Henzler, of the pro-democracy nonprofit group Transparencia Perú, said: “Out of respect for the stability of the country and in view of an exhausted citizenry, the new president's mandate must be strictly limited to ensuring a transparent and orderly democratic transition and preventing a worsening of the institutional crisis we are currently experiencing.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Any effort to isolate Taiwan would amount to a “global catastrophe” with economic, strategic and moral consequences, former US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi said at The World Forum in Berlin yesterday, as she called on democracies to act in concert to deter authoritarian expansion.

Speaking via video link, Pelosi said that Ukraine and Taiwan are “two chapters of the same story,” with authoritarian regimes testing whether the international community will allow the global order to be changed by force and freedom to be suppressed through intimidation.

As a vibrant democracy and a key engine of the global economy, Taiwan's very existence refutes the claim that freedom is incompatible with Chinese culture, she said.

Any attempt to isolate, coerce or invade Taiwan, would not simply be a regional issue, but would trigger a global catastrophe — economically, strategically and morally, she said.

Pelosi urged people not to look the other way in the face of aggression, adding that deterrence should not be mistaken for provocation and that the goal of defending Taiwan is to prevent conflict, not invite it.

Democracies will endure only if they act decisively and in unison, guided by clear moral conviction, she said.

The World Forum, organized by the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation focuses on issues including democracy, peace and global security.

This year, the forum featured a Taiwan workshop, bringing together lawmakers from Europe and the US, as well as representatives of civil society groups, to examine Taiwan's role in global security.

Meta Platforms Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg yesterday said that he regretted the company's slow progress in identifying underage users on Instagram, as he faced stinging criticism at a landmark social media trial over accusations that his company deliberately hooked children.

Asked to comment on complaints from inside the company that not enough was being done to verify whether children under 13 were using the platform, the 41-year-old head of Meta, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, said improvements had been made.

However, “I always wish that we could have gotten there sooner,” he added.

Zuckerberg was the most hotly anticipated witness in the California trial, the first in a series of lawsuits filed by American families against social media platforms.

The trial marked the first time the multibillionaire addressed the safety of his world-dominating platforms directly before a jury and under oath.

Zuckerberg was very reserved at first, an Agence France-Presse journalist in the courtroom reported. However, he grew animated, showing signs of annoyance, shaking his head and waving his hands as he turned toward the jury.

The 12 jurors in Los Angeles heard the increasingly testy testimony, as plaintiff lawyer Mark Lanier pressed Zuckerberg on age verification and the tycoon's guiding philosophy for making decisions at the vast social media company he controls.

During questioning by his own lawyers, a more relaxed Zuckerberg described time spent on the app as a “side effect” of a quality experience and often addressed the jurors directly to emphasize his points.

He also stressed his belief that Apple and Google, the companies behind operating systems powering most of the world's smartphones, should arrange for age verification at the handset level instead of leaving it to each app.

“Doing it at the level of the phone is just a lot clearer than having every single app out there have to do this separately,” Zuckerberg said.

“It would be pretty easy for them,” he added.

Zuckerberg faced a barrage of internal e-mails, including warnings from colleagues that age verification was not fit for purpose and others that seemed to plainly display that encouraging more time spent on Instagram was long a central goal of the company.

The trial is set to last until late next month, when the jury is to decide whether Meta, as well as Google-owned YouTube, bear responsibility for the mental health problems suffered by Kaley G.M., a 20-year-old California resident who has been a heavy social media user since childhood.

Kaley G.M. started using YouTube at age six, Instagram at nine, then TikTok and Snapchat.

Under-13s are not allowed on Instagram, and Lanier pressed Zuckerberg on the fact that Kaley had easily signed up for the platform.

Zuckerberg was confronted with an internal document that said Instagram had 4 million users under 13 in 2015, at the time the plaintiff adopted the app, and that 30 percent of all children aged 10 to 12, or “tweens,” in the US were users.

Zuckerberg said that “we're in the right place now” when it comes to age verification.

Lanier said that young people like Kaley were subject to Meta's efforts to increase time spent on its wildly popular apps, despite Zuckerberg having told the US Congress under oath that this was not the case.

Faced with e-mails displaying internal targets for usage, Zuckerberg said that “we used to have goals around time,” but that the company's aim was always to “build useful services” that connected people.

Zuckerberg was also read an old e-mail from former head of public policy Nick Clegg that said “the fact that we say we don't allow under-13s on our platform, yet have no way of enforcing it, is just indefensible.”

The trial is set to determine whether Google and Meta deliberately designed their platforms to encourage compulsive use among young people, damaging their mental health in the process.

The case is expected to establish a standard for resolving thousands of lawsuits that blame social media for fueling an epidemic of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and suicide among young people.

TikTok and Snapchat, also named in the complaint, reached settlements with the plaintiff before the trial began.

Domestic media reported a few flights had resumed operating by afternoon from the airport in Wellington, the capital, although cancelations were still widespread after airport authorities said most morning flights were disrupted.
Air New Zealand said it hoped to resume services when conditions ease later yesterday, after it paused operations at Wellington, Napier and Palmerston North airports.

Duterte, who is embroiled in a bitter feud with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, was impeached last year only to see the country's Supreme Court throw the case out over procedural issues.
Her announcement comes just days before her father, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, begins a pretrial hearing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands over crimes against humanity allegedly committed as part of a brutal crackdown on drugs.

Editor's note: Feb. 19, 11:35 a.m. Kyiv time: This story has been updated with information obtained from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)

Ukraine reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia's Pskov Oblast and launched missiles at the Russian city of Belgorod, causing power outages in parts of the city, Telegram news channels and local authorities reported overnight Feb. 18-19.

""Unfortunately, there's been another massive missile attack on energy facilities in the city of Belgorod. There are major damages. We can see that there's a partial loss of electricity and heat, so we're currently investigating,"" Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed late on Feb. 18.

The city is located just 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia.

Explosions and fires were reported overnight on Feb. 19 at an oil depot in the town of Velikiye Luki in northwestern Russia's Pskov Oblast, according to Telegram news channel Exilenova+.

A source from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the attack on the oil depot in Velikiye Luki was the work of their ""Alpha"" UAV unit, which managed to make their way through the anti-drone nets spread over the facility.

""Such operations are an element of systematic weakening of the military potential of the Russian Federation,"" the SBU source wrote in a statement. 

Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power as the Kremlin continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

Kyiv considers energy infrastructure to be a military target as they directly fund Russia's war.

Belgorod has repeatedly come under fire throughout the duration of Russia's full-scale war and in recent weeks.

Strikes were reported overnight Feb. 2 in Russia's Belgorod Oblast, where officials claimed a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire in the city of Stary Oskol.

On Feb. 6, blackouts and heating outages were reported in Russia's Belgorod Oblast overnight following a reported missile attack that damaged key energy infrastructure. 

Additional blackouts and heating outages were reported in Belgorod on Feb. 7 after alleged attacks on a local thermal power plant and electrical substation.

Drone attacks targeted several regions across Russia overnight on Feb. 17, including the Ilsky oil refinery in southern Russia's Krasnodar Krai, where a large fire broke out following reported strikes, according to Ukraine's General Staff, local authorities, and social media.

Ukraine carried out strikes on an oil terminal in southern Russia and a Russian air defense system in occupied Crimea overnight on Feb. 14–15, according to Ukraine's military intelligence.

Russian forces are using LTE mobile networks and Ukrainian SIM cards to remotely control FPV drones, Serhii Beskrestnov, adviser to Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, said. 

Iranian Rear Admiral Hassan Maqsoudlou said the drills reflect both countries' focus on the regional situation.

Hungary and Slovakia announced on Feb. 18 that they are halting diesel exports to Ukraine, citing the suspension of Russian oil transit via the Druzhba pipeline as the trigger for the move.

The decision escalates tensions between Kyiv and two of the EU's most Russia-friendly governments, as Ukraine pushes European partners to curb purchases of Russian energy that help finance Moscow's war.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto directly accused Kyiv of deliberately endangering the country's energy security.

""President Volodymyr Zelensky has decided not to restart oil transit for political reasons, deliberately putting Hungary's energy supply at risk,"" he said, adding that shipments will not resume until transit through Druzhba is restored.

Szijjarto also warned that Hungary plays a key role in supplying Ukraine with energy resources.

""A large part of Ukraine's gas, electricity and diesel imports arrives through or from Hungary,"" he said.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said the Slovnaft oil refining company would stop all fuel exports to Ukraine, redirecting production to the domestic market. 

He added that Bratislava has requested clarification from Kyiv, with Slovakia's ambassador, Pavel Vizdal, sending a formal note to Ukrainian authorities.

Transit through the Druzhba pipeline has been halted since late January following Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, according to Ukrainian officials.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a photo last week showing the burning Druzhba after a rare Russian strike on the pipeline on Ukrainian territory. Kyiv has also targeted the pipeline on Russian territory as part of its broader campaign against Russia's energy sector.

The Druzhba system, one of the world's largest oil pipelines with a capacity of around 2 million barrels per day, remains a key supply route for Hungary and Slovakia — the only EU countries still importing Russian crude via the network.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","Russia publicly pitches $14 trillion economic deal to Trump tied to lifting US sanctions","https://kyivindependent.com/russia-publicly-pitches-14-trillion-economic-deal-to-trump-tied-to-lifting-sanctions/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 13:21:31 GMT","

If Washington lifts sanctions on Russia, the United States could gain access to joint projects with Moscow worth more than $14 trillion, Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said on Feb. 18.

His remarks come amid growing scrutiny of a reported U.S.-Russia economic proposal tied to negotiations over ending the war in Ukraine, raising concerns in Kyiv about potential trade-offs.

""The U.S. will eventually lift sanctions because sanctions on Russia cost U.S. businesses $300+ billion,"" Dmitriev said. ""The portfolio of potential U.S.-Russia projects is over $14 trillion.""

Dmitriev's comments responded to a reporting by the Economist, which said Moscow had floated projects worth roughly $12 trillion to Washington in exchange for lifting restrictions.

According to the publication, proposals discussed during negotiations include granting individuals close to U.S. President Donald Trump stakes in Russian energy projects.

There has been no confirmation of the claims, but the reported proposal has drawn concern in Washington.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said there was ""a lot of chatter"" that Russia may have floated private business deals to U.S. officials, including envoy Steve Witkoff or members of Trump's family.

""If that proves to be true, obviously that is horrifying misconduct on their part,"" Whitehouse told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 18, adding that such claims would warrant investigation.

President Volodymyr Zelensky first revealed the existence of what Kyiv calls the ""Dmitriev package"" on Feb. 6. The White House twice declined to confirm the proposal to the Kyiv Independent.

Russia has signaled the proposal exists. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not deny it on Feb. 13, describing potential cooperation as a ""natural extension"" of shared economic interests.

That Bloomberg reporting offered a detailed look at what Russia may be seeking.

The outlet reported on Feb. 12 that Russia seeks to secure a wide-ranging economic partnership with the U.S. as part of an arrangement tied to Ukraine.

Citing an internal Russian memo prepared earlier this year, the outlet said Moscow wants relief from restrictions that have cut it off from the dollar payment system.

A return to dollar transactions would mark a reversal of Russia's recent ""de-dollarization"" policy, pursued in response to Western sanctions imposed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The package also includes procurement of ammunition and ""expansion of cooperation... on long-range drones.""

""The portfolio of potential U.S.-Russia projects is over $14 trillion,"" Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said.

The reported move would limit Kyiv's role at a key gathering of NATO leaders.

Russian forces are using LTE mobile networks and Ukrainian SIM cards to remotely control FPV drones, Serhii Beskrestnov, adviser to Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, said. 

Iranian Rear Admiral Hassan Maqsoudlou said the drills reflect both countries' focus on the regional situation.

Russia launched 37 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said, of which Ukrainian air defenses intercepted or jammed 29.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly prince Andrew, has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to his long-standing friendship with U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In a statement Thursday, Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright of the Thames Valley Police said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.”

The statement added that police officers “are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk” and that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor “remains in police custody at this time.” It's not clear where he is being held.

How the former prince Andrew fell from the Queen's favourite son to a royal headache

Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who is the brother of King Charles III, has already been caught up in allegations that he had several liaisons with young girls arranged by Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019 in a New York prison, and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of child sex trafficking. 

Thames Valley Police have been examining Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor's conduct as a British trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 and whether he gave Mr. Epstein access to government files. The former prince has denied the allegations.

The Thames Valley Police said it was “assessing” reports that the former Prince Andrew sent trade reports to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2010.

The Associated Press

Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, recently moved to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk from Windsor on the orders of the King. The one-time Duke of York is currently living in a five-bedroom farmhouse on the estate. The King has said that he would co-operate with any police probe. 

In a statement Thursday, the King said he “learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.”

Former Prince Andrew should testify before U.S. Congress over Epstein ties, Starmer says

“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: The law must take its course.”

Earlier on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed confidence that police would conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations. “They will conduct their own investigations, but one of the core principles in our system is that everybody is equal under the law and nobody is above the law,” he told the BBC.

London's Metropolitan Police have also started a preliminary review into allegations surrounding Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor's protection officers and whether they turned a blind eye during visits to Mr. Epstein's private island where prosecutors say young girls had been trafficked for sex. 

In a recent statement the Met said it had yet to identify any illegal activity but added “initial enquiries into these specific allegations have begun so we can establish the facts.”

The fall of a royal: from dashing prince to plain old Andrew

While Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor's connections to Mr. Epstein have been well-known for years, the extent of their relationship only came to light from the recent release of more than three million e-mails, photographs, text messages and other documents by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

Those files suggest that during his time as a trade envoy, Mr. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor passed on government information to the financier.

In one e-mail dated Dec. 24, 2010, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor forwarded Mr. Epstein a copy of a brief on business opportunities in Afghanistan. 

“Attached is a confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province for International Investment Opportunities,” Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor wrote. He added; “I am going to offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi) but would be very interested in your comments, views or ideas as to whom I could also usefully show this to attract some interest.”

In another e-mail sent Nov. 30, 2010, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor forwarded government “visit reports” on trips he'd made to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam. The reports also contained confidential details of investment opportunities.

British government guidance says trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality regarding sensitive commercial information about their trips.

Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk's campaign to bring his Starlink internet service to the country of his birth, South Africa, has ignited a furor across the country, provoking strong support from some factions and fierce opposition from others.

Just north of the border, however, Mr. Musk and his SpaceX satellite company have found success in an unexpected market: Zimbabwe.

In a country where the long-ruling regime is quick to blame U.S. policies for its economic woes, the American tycoon has seen his satellite service expanding rapidly in schools, offices, homes and even taxi cabs. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans have joined Starlink's 10 million global users.

The sharply contrasting outcome in the two African countries has exposed how divisive Mr. Musk has become in his South African homeland – and how quickly his satellite offering can conquer a less-developed market.

Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit searches X platform's office, Musk summoned for hearing

Zimbabwe has been ruled for 46 years by ZANU-PF, the liberation party of former president Robert Mugabe and his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The party has been staunchly socialist for most of its history.

But despite Mr. Musk's close links to U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has maintained sanctions on Zimbabwe's top political leaders, the former liberation fighters of ZANU-PF have welcomed the internet service that the billionaire offers from his low-earth orbit satellites.

“Starlink is a revolutionary service which we have embraced as we are a party that acknowledges the importance of technology in the attainment of our goals,” ZANU-PF information director Farai Marapira told The Globe and Mail.

“Starlink has enabled affordable internet to be accessed in any part of our country, making our communications with our grassroots heightened in efficiency,” he said.

Starlink's sales in Zimbabwe are booming. Within a year of its 2024 launch in the country, it had more than 50,000 customers and was providing 80 per cent of Zimbabwe's use of international internet bandwidth.

Francis Chikwari, a businessman in Zimbabwe's construction sector, says he has saved money by paying US$50 monthly for unlimited internet on a Starlink unit that he shares with 15 families. “I know it's an American company, but what's wrong with that?” he asks.

The Zimbabwean government announced in January that it is distributing 8,000 Starlink units to schools across the country. State-controlled media portrayed it as a generous gift by the government, but local Starlink officials declined to say whether the company had donated the school units – an offer it has made to other African governments.

Perhaps the most visible use of Starlink is at a high-profile ride-hailing company, Tap & Go, which has installed the units in its entire fleet of cars, with satellite receivers perched on their roofs. The company is owned by Paul Tungwarara, a prominent local investor and ZANU-PF insider. It offers free Starlink internet to its passengers, who pay as little as US$2 for rides in the centre of Harare, the capital.

“Starlink has changed my life,” says Linet Chimhanda, a 29-year-old computer technician and regular Tap & Go customer. “I can ride a taxi and use their internet at any time – isn't that efficient?”

Across the border in South Africa, however, Starlink is much more controversial – and still not officially licensed to operate, although thousands of people have illegally hooked up to it.

South African farmers and rural residents have agitated for the government to approve Starlink. In their remote locations, no other internet providers are feasible. Some farmers, hobbled by poor cellphone signals, are obliged to drive several kilometres just to send an e-mail or get access to market data.

To sweeten its offer, Starlink says it would provide free connectivity to 5,000 South African schools. But this hasn't impressed the government. According to its legislation, any foreign telecommunications company must be at least 30 per cent owned by historically disadvantaged South Africans if it wants an operating licence.

Mr. Musk refuses to comply. He claims to be a victim of racial discrimination. “Starlink is not allowed to have an internet provider licence in South Africa for the sole reason that I am not Black,” he said last month. “This is not ok.”

Elon Musk merges SpaceX with xAI in record-setting deal valuing new company at $1.25-trillion

South Africa sometimes allows an “equity equivalent” investment as an alternative to a direct 30-per-cent ownership share in foreign companies. Under this arrangement, a company that invests in programs that benefit black South Africans – such as training or infrastructure – can be deemed to fulfill the ownership requirements. Some politicians argue that Starlink's offer of free internet to 5,000 schools could satisfy this goal, possibly with the help of a regulatory or legislative amendment.

But others are adamantly opposed, especially because Mr. Musk has been a vociferous critic of his former homeland.

“We'd be stupid to have that Starlink thing here,” said Songezo Zibi, a member of South Africa's parliament.

“Elon Musk has declared himself, through his actions, as an enemy of South Africa's constitutional order, and an enemy of social justice and redress for racial inequality,” Mr. Zibi said in a video posted on Mr. Musk's social-media platform, X.

“He uses misinformation and disinformation to spread lies in the United States that are damaging to South Africa, including the lie about ‘white genocide.' It would be dangerous to have Elon Musk own a technological ecosystem in South Africa.”

A firebrand left-wing politician, Julius Malema, goes even further. Mr. Malema, who leads one of South Africa's biggest political parties, alleges that Mr. Musk and other foreigners would use Starlink to destabilize the country. “They're coming to create regime change,” he said.

Teck Resources TECK-B-T beat fourth-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, helped by a surge in copper prices and production, as the Canadian miner advanced its proposed merger with Anglo American NGLOY.

The beat underscores Teck's growing leverage to copper, a metal central to electrification and energy transition demand, while the company works to complete a merger that would create one of the world's largest copper producers.

Teck and Anglo shareholders voted in favor of the merger in December, paving the way for the creation of a copper heavyweight and leaving regulatory approvals as the final hurdle.

Ottawa approves Anglo-Teck merger

Teck and Anglo first announced plans in September in a US$53-billion all-stock, nil-premium merger that would create the world's fifth-largest copper producer.

Both companies have undergone significant restructuring in recent years, driven in part by previous takeover attempts.

Teck said realized copper prices rose 22.5 per cent in the fourth-quarter to US$5.11 per pound, while production rose nearly 10 per cent to 134,000 tons.

“Copper production increased compared to the same period last year supported by higher throughput and grades at Highland Valley Copper, higher grades at Antamina, and higher throughput at Carmen de Andacollo,” the company said in a statement.

Production at the Quebrada Blanca (QB) mine in Chile improved as the company advanced development of its tailings management facility.

Copper output at QB was 55,400 tons in the fourth quarter, lower than the previous year, but the strongest quarterly performance of 2025.

The miner reported adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, above analysts' average estimate of 91 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Teck maintained its 2026 copper output outlook at 455,000 to 530,000 tons.

The White House said there are many ""reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran"" but that diplomacy is always the first option. It comes as the US rapidly builds up a military presence near Iran.

We're rounding up some of the major developments on US-Iran news here:

Iran held annual military drills with Russia on Thursday, including live-fire exercises in the Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz that state news agency IRNA said were aimed at ""upgrading operational coordination as well as exchange of military experiences."" 

The waters in question are crucial shipping lanes for access to Iran, Iraq and the Gulf region. 

The annual exercises were first launched in 2019 and have been conducted seven times since. 

This year the drills coincide with the US moving more naval assets into waters relatively close to Iran's coastline. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, was this week reported to be headed for the region. Its journey would be liable to take around three weeks.

Although neither sides' actions make conflict inevitable, both appear to be trying to project strength and the ability to deploy if necessary in the event of negotiations failing. 

Iran's theocracy has come under severe strain in the past 12 months, firstly amid a brief period of conflict with Israel last summer, punctuated by advanced US strikes on key sites for its nuclear program. More recently, in January this year, widespread public protests broke out and were violently repressed by authorities.

US President Donald Trump said in Washington on Thursday that ""interesting"" nuclear talks with Iran were underway in Geneva, brokered by Oman, and said he thought there could be progress by the end of next week. 

""It's proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran,"" Trump told the inaugural meeting of his 'Board of Peace' body. ""We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen."" 

He was speaking as the US moves military assets including an aircraft carrier into waters relatively close to Iran. 

Trump referred to the negotiations as ""good talks"" and spoke of ""very interesting"" meeting with Iranian officials as they entered their second day. But he also warned that Washington ""may have to take it a step further"" in the case of no agreement, saying ""You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.""

His comments came shortly after a warning to Iran from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Thursday said: ""If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine.""

The head of Iran's atomic energy agency on Thursday said that no country could deprive Tehran of its right to enrich nuclear fuel, after US President Donald Trump's latest hint of military action. 

""The basis of the nuclear industry is enrichtment. Whatever you want to do in the nuclear process, you need nuclear fuel,"" Mohammad Eslami said in a video published in Iranian media.

""Iran's nuclear program is proceeding according to the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and no country can depirve Iran of the right to peacefully benefit from this technology,"" Eslami said.

Iran has long insisted that its enrichment of uranium is for peaceful power-generating and other civilian purposes, a position met with severe sketpicism by Israel, the US and Europe. 

Trump had previously boasted that the country's nuclear weapons program had been ""completely and totally obliterated"" in strikes last summer by Israel and the US.

However, US and Israeli intelligence agencies and militaries and other sources less prone to exaggeration suggested far less long-lasting damage had in fact been done.

The US military has informed President Donald Trump that it is ready to strike Iran as soon as this weekend, US outlets CNN and CBS report. 

However, the US media reports say that Trump has not made a final decision on whether to attack Iran.

The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, along with nearly 80 aircraft, was around 700 kilometers (435 miles) off Iranian shores as of Sunday. A second aircraft carrier group, the USS Gerald Ford, is also moving towards the region.   

CBS reported that the Pentagon has also ordered some US troops out of the Middle East in case Iran launches a counterattack. The US military has multiple bases in the region such as Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Camp Arifjan in Kuwait.     

US outlet Axios reported that a US military operation against Iran could last for weeks. Israel would also take part in the operation, Axios said. 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel and meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming weeks to discuss the negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. As of now, no concrete deal on Iran's nuclear ambitions has been achieved.  

DW is bringing you the latest coverage on the current standoff between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear program.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that Iran cease its atomic program, which Washington sees as aimed at obtaining nuclear weapons.

Iran, which is adamant that its nuclear activities are and have always been civilian in nature, has expressed determination to continue them.

Talks in Geneva on Tuesday between US and Iranian negotiators appear to have borne little fruit, with the White House saying: ""We're still very far apart on some issues.""

Amid the tensions, the US has significantly built up a military presence near Iran, with multiple media reports on Wednesday suggesting that it could be ready to carry out strikes on Iran as soon as this weekend.

Coffee-growing regions are seeing more hot days as the climate changes, reducing yields, researchers say.  ""Climate change is coming for our coffee,"" said one climate scientist.

Key coffee-growing regions around the world are experiencing more days of heat driven by human-made climate change every year, which is leading to lower yields and higher prices for the commodity, researchers said on Wednesday.

The report comes as climate scientists say the world has seen the three hottest years on record as the use of fossil fuels and other human activities continue to cause the Earth's atmosphere to warm.

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

According to an analysis by the independent research group Climate Central, 25 countries that produce almost all the world's coffee experienced 47 days more of coffee-harming heat on average between 2021 and 2025.

The five countries that account for 75% of global coffee production — Brazil, Vietnam, Columbia, Ethiopia and Indonesia — saw 57 more days of such temperatures in the same period.

Temperatures above 30 C (86 F) are ""extremely harmful"" to arabica coffee plants — the dominant variety making up some 60-70% of global production —  and ""suboptimal"" for the robusta variety that accounts for most of the rest, Climate Central said.

For its analysis, Climate Central estimated how many days each year would have stayed below 30C in a world without global warming but exceeded that level in reality.

Kristina Dahl, Climate Central's vice president for science, said climate change posed a serious threat to coffee production.

""Climate change is coming for our coffee,"" she said.

""Nearly every major coffee-producing country is now experiencing more days of extreme heat that can harm coffee plants, reduce yields and affect quality,"" she added in a statement.

""In time, these impacts may ripple outward from farms to consumers, right into the quality and cost of your daily brew,"" she said.  

Climate Central said a recent surge in coffee prices around the world was ""at least partly"" caused by extreme weather in coffee-growing regions, with US tariffs on imports from Brazil, however, also playing a role.

Brazil's President Lula da Silva has arrived in New Delhi, while Google and Nvidia hail Indian expansion plans. Meanwhile, China felt the sting of intellectual property appropriation for once in a robot dog scandal.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was given the red carpet treatment on arrival in New Delhi on Wednesday, as he heads to the AI Impact Summit 2026. 

Lula is traveling with more than a dozen ministers and a large business delegation including CEOs of leading Brazilian companies, as he seeks to intensify trade ties with the world's most populous country. 

""India and Brazil share a close and multifaceted relationship,"" Indian Foreign Ministery spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement. 

India took over the presidency of the BRICS bloc from Brazil this year. Lula's visit follows a July 2025 visit to Brasilia by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the first by an Indian prime minister in more than 50 years. 

Lula will attend the New Delhi AI Impact Summit on Thursday and is set for talks with Modi over the weekend.

Brazil sees India as an under-tapped market for exports including cotton, seeds, teak, soybean oil and other minerals, including the rare earths market crucial to various tech development projects that India's uneasy neighbor China dominates.

French President Emmanuel Macron took center stage at the AI summit on Tuesday, when he and Modi launched a new helicopter assembly line as part of Modi's flagship ""Make in India"" project. 

The facility is a cooperation between India's Tata Group and European aviation giant Airbus and is located in Vemagal in the southern state of Karnataka. It is expected to be operational by April of this year. 

""Our collaboration with India is a win-win situation,"" said Jocelyn Gaudin, head of Airbus's engineering and innovation centre in Bengaluru.

European countries and India are trying to deepen economic ties after the EU and India signed a free trade deal in January which Modi touted as the ""mother of all trade deals."" 

As part of the agreement, India will eliminate tariffs on aircraft, a change likely to please Airbus, while levies on most machinery will also be reduced.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is also expected at the AI Impact Summit this week. On Wednesday he was in Delhi's renowned Lodhi district with India's Culture and Tourism Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat surveying a street art project. 

Some 20 heads of state and government in total are expected at the five-day event, which runs until Friday.

US tech giants also announced new Indian projects on Wednesday as industry leaders rushed to the fast-growing market.

Google's CEO Sundar Pichai told reporters that the company would build new subsea cables from India connecting to various parts of the world. 

""India's going to have an extraordinary trajectory with AI and we want to be a partner,"" Pichai told reporters. 

The company plans new direct undersea connections linking India to Singapore, South Africa and Australia, it said. This is part of Google's $15 billion (roughly €12.7 billion) project to construct the company's largest AI data center hub outside the US in the port city of Visakhapatnam in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh.

Meanwhile, California-based chip company Nvidia said it would team up with three Indian cloud computing providers to provide advanced processors for data centers that can train and run AI systems. 

Mumbai cloud and data centre provider L&T said Wednesday it was teaming up with Nvidia to build what it touted as ""India's largest gigawatt-scale AI factory"".

A flurry of deals have been unveiled at the AI summit, with IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw saying on Tuesday that India anticipates more than $200 billion in investments over the next two years, with roughly $90 billion already committed.

The massive event in New Delhi did face one minor scandal that grabbed headlines in India and beyond, however.

A private India university was kicked out of the event amid uproar after a staffer for the Galgotias University displayed a commercially available robotic dog manufactured in China and claimed it was the university's own innovation.

The claim was made in an interview with state-run broadcaster DD news, but internet users quickly identified the mechancial mutt as the Unitree Go2, sold by Chinese company Unitree Robotics at prices starting at $1,600. It's widely used in research and education.

On Wednesday morning, one US government official thought there was a 90 per cent chance of the US declaring war on Iran within weeks.

By Wednesday afternoon, when Donald Trump demanded that Sir Keir Starmer kept hold of the Diego Garcia military base, some had upgraded that to a “99 per cent chance”.

Exactly why Mr Trump suddenly turned on the Prime Minister's deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and rent back the joint US-UK base is unclear. 

The US president had issued a tepid endorsement of the agreement just two weeks ago.

But the theory spreading around Washington is that the US president's hand was forced by the prospect of imminent war with Iran.

It goes something like this: As he assembled the largest military force the Middle East has seen in decades, Mr Trump was being briefed on conducting military strikes against Tehran.

At that point, the critical role that Diego Garcia, the largest island in the Chagos Archipelago, would play in hosting US aircraft became clear.

B-2 bombers, used to devastating effect against Tehran in June, could reach Iran in a matter of hours from the base, which is outside the range of the regime's counter-strikes.

Some critics claim Britain would also have had to notify Mauritius, an ally of China and Tehran, that Diego Garcia would be used for a military operation.

Mr Trump, having been persuaded to endorse the deal earlier this month with the support of the state department after Sir Keir sweetened it by providing extra security guarantees, then swung back against it.

After all, why else would the US president's mind suddenly turn to a 17-square mile island in a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean?

“Trump isn't a master of details, but Starmer's deal probably came up in conversation,” Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official, told The Telegraph. “The question is, why now? There aren't many answers to that unless Trump was engaged in a conversation about military assets needed for an attack on Iran.”

Sumantra Maitra, a senior fellow at the Centre for Renewing America, predicted that there was now a “99 per cent chance” of the US launching a strike against Iran.

“We are still waiting on some kind of miracle from the Iranian side, but that doesn't look like that's happening any time soon,” he added.

In recent days, dozens of American fighter jets, including F-35s and F-16s, have been massing in the Middle East.

Analysts told The Telegraph they could be used to “kick the door in”, taking out Iranian defences before American bombers struck at the heart of the regime.

The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, accompanied by three destroyers, has been in position in the Arabian Sea since late January, while the USS Gerald R Ford is heading to reinforce it.

Mona Yacoubian, a former state department official, warned a conflict with Iran could quickly become inevitable, regardless of Mr Trump's strategy.

“This massive military build-up, together with Iran's sabre-rattling, runs the risk of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy,” she said.

There are reasons to believe that, even as top American and Iranian officials met for peace talks in Geneva on Tuesday, the US president's patience with Iran has frayed since he declared the US was “locked and loaded” in early January.

“The boss is getting fed up,” one senior adviser told Axios, while JD Vance, the US vice-president, said on Fox that Tehran had failed to acknowledge the US's red lines.

As goes Mr Trump, so goes the administration. Just hours before the US president's announcement on his Truth Social platform at 1.42pm EST, the state department had declared that the US supported Sir Keir's Chagos deal.

They all had to pivot on a dime. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, announced Mr Trump's social media post was administration policy since it came “straight from the horse's mouth”.

The state department said, in response to a request to comment by The Telegraph: “The president's Truth Social stands.” It did not respond when asked for clarification.

If administration figures were blindsided, one former senior Trump official claimed he was not surprised.

The US president “always held the view he expressed again today” but “some group in the state department decided to back the UK's position out of respect for a key ally”, he insisted.

It was no reflection on Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, he added, saying: “These are far lower-level decisions by likely career officials at state trying to do the right thing without realising it was on Trump's radar.”

Dr Maitra said Mr Trump did not appear to be aware of “just how much was happening” on Diego Garcia until recently.

The Chagos deal seemed to be a “tacit agreement between the state department and the British Government”, he said, calling it a “huge loss” for the Prime Minister.

Telegraph View

In the background, British politicians have been lobbying administration officials to try and force Sir Keir into a U-turn. Sir Iain Duncan Smith visited Washington this month, while Liz Truss, the former prime minister, was pictured with Mr Trump over the weekend.

Nigel Farage has also been involved in campaigning against the deal, having dined with Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, who has since raised concerns about the Chagos giveaway.

Sir Keir's careful cultivation of the US president appeared to have been vindicated when Mr Trump lent his backing, albeit reluctantly, to the Chagos agreement on Feb 5.

Now he has been humiliated and looks almost certain to be forced into one of the many U-turns that have been symptomatic of his Government. Ministers have previously indicated that the Chagos handover needs US support to go through.

“Even Trump's critics can take solace that a stopped clock is right twice a day,” Mr Rubin said, labelling the Prime Minister's deal “strategically unhinged and historically vapid”.

Mr Trump is no stranger to brinkmanship, and the White House insists his preference – for now – is diplomacy. But if war erupts, many will see this as the moment when it looked inevitable.

Donations From Billionaire's Daughter That Preceded Trump Pardon","https://truthout.org/articles/watchdog-group-seeks-fec-inquiry-into-donations-potentially-tied-to-trump-pardon/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:10:13 GMT","

The complaint alleges the donations had a singular goal: to elicit a pardon from Donald Trump.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

A nonprofit watchdog legal group has filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) alleging that a billionaire whom President Donald Trump pardoned made illegal straw donations to a Trump-aligned super PAC

The complaint filed earlier this week by the Campaign Legal Center (CLC) requests the FEC to open an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding donations to a group called MAGA Inc. It also alleges that the donations were made for the sole purpose of obtaining a pardon from Trump.

Venezuelan billionaire Julio Herrera Velutini was indicted in 2022 for violating federal bribery laws related to illegal donations he made to a candidate in Puerto Rico's gubernatorial elections. After Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Velutini's daughter, Isabela Herrera, began making donations to MAGA Inc.

The complaint notes that “making large donations to Trump's political network, which includes

MAGA Inc. as his primary super PAC, has become a well-documented tactic for those

seeking to obtain benefits, including favorable treatment by others facing civil and

criminal enforcement for illegal activity, from the Trump administration.”

Notably, Velutini, a Venezuelan national, cannot legally make political donations like these himself. And the 25-year-old Herrera, whose donations totaled around $3.5 million from December 2024 to July 2025, is not independently wealthy, the complaint stated. 

Herrera “lack[ed] the financial means” to make such donations, and didn't seem to demonstrate any “interest in electoral politics to suddenly contribute millions of dollars to a super PAC,” according to the complaint from CLC. Indeed, her only other donation to a political cause, prior to December 2024, was $20 to Pete Buttigieg in 2020.

According to the complaint:

The timing and circumstances surrounding the contributions, and the fact that Herrera appears to lack the financial means or any demonstrated interest in electoral politics to suddenly contribute millions of dollars to a super PAC, provide reason to believe that Herrera was not the true contributor, and that the money instead was provided by her billionaire father, whose freedom appeared to hinge on the contributions—but who, as a foreign national, could not legally make the contributions himself.

The complaint claims that the donations  sought to curry favor with Trump in order to elicit a pardon for Velutini, as other “ultrawealthy” contributors to Trump or his allied groups have done before. 

And that's exactly what happened. Herrera's last donation was made in July 2025. In August, the Department of Justice (DOJ) presented Velutini with a plea bargain deal, and in January, Trump issued him “a full and unconditional pardon.”

In a Bluesky thread sharing a link to the complaint, CLC reiterated the need for an inquiry.

“The sequence of events before and after the daughter's contributions strongly suggest that she was an illegal ‘straw donor' used by her father to secure political favor and, consequently, clemency from the Trump administration,” CLC wrote in the social media post. “If so, billionaire Julio Herrera Velutini broke more than the laws meant to keep election spending transparent and voters informed: He also illegally sought to influence American politics as a foreign national.”

The complaint doesn't allege Trump engaged in any illegal action. As president, the U.S. Constitution gives Trump unrestricted power to pardon anyone, save for individuals facing impeachment, without any oversight whatsoever.

However, an inquiry into Velutini's and Herrera's donation scheme could uncover potential problems for Trump still if evidence shows that he issued the pardon because of the money that was given to MAGA Inc. While not technically illegal, it could still be deemed an impeachable offense by Congress.

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

The need for truthful, grassroots reporting is urgent at this cataclysmic historical moment. Yet, Trump-aligned billionaires and other allies have taken over many legacy media outlets — the culmination of a decades-long campaign to place control of the narrative into the hands of the political right.

In the latest episode of “Movement Memos,” host Kelly Hayes talks with journalist Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, about what it means to live under a concentration camp regime — and how people can fight back. Pitzer explains how mass detention systems are built through “end runs” around the law, how they become normalized, and why the rapid expansion of U.S. detention infrastructure signals a dangerous escalation.

[musical interlude]

KH: Andrea Pitzer, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Andrea Pitzer: Hi, Kelly. Thanks for having me on.

KH: How are you doing today?

AP: Probably like a lot of people. I am weighted down by the reality all around us. So many people are suffering and that suffering is so deliberately inflicted on them. It's a hard thing, but I am also buoyed up by all the people who are meeting this moment with grace and joy and beauty and a lot of bravery as well. And so it's kind of a burden and a relief to have a really specific idea what I need to be doing these days, and so I'm trying to show up for that.

KH: All of that resonates so much. My heart is constantly breaking, and I'm also constantly finding strength in solidarity, and in people who are leading by example in this moment. 

For folks who may be unfamiliar with your work, can you tell the audience a bit about what you do?

AP: So I am originally from West Virginia, so I grew up in the U.S., and have lived a lot of my adulthood in the greater … in Washington, D.C. or in the surrounding area. And I am a narrative journalist who mostly writes books about international history. I've written about Vladimir Nabokov, the guy who wrote Lolita. My most recent book was a shipwreck book from the time of Shakespeare that also dives into imperialism, climate change, the very idea of a polar hero.

But really, I guess the reason you and I are talking here today is that my second book, One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, and that really runs from the 1890s up to the present. I wanted to tackle the idea of the modern concentration camp, so what happened after barbed wire and automatic weapons showed up. And I went to 18 countries, I think it was, on four continents to report that and also to Guantánamo.

And in addition to that background, and that's so important for what we're going to talk about today, I'll also just add that for most of a decade, I worked in D.C. I have a black belt in martial arts, and I did a lot of self-defense work with rape crisis survivors and refugees, political refugees from various countries that experienced violence. And so before I got into journalism and before I became a book author, I was really working at a community level and looking at violence that way, and I think that still really informs a lot of what I'm doing now.

KH: There is such a constant barrage of injustice, indignity, atrocity, and absurdity under this administration that getting our bearings is really a daily task. I'm grateful for analysis that helps people make sense of what's happening, and translate that clarity into action. That's definitely how I experience your writing around the subject of concentration camps.

In your work, you describe how societies move toward mass detention and concentration-camp systems, drawing on global historical examples. Can you walk us through that process, and why you believe the United States is becoming a concentration-camp regime?

AP: So one of the things that I learned researching this history of concentration camps was that looking at all these different places that had had this kind of detention, and by “this kind of detention,” I mean the mass detention of civilians, so not prisoners of war, but the mass detention of civilians without due process or trial on the basis of identity, and that could be political affiliation, ethnicity, religion, race, it can be a number of factors, but it's something about who the detainees are rather than really specific treatment of individual things that they have done, and the patterns that I found were kind of extraordinary.

And I see the U.S. has its own history with regard to this, and the ways in which it's changing now are very much in line with the places that became concentration camp regimes. And that all sounds kind of muddy, so just to clarify, concentration camps rise when you're doing an end run around the law. So in all these different countries over more than a hundred years, they had really different legal systems, they had really different political systems, but these kinds of mass detention of people was always something that happened outside the existing normal body of law. And it was often dependent on how the law had been used before and sort of what you could get away with making quasi-legal or sort of shepherding in. But in each case, there was this sense of what was the existing legal structure and then some need to get around it in order to target particular groups of people.

And in the U.S., we've had so many different kinds of detention that touched a little bit on this, and maybe we can talk about those later in the conversation, but what I saw is this weaponization of it that's happening now is in the way that our long history with immigrant detention is exploding and mushrooming into a vast network of massive detention facilities, mostly for non-”criminals” and for very little regard of whether someone is or isn't a “criminal,” and criminality is its own whole issue, which I would take issue with. But in terms of how these systems evolve, they tend to draw in a majority of people that have not been labeled criminal in that society before, but which a political actor at the head of a party or at the head of a country in terms of governing, like President Trump and his allies are for us right now, where they want to target particular groups for political benefit to entrench power and to exert control over the country as a whole.

And so some of that has always been happening in the U.S., but the kind of expansion that we saw Congress give funding-wise, the kind of attempts to create this force which existed before — we have Border Patrol, we have ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] — but to be specifically in allegiance to the executive branch, to the president, answerable to his commands, his wishes, and those of his minions. And we are seeing the potential damage, the potential harm that already existed before, but sort of going, as I've described it in the book that I wrote, from the A-bomb to the H-bomb.

KH: I appreciate that you paused to problematize the category of “criminal.” Part of what we're seeing right now is an at-will expansion of criminalization as a tool of dehumanization — an effort to justify violence by redefining whole groups of people as inherently criminal. We've heard this administration describe those being rounded up as criminals by default, and we've also seen escalating rhetoric labeling ICE observers and rapid-response organizers as domestic terrorists or potential assassins.

Criminalization in the United States has long functioned as a way of producing human disposability — a permission structure for cultural forgetting. And it's particularly frightening to watch that logic intensify in this moment.

You resist simple equivalencies in your work, but you deliberately use the term “concentration camp.” Some critics argue that we shouldn't invoke comparisons to foreign regimes, especially when so much of this violence is rooted in U.S. history itself. You've argued that we need a broader lens — one that draws on global history alongside the legacies of slavery, Native genocide, Japanese internment, Jim Crow, and criminalization. Why is that expansive historical frame necessary?

AP: Yes. I'm so glad you asked this because what happens is this is an international phenomenon. The concentration camp phenomenon, again, as I mentioned before, with the weaponization of barbed wire and automatic weapons, you begin to be able to hold a very large population with a really small guard force. So it's literally this technical pivot that allowed what we saw happening in the 20th century — with vast, enormous camps holding thousands and thousands of people — to even become possible, really.

And so there is always that international trend that's worth following, and I would also say that some of the solutions people have found to try to push back or undo those systems from abroad can be really useful to think about in the U.S. context as well. But in any case, every concentration camp system rises out of that particular society's weakness. So there's this international trend, but it's really this domestic culture that allows camps to rise in that place. And so when we look at what allows camps to rise in the U.S., it is these fissure lines that from the beginning we have seen related to Native genocide, related to the history of chattel slavery, related to immigration for a century or more, and actually more than a century at this point. And in each of those cases, that is where you find, that is where the immoral and amoral leadership in a government finds the fissure points in the culture, finds the wedge issues, finds the way to identify the target population that can be scapegoated, and that can then serve as the conduit through which the police state is firmly entrenched and established. And concentration camps are often sort of the pivot point on which that can be first addressed to that vulnerable population and then extended much more broadly.

And so I think that to even consider this question, you have to look at both those international trends and the ways things develop, but also exactly what's happening locally. You can't separate the two. And so I deliberately use the term concentration camp because I think people say, “Well, we've always been unkind to immigrants,” or, “Well, we have a long history of targeting Black people.” The police do, for instance. These conversations tend to portray these issues as organic and therefore what we are doing can't be like those other places. And I think it's a real failure of imagination to not realize the ways in which this can be made worse, and that the international lens and using that term, concentration camp, can be clarifying to understand the possibilities that are set before us now and the ways that U.S. culture may offer some advantages in fighting this and the ways in which we are really starting out at a deficit. And so it can be a lens through which people will see their society in a way that they haven't been able to think about it before.

KH: I really agree with you about what this language has the potential to clarify for people. I know there's been some pushback around using the term “concentration camp” in a U.S. context, and I find those critiques ahistorical. This isn't language that belongs exclusively to one regime or one country — it's a term with a broader historical meaning. I wish this phenomenon were an isolated historical occurrence. I understand why people might want to imagine it that way. But of course it's not — and it wasn't even isolated during the Second World War. I don't think many people realize that presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman described the internment camps where Japanese Americans were forcibly incarcerated during World War II as “concentration camps” — and only Truman meant it in a bad way.I also really appreciate your insistence that what we're facing is both homegrown and globally entangled. 

The United States has cultivated and exported enormous harm — sometimes refining tactics abroad before bringing them home. At the same time, contemporary fascists are borrowing from European movements and histories. These currents flow into each other. None of this is contained within a singular nation. We're in a global struggle against fascism, whether we recognize it or not.

And while reactionaries are sharing strategies across borders, we need an analysis that isn't siloed. We can't pretend this is only imported, and we can't pretend it's purely domestic. It's both. These aren't abstractions — they're living movements, in motion, adapting and learning from one another.

Listening to you, I'm also thinking about Ruth Wilson Gilmore's definition of racism as “the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death.” That differentiation isn't new in the United States. But the scale and the methods of exploitation can intensify. The stakes can escalate. And we have to be honest about when that escalation is happening.

Which brings me to a recent report by Pablo Manríquez about the repurposing of a Department of Defense contract to rapidly expand detention and deportation infrastructure — essentially enabling the construction of tent cities and self-contained facilities across the country. What does that move signal to you?

AP: So this is really grim. I am always also aware of things we can be doing to address it, but this is a grim step because on a practical level, this contract, the way that they have been routing this now through the Navy, it expedites everything and it shortens the window by which we can effectively interfere with the plan. It entrenches things more quickly. It makes it more difficult, whether it's for elected officials or for individuals like you and me, to be able to step in and intervene. Once we have that funding and once it is routed through the WEXMAC contract, I think that it is a way of drawing boundaries around their ability to stand up these facilities quickly. And so we should see it for the escalation that it is. We should see it for the danger that it is. We should be already talking to our representatives about what kinds of actions can be taken, whether it's now or whether it's potentially after some shifts with the election later this year to defund, to dismantle. We have to already be looking toward the future routes to doing that because it's going to be much more difficult with this, the way that they're implementing this.

On a conceptual level, it goes back to what I was saying before as well. It is an end run around normal procedure. This is how we know it's a concentration camp regime. We have lots of ways of building detention facilities in the U.S. We have lots of people that everyone in power has tacitly or implicitly agreed to treat different groups and who can go in those facilities, but this literal physical expansion to the number of beds, expanding those possibilities, but also this end run around normal procedure means that the accountability is lower. It means that it usually foretells a very grim plan that governing bodies have or governing leadership has for the rights of individuals. So it's a shot across the bow of just how far Stephen Miller and [Pete] Hegseth and Trump are willing to take this.

I think even many elected Republican representatives and senators don't understand what's happening right now, even as they're voting for these things. And that's not to say some of them wouldn't approve it if they did know, but I think lacking this greater context, people all across the country don't realize we are entrenching the kind of concentration camp system — literally the numbers that they were talking about even before the election, 15 million, 20 million. Only 18 million people went through the entire Soviet … In the entire multi-decade existence of the Soviet Gulag, 18 million people went through it, and they're talking about doing that in the short term and building a system to meet those kinds of numbers.

So when you are doing that, you are talking about something on that scale. There are very few systems — there are some, but there are very few in human history that reach the kind of scale that they're talking about and the detention beds that they're talking about and keeping … I'm sure most of your listeners already know, but just to touch on it here, that what we're talking about is something that will eclipse the U.S. prison system, which is already this unbelievably carceral institution. And I think the U.S., as we've been saying, has long had these police state dynamics that applied to some categories of residents and that the society has created a thing where in theory that's okay with a lot of people, but it's anathema to the national self-concept that “America” — America in the narrow U.S. sense of the word, it's anathema to that self-concept that the country has.

And so a lot of the success that past movements have had is pushing back against, finding that gap between the police state dynamics that already existed and the country's self-image of freedom and democracy. And so activists have successfully pushed back, often at really great cost, in order to highlight that gap and trigger accountability and to trigger change. But what is happening now is a massive broadening of those tactics to apply in settings to people and places that normally would have been considered off-limits for those kinds of police state dynamics, or they wouldn't be deployed as openly.

And that itself is an assertion of power to say that the communities of exception, the ones that we've allowed to be abused in the past as a country, and the state of exception, situations in which people's rights can be ignored, it's clear the government is trying to extend that to all groups, to everyone, and to all the time, so that the state of exception becomes a permanent one. When you have that entrenched concentration camp system, when you have enough personnel, which they don't yet, and you have the beds, which they're accelerating toward, then you can work to make that happen, and I think that's what we're seeing.

KH: We're also seeing the legitimization of this steady expansion — this creep in who the government claims the authority to disappear into the system. The recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit backing ICE's mass detention policy essentially affirms that anyone in immigration proceedings can be held in custody. By upholding this policy, the court broadens the pool of people who can be jailed and strengthens the legal foundation for large-scale detention.

On the ground, DHS [the Department of Homeland Security] and ICE aren't just talking about expanding capacity — they're building it. Federal reports and investigative coverage show multiple purchases of large warehouse properties across states including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, each hundreds of thousands of square feet, as part of planned “mega” detention facilities, with Bloomberg reporting plans for roughly two dozen warehouses nationwide. The proposed concentration camp in El Paso would be “the largest jail of any kind in the country.”

At the same time, the Department of Defense and DHS are moving forward with the “soft-sided” tent-based encampments Manríquez wrote about, which he described as “rapid deployment of self-contained cities.” And I think it's worth noting that these “self-contained” tent cities would house up to 10,000 people each and include biohazard incinerators. 

There has been meaningful pushback — people in Mississippi recently blocked the creation of a warehouse facility, and in Kansas City, sustained protests and political pressure led a developer to abandon plans to sell a large warehouse for ICE detention. We know that Native people have waged site fights, including the Miccosukee Nation's fight against so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” facility in Florida. All of these efforts matter. They slow things down, raise the political cost, and expose what's being built.

I also think this is a moment where some of our newly mobilized co-strugglers can learn a lot from abolitionist organizers who have waged a lot of site fights to stop jails, prisons, and detention facilities from being built over the years. And we're clearly going to need that kind of grassroots action. Because nothing that the Democrats are proposing actually has the power to stop the progression we're describing. 

From your perspective, as someone who has studied how these systems are built, normalized, and sustained, what kinds of demands actually meet the scale of the threat? And what outcomes should people be organizing toward if the infrastructure itself is expanding this rapidly?

AP: So there's a lot. I'll try to touch on a few things. I think that in my newsletter, since the beginning, I have been trying to encourage people to be networking and be active on a local level, and here's a good example where that can be a really beneficial thing to have those networks already in place or to make them quickly. If you live in a place where ICE is not currently slated to have a facility, work with your local representatives to create a situation that it will be more difficult for them to do that. Now, the federal government has a lot of power, but if you can get your community involved preemptively, you can make yourself much less attractive. And I would say that's critical for people that live in red areas as well. We are seeing, in some cases, we are seeing Republican senators stepping in in order to sort of NIMBY this and say, “Not in my backyard.” And I mean, it's terrible if they get pushed to blue areas instead, but any time this can be slowed, any time it can be stopped, it's a good thing.

So getting involved locally is critical: demonstrating, showing up at city council meetings, finding out who has those properties, getting them to commit not to sell in the first place. I mean, these are all ways that people can be acting preemptively if this hasn't yet come to your backyard. If it is already in your backyard, it will depend very much on what that contract is and how it's working, but there are always contractors. And so targeting those contractors, targeting any employees that work in that facility, denying them the ability to work in municipal jobs or in teaching anywhere in your community, perhaps anywhere in the state, if you can get your state legislators behind it. So those are things that you can do locally and on a state level.

I think on a national level, we need to be pressing our elected representatives. We need to be pushing through organizations of change to educate the community and to educate, frankly, our politicians about some of what you and I are discussing today, because while I'm very much in favor of the kind of hemming in that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer are talking about with ICE, that you cannot just ask the mask question and not look at what is happening, look at the underlying mechanics of what we're faced with. And I understand that when you're in the minority party, your hands are tied, but this is a moment, if ever there was a moment, where a vocal opposition is absolutely critical because some of these people can most quickly, more quickly than most of us are able to, actually tell the American people what is coming, make Republicans take a stand on it, put it in those terms.

I was gratified to see — I think it was LaMonica McIver who was asking some pretty hard questions of acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, and pushing to discuss the enormous immorality of what is unfolding before our eyes and what Congress is actively abetting in this moment. And I have seen it myself, the camp at Guantánamo, and I went to Gitmo twice. It started out as an expeditionary camp, and it's a slightly different contract than what we saw with WEXMAC, but it is, in fact, a similar thing. I slept in these kinds of tents that they're talking about. Press there, that's where we slept. The courtroom is an expeditionary courtroom, and they're talking about building expeditionary courtrooms. And expeditionary means, literally, it's movable. You can go in, you can set it up very quickly, you can throw it in, and that was how the tribunal setup at Guantánamo was built.

And my point in bringing that up again here is once more to say that what has happened in the past sets the stage for the future. Immigrants' detention on a mass level was how detention started at Gitmo before it became “war on terror” detention. And so if we look at these camps being established around the U.S. using the same expeditionary means, but instead of doing it somewhere outside the normal borders (what are generally observed as the borders of the U.S.), now it's being turned inward, and that is also part of concentration camp history, that what was done initially at the turn of the 20th century in colonial settings was brought then into the heart of empire. And I think that is part of what we're seeing in the U.S. right now, an importation of those very tactics that we've put out on the world.

And so the way that you resist them is to draw attention to them, is to organize against them, is to protest at the sites where they will be happening. But I think that there is a lot that can be done, still, at the political level, whether it's local or national, because if you name this for what it is and show what it is, the vast majority of Americans will not support it. There are hardcore groups of racists, there is another group that doesn't care if it happens as long as it happens out of sight, and then there are the people that don't want it to happen. And if you combine the second and third group, you have a majority of people in the U.S. and they will not want this. But once it's built, just as we see with Guantánamo today, it is very difficult to make it go away.

KH: I want to say a bit more about the chasm between reforms that the Democrats are offering and the popular demand to abolish ICE. There's so much complexity to address here that we aren't going to piece our way through today, but I am personally very frustrated by the focus on reforms like body cameras, because we've been here before. People really believed that body cameras would reduce police violence, and we've seen what a momentous failure that effort has been. We've actually seen an increase in the number of people killed by police since body cameras went into widespread use. So, in addition to having a major uptick in mass surveillance, where cops can generate footage to criminalize people just by walking around, we've also found that footage of police killing people, filmed from their perspective, doesn't disincentivize killing, and doesn't lead to greater accountability. There was a recent piece by Matt Novak in Gizmodo that explained that there was actually a brief stint of police getting busted for planting evidence more often around 2017, when they were still learning how body cameras worked, and didn't understand when they were and weren't filming, but that didn't last, and the obvious explanation is that they adapted. So, I really want people to internalize that making connections between the struggle against police violence and the violence of incarceration is crucial here, both in terms of having an analysis of what doesn't work, and also what can. 

I'm also thinking about something you wrote in your recent piece, “Into the abyss.” You said: “Nobody sane now thinks the answer to abuses at Dachau was to give the guards more training.” Can you talk about the need to disempower the people who are perpetrating these harms and the apparatuses that enact that violence?

AP: So obviously we need to use our votes, but we also need to understand the power we have in society. And so that can be through shaming, that can be through institutions that are already in place for moral accountability in the U.S. I think there's tremendous possibility, which we've already seen, and we saw it with [faith leaders challenging Rep.] Rosa DeLauro, and we've seen it on the front lines in a number of cities where we have clergy from different faiths that are coming together and asserting that moral situation.

But in terms of disempowering, we have to actually … This “abolish ICE” idea, it's not an ephemeral idea. And I used the Dachau example to be not exactly provocative, but to be concrete because that's what we're talking about. That's what we're fighting. When Dachau came into existence, it was not that different than what we are already doing. And so this willingness that we've had to create a state, a nation in which millions are imprisoned way out of line with other developed countries, with countries with similar backgrounds, with countries with similar diversity quotients, I would say when you add that on to what our immigration system has become, you see the nexus of how our current situation is formed.

And so this abolish ICE idea is going to mean that we need to get rid of these camps. We need to deprive the contractors of jobs. We need to put our bodies on the line to call attention to what's happening inside them. We need to call for access to them. In the end, what we need to do is to create an immigration system that does not have punitive detention — or even really detention at the heart of it, or we will, because of our histories, we will always be setting this up. And I would also argue that we need to do that with the carceral state in general, but the place that we can start with is undoing it.

And I actually had … I've had senators call me privately to discuss this at various points in the last decade. And in each case, they were not really unwilling, but they were unable to imagine an immigration system that didn't have detention at the heart of it, even though so much of what we're seeing now has really come into being in the last 20 to 30 years. And so I think one huge thing for that dismantling is the imagining of pathways: bureaucratically and structurally, what would that border look like? What would that be?

And I don't want to minimize the hard work that is involved in all of this. You start the work and you don't know when it will be finished. But one thing I will say is that … that concentration camp system being dismantled is a huge first step in terms of protecting life and envisioning a way out of that police state. And so I think that it should be the heart of what we are dealing with now.

I think particularly the facilities, even though with these expeditionary contracts in place and with many of these facilities bought, if you want to compare it to a video game, the skill level at which we have to play has jumped exponentially, but literally educating people about what is happening and what the stakes are is a really vital part.

KH: I really appreciate this call to action, and I also appreciate something you've named in our conversations, which is that as massive as these efforts are, and as bleak as things may seem, so many of the concentration camp apparatuses that have been created globally have been dismantled. We know this can be done, because it has been done, and it will be done again. Will we do it, and what are we willing to do to make it happen? Those are the real questions. 

Something else that's coming up for me, particularly as a prison abolitionist, is that part of this work of making the atrocity visible is staying in touch with people on the inside, and refusing to let them be wholly disappeared or forgotten. That's a tradition as old as imprisonment and slavery, and it's very much alive in the culture of abolitionist organizing and immigration justice work. It's also another reason that independent media and movement media are so important right now. Because the corporate media and the legacy media are key actors in the work of social and cultural forgetting. So, we need to support people who are capturing the truth of what's happening, and we need to amplify that work — whether they're doing it in a publication or in their own grassroots activism. Because, as my friends who've been attacked by ICE in the streets are constantly saying, if they would do this to me out in the open, what do you think they're doing in the camps and detention centers? And I would add that: If they can so easily distract people from what they are doing in broad daylight, we need to take seriously the work of exposing what's happening behind the walls and barbed-wired fences of detention. That has to be our work, because the people we'd like to believe would do it are not doing it.And on that note, I really want to praise L.A. Taco's coverage of the ongoing vigils at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, and the community members gathering there. People in that facility have been throwing bottles of lotion with messages wrapped around them over fences and walls to communicate with the people holding vigil outside. Those communications have allowed people to provide material support to some of the people inside. In some cases, they're getting the A-numbers of imprisoned people, which allows supporters to deposit commissary funds and funds for phone calls. Some of these detainees haven't been able to speak to their loved ones in a very long time, so that's crucial support. And while this support is happening, these communications are also allowing detainees to spread the word about conditions inside. One of the notes someone threw over the wall said, “We are all constantly sick.” 

We know that 32 people died in immigration detention last year. We know that when children at ICE's Dilley detention center get sick, they're told to drink water, when detainees say it's the water that's making them sick. We know an 18 month-old baby nearly died at Dilley, after being hospitalized for respiratory failure, and then denied the medication that doctors prescribed. It's clear that all of this will escalate as the concentration camp system expands. So, I think we really need to ground ourselves, our politics, and our sense of what's necessary in that understanding. 

I also want to circle back to something else that you said before. You said that what we're seeing now is similar to what was going on at Dachau in the beginning. Could you say more about that?

AP: Sure. So there's this idea, I think … Well, and one thing to be clear about is that people imagine, when they think, “Nazi concentration camp,” they think, “death camp.” And so just if there's any listeners that … There's a reason I'm picking Dachau, I would say, instead of Auschwitz here. And Auschwitz is where factory-style mass executions were happening. It was literally, “How quickly can we kill this community of people that we've designated for death,” which is a different phenomenon than we see in the non-death camps that existed across Nazi Germany for almost a decade before the death camp system arose.

And yet those other camps, those concentration camps, the pre-death camps, were also lethal. And like most of the systems around the world, the lethality was more often due to other kinds of harm than mass-factory-style executions. There would occasionally be firing squads, but more often disease, malnutrition in some of the very early colonial-style camps. And I think since these are expeditionary camps, we're going to see and we are already seeing this kind of thing in Camp East Montana, for instance. We see deaths from guards choking someone. We see deaths, we see illness — massive illness from tuberculosis, from measles.

And some of those early colonial camps, where the camps were sited and the conditions in them, we think of what I call the Everglades Camp, which a lot of people call “Alligator Alcatraz,” deliberately sited to do harm to those detainees. A lot of the early Northern German camps when the Nazis first came to power were work camps and labor camps. And then they would slowly devolve into these worse settings, into these more institutionalized, more hard infrastructure, poured concrete or designed by an architect for better surveillance. You see this shift that takes about six or seven years.

But in those early days at Dachau, one of the most amazing things that happened was there was a man named Hans Beimler who actually managed to escape, and there is still some open question of how exactly he did it because those stories — there were rumors about Dachau and there were horrific gossip reports that were making their way out. And even The New York Times was letting some people into camps briefly to look at them, of course under really controlled circumstances, but what made a huge difference was when this man — Hans Beimler, who was a communist deputy in the Reichstag in Germany — who was arrested and he was held there and he was tortured. And one of his colleagues was tortured to death and they were trying to get him to commit suicide himself. They were trying to drive him to despair.

And I think that's a little what we're seeing already happening in some of these U.S. situations, but he managed to escape and he was able to get out of the country and he wrote a story. He wrote the account of what had happened in there. And it was one of the first accounts that people had of when people were arrested, and how they'd get taken from these different places, and how the guards actively left some people alone and actively tortured others. But of course, it created this hell for everybody because once you see someone tortured, once you experience it once yourself … And this was something that a woman that I interviewed who had been tortured in Argentina under dictatorship told me, is that you only need these things to happen once. You only need to see them happen once to understand that these people can do what they want to you whenever they want.

And so part of what's happening that was happening at Dachau as well is we're witnessing an assertion of power. And right now it's these several millions that are currently targeted, and the people that are pushing back — so the Renee Goods, the Alex Prettis, and the many people showing up in Chicago and L.A. and D.C. at facilities or when they see someone grabbed on the street. For right now, these are the only people that can be targeted, but the entire operation, as was the first months and years of Nazi Germany, is an attempt to install the omnipotence to just change the category of who you wanted to do it to.

And the big concerning thing is that the resources have already been set aside for this, but they have gone, I think, in my opinion, and this is what gives me some hope, they have gone too quickly, and that the population has not been, as a whole, sufficiently propagandized enough the way that the Nazi Germany population was. They have not had control. They are getting it. We see the billionaires buying these things and then kowtowing. We see Trump exerting influence. We certainly had Rush Limbaugh for decades. We had Fox News for decades. But as a whole, the U.S. population has not experienced the hardcore propaganda year after year that would allow them, allow the government to assert this power and simply lock up anybody they want.

And people are horrified. We see this in the massive changes in public polling about immigration. And that's one of the reasons I think it's critical to stop this now while we have the literal physical ability to stop some of these facilities from coming online, but also it's critical to act now while immigration opinion is volatile because there are things that could happen that would swing it back the other way. So we have this, I think, ideal moment in which we can be acting, which is right now.

And just to make sure this is said, and I should probably say it 20 times every time I speak to anybody, but one of the good things — the U.S. has its own deficits, but one of the good things about it is that right now, most Americans, certainly not all, but most Americans actually have more freedom to act and to stand up against the government than almost any system that I've looked at around the world in the research that I've done. Most Americans can still exert those rights. We are seeing that it has real risks, that we have some people that have died doing that, but most Americans will not face those kinds of penalties. And if enough of us stand up, we will be able to stop this.[musical interlude]

We have to be physically present in front of the people that have power to do things. We have to be physically present at the places and sites where this is happening. But I know for some people, that either because of disability or because of their responsibilities for elders or for young children, I mean, not everybody can psychologically or physically be out on front lines as I see every time I see a new photo of you from somewhere. But I am in awe of the people that have come up with extraordinary ways to make really valuable contributions when they can't be present in that way that I think we do have to be present, but there's lots of room for other things.

And I think of Megan Piontkowski, who was an illustrator who basically took it on herself to help create these ICE zines for all over the country. And people can just download them with their local info, and if you need to make a call in, what to report. I mean, stuff that most Americans, I would say, who are not active, don't even know how to begin to start. Dan Sinker, who is working with lots of other people, producing hundreds of thousands of whistles. And these alone are not sufficient, of course, in and of themselves, but by building ourselves into whatever part of a network, we, I think, realize our strengths, we realize how many of us there are, and also it infiltrates the community itself and you really can change the nature of a community and what it does.

I'm forgetting the name of the person who said it, but there was the thing of when fugitive slave laws were being reinforced in the North, it suddenly made abolitionists out of all of these people that before, as we had talked about, this group of people that was kind of willing to let things happen if they didn't have to know about them — there are a lot of people that will wind up contributing mightily if you can show them what is actually happening. They aren't necessarily intentionally averting their eyes, although there are people that do that. There are some that — it is made so convenient in U.S. society to not see what is happening for many people, whether it's on the basis of how they live or where they work or who their circles are. And so I think that there's tremendous power in all that.

And I know people want the magic answer of, “Oh, if you do this one weird trick that I can tell you they did in Chile in 1978, it's going to undo the whole system.” There's nothing, there's no one magic trick here, right? This is going to be hard work. Even if the elections were to go radically against Trump and his supporters, we are looking at generational damage here. This is going to be years to undo. And I think that we ourselves, individuals and the communities that we form, the networks that we form in our communities, are the biggest answer to this. We are the ones that are going to solve this.

KH: In your recent piece, you noted that, “In most cases, there's a three-to-five-year window after a ruling party or leader or revolutionary brigade comes to power and asserts the right to arbitrarily detain and punish civilians.” Can you say more about that?

AP: Sure. So what I found was that in most systems, so in all the ones you've heard of and some that you wouldn't have, there seems to be this period between the third year and the fifth year after coming to power in which they have already been asserting this ability to do a kind of, again, end run around the existing system, a kind of bonus concentration camp-style mass detention of civilians that wasn't done on that scale before, in some cases wasn't done at all before, and there usually comes a conflict point. And it was strange that it was so consistently in this three-to-five-year window because it would be for different reasons.

Sometimes it would be, as the U.S. did in Chile, after the car bomb assassination of [former minister under Chilean President Salvador Allende] Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., the US government, which had been very supportive of [Gen. Augusto] Pinochet and the other generals, said, “Whoa,” and I'm paraphrasing here but, “this is getting a little out of hand.” And they put pressure on the Chilean secret police, the DINA, and the DINA was, in response to that and some other things, dismantled. And so this move toward mass detention that had been existing in Chile for a time got scaled back to more typical secret police activities and on a smaller scale. And so in that case, you had foreign pressure and intervention.

I think also of how the Khmer Rouge existed for a certain number of years, and in that three-to-five-year window then you had external pressure, you had external invasion that shifted it. But more often, it's something like what happened in the Nazi era, which is you have a battle between existing power factions. And in this case, it would be those who wanted to use the legal system and who had power — Nazis, to be clear. Nazis who had power under the legal system, the law, the traditional system, were fighting with the Nazis who had this sort of end-run concentration camp-style power. And there was actually, there was a window in which they started to dial the camps way down. Numbers were tiny. Dilley holds more people now than were in most of the detention facilities in that moment. And so, I mean, total. In all, they equaled something more on the scale of Dilley. And then the concentration camp faction won out.

And U.S. history now is very strange in this field because we had that intervention because unlike most of these places, we still had the capability for elections, and we had an election and we brought [Joe] Biden in and it hit a pause button. So that's year four. You did see this shift, and it did hit a pause button on some things. The deliberate expansion and overreach and entrenchment that we're seeing now didn't happen under Biden, but what also didn't happen under Biden was you didn't actually have a fundamental shift in how immigration detention was happening. You didn't have a fundamental rollback of the tools that Trump used when he came in in his first administration to do things like the Muslim ban, to do things like family separations, to become visually/optically aggressive about the way that immigrants were being detained and to begin to create this propaganda arm within the government to be pushing that on people.

So some of those things got paused, but not undone. And as a result, with Trump coming back a second time … And meanwhile, you had Biden's actions and university actions with protesters around the Gaza issue, which completely dismantled, in many ways, the ability for university students to take on a traditional role in protests that we would be seeing much more now if that hadn't happened under Biden. So in some cases, Biden actually made the situation worse for where we are now, but in some cases it was paused.

So I've been trying to figure out: Where are we in that three-to-five-year time frame now, because I think we were already on the back end of it when the country said, “Hey, let's bring in other people,” but then enough change wasn't made. And so I think, in some ways, we've picked up almost where we left off and a year has gone by. So my assessment of the situation, again, this was never a totally hard and fast thing, but as a sort of a general rule, but we are already on the back end of that five years now.

And so my sense is that this year is the last one that we have to try to stop this before we already have a fully entrenched concentration camp state, and the actions with the budget allocations that were done last year with these moves to the WEXMAC contract now and the kind of staffing we're seeing, the push and the huge bonuses to try to recruit ICE and Border Patrol folks, it's all coming together and it's not there yet, but one could easily see how by the end of the year we would have … I think that they're going to far exceed the 100,000 beds that they initially set as their goal.

And by the time you have that size of a camp system, as a country, our ability to push back becomes much more difficult. In a lot of these facilities — and I'll say particularly the ones that are affiliated with military bases — the visibility level, the cutting off from society is much, much more severe and it's harder to track. 

And yet I will say, because I've seen it all over the world, people do manage to smuggle out things. The lotion bottles go over the fence. Things get scribbled. There was one person who actually managed to send a postcard from detention that had an actual, the real thing … They managed to slip out basically between someone else's postcards a postcard that said what was happening in the camp, and it stayed fastened together long enough to make it out of the country. And on that basis, [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower ended up pulling somebody out of a Soviet Gulag camp and he was released. And so the ways in which people still find to get around those boundaries are astounding, but here we are on the back of that three-to-five-year [time frame]. I guess we're on the five-plus model right now, and that is a really dangerous place to be.

And one other thing I should say is that it is so much … Not only do I think we have the capacity to stop this, but it is so dependent on us to do it because a lot of concentration camp systems in the past, when activists tried to call attention to them and get the stories out, one of the things they were doing was to try to appeal to countries that at least nominally espoused democracy. And so Europe and the U.S. would often be the target of some of these actions. And in fact, it did have effects on public sympathies, sometimes government pressure, but right now the U.S. has abdicated that role entirely. Europe is … Politically, many countries in Europe are in some of the same dangers that we see in the U.S.

And so I think that unfortunately the burden is going to fall even more heavily on us to convince our own fellow people living in the U.S. of what's happening, and that they in fact are going to have to be the ones that help take a stand against this, because we are not going to see it from the billionaires like Peter Thiel, who is already looking for a post-democratic society, to the people like Stephen Miller, who don't want it and never believed in it — I think that the people with the levers of power right now, in many cases, highlighting the gap between the ideal of democracy and what's happening, that is not going to move them.

KH: What concrete moments or battles do you think will determine whether we slide further into entrenched systems or manage to roll them back?

AP: I think there are a few things. I am very much heartened by Minneapolis's response, by L.A.'s response. When there have been people that have been killed, the … I don't want to say “fearlessness” because people, of course, they are afraid. The bravery, the courage with which people have responded to that. I think we've already sort of passed one big hurdle, which is that there was clearly the hope from the government that people could just be intimidated and they would just shut up, that some of this harm would come. And they set up situations, not necessarily that Renee Good was targeted weeks in advance or anything like that. You don't need that to happen. If you create these dynamics, the violence will come. They will have an opportunity. Government agents will have a chance to do this violence. It will happen. And people have responded to that with just greater strength and showing up more for each other.

And I don't want to forget that Chicago is still in the midst of it, that Minneapolis is still taking it in the teeth. It isn't as if getting over those hurdles means that you can kind of sit quietly and be like, “Oh good, that's done.” It's not done. It's still going on. But showing up with that kind of bravery and courage, I think, is something that was a huge test that so far as a country, we are passing and we're going to have to pass it more and more at harder and harder levels, but that's one thing we've already done.

In terms of what's coming up, I think this DHS funding fight is huge. I think we should be pressing on it. I think we should not be letting anyone get away with anything. And I was heartened by Bernie Sanders with the amendment to claw back the $75 billion that had been done and it failed by one vote. Again, I know those are strategic and performative votes in many cases. People know how it's going to play out and they just get a chance to do the vote that will make the least of their constituents angry. But that it was so close, I think, is important. That they had to perform for their constituents does still matter. And that we are seeing [Republican Mississippi] Sen. [Roger] Wicker, for instance, making that call to Kristi Noem and saying, “Hey, we don't want this here.” It's because people laid the groundwork for that and created the pressure for that. And we can do that in more places and it's going to require, in the end, a federal response as well as the local response.

But I think this DHS funding right now is critical. I think that the first facility that we can decommission will be a huge victory. And I think people should be looking strategically about, what is the most vulnerable one, what is the most one where there is visibility and where we can have those stories coming out? There is nothing that beats actually communicating these lives. And I know that people like Pretti and Good, that there's the whole risk of the white savior model and that they get attention that other people don't. But my thought is, “Thank God, at least they still get attention,” and now we need to do the work. 

And by we, I mean as middle-aged white woman, I need to be doing the work so that it is extended, this kind of grace and this kind of sorrow and understanding of the loss is communicated about not just people like Renee Good and Alex Pretti and not just to children like Liam Conejo Ramos, but also to people like Keith Porter Jr. in L.A. We need to be actively humanizing our neighbors. We need to be actively making these stories count in addition to getting them out. And it just — it is in our power to not let people look away. 

It is slow, hard work, but I don't think we get out of this without doing that work. Retaking our communities at the community level — that's going to help create this pressure for the change that's going to have to come at the federal level. And it will come through elections, of course, but it has to come from the grassroots in this case because right now, the government — and this is classically how it happens with concentration camp systems — the executive overpowers and controls the legislative and then tries to eat away at the judiciary.

And so the things we can do to support what's left of Congress in terms of its ability to act and especially the groups that are bringing these cases and arguing them and making some important wins, but out on the streets is the main way, is in community, helping the people and coming into community to come up with the ideas that are going to solve this.

KH: Well, Andrea, I could talk to you all day, but I know we're out of time. I'm so grateful for your insights and for the rigor you bring to this work. These are hard topics, and I really hope the analysis we've shared here today helps our listeners orient themselves a bit amid everything we're up against. I know I found it helpful, and I'm just so glad you could be here.

Larry Johnson, an architectural firm owner, said, “It was just beautiful. I love the performances. There's so much energy and balance and symmetry and beauty. It was more than I could have ever expected. It was tastefully done and yet more than you could ever take in in a single performance. I can't wait to see it again.”

Jason Dailey, a business owner, said, “The choreography is amazing. The performance is really great.”

He also noticed a patented special effect for which Shen Yun is known. “The flips and turns and spins. I think it's unique how they perform on the stage and then transition onto the screen with the videos. It's really unique,” he said.

David Rixham, a communications director of Emmanuel College, said, “The dancing is amazing. The special effects, the song that we were treated to; it's all been an absolutely great experience.”

“Nowadays, when you move, when you see China, people always have a bad mindset about it. But doing this, it opens people's minds to see that China is a beautiful country. It has a beautiful tradition and culture. So it's not about the bad things that are going on there. Before that, China was beautiful, and that is exactly what Shen Yun is doing right now; educating people and telling us what the real China is, all about its beauty,” Jessica Dailey, a special education paraprofessional, said.

Inga Knox, a project manager, said, “The story was so good. And the perception of it [China] ... we're coming from the former Soviet Union, coming from similar countries in terms of how it was perceived. But I really appreciated it.”

Based in New York, Shen Yun has been touring the world since 2006, and has grown to eight different companies. Each performance showcases themes of spirituality and faith, which left a deep impression on theatergoers.

Mr. Rixham said, “To see a message like this and be treated to something like this—from dancers, performers that are in their twenties and thirties—it's just an inspiring thing to see people that want to grow a certain culture and grow a certain faith. So to see something like that is tremendous.”

“The spirituality is definitely there. My mom and I, we are spiritual people. We believe in not so much religion, but spiritual force, strengths, and being, if you will. And I think the show was a really good reminder of that, so we really enjoyed it,” Ms. Knox said.

Mr. Johnson said, “It's important to try to understand all the cultural depictions that are being presented and reflect back upon all the different centuries of history. So it was really meaningful to connect.”

“I think it's wonderful. Music, action, and culture are amazing. Many people, I think, should come and enjoy it. It's a wonderful show and I'm very proud of what they do and what you guys do,” business owner Efendi Atma said.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

 Why Beijing Holds the Power in the Century Ahead

 Carolyn Kissane

Over the past two decades, China has transformed from a strategically weak energy power, dependent on imports of oil and gas, into the world leader in clean energy. Today, China produces the most wind turbines and solar panels, controls nearly every stage of global battery supply chains, exports electric vehicles at prices Western automakers struggle to match, and builds nuclear reactors at a breakneck pace. Even though none of these technologies were discovered in China and none of these industries originated there, the country has become the market maker and dominant player for each one. In other words, by commanding the systems that electrify modern economies, China is on its way toward achieving energy dominance.

U.S. President Donald Trump does not see it that way. He instead defines energy dominance more narrowly, in terms of fossil fuel production. Steeped in the oil crises of the 1970s and inspired by the U.S. shale revolution in the first decade of this century—which made the United States the world's largest oil and gas producer—the president has focused on increasing oil, natural gas, and coal production at home and in the Western hemisphere, as the U.S. foray into Venezuela this January illustrated. Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council by executive order in February 2025 to expand the domestic fossil fuel industry and parse which clean technologies to stick with and which to drop.

But this is an outdated conception. Global demand for electricity is rising and will likely accelerate as economies electrify transport, industry, and households. Artificial intelligence and machine learning—plus the data centers and advanced manufacturing that drive it—are making modern economies increasingly energy intensive. Military systems, meanwhile, are shifting from fuel-guzzling fighter jets and aircraft carriers to battery-powered drones and undersea vehicles, as well as into data-heavy cyberwarfare. Global demand for oil continues to grow, but it is projected to plateau in the early 2030s as efficiency gains and electrification reshape consumption.

The United States is still mostly self-reliant on its own energy sources. Natural gas remains the backbone of U.S. electricity generation and will supply most of the power to American data centers. But as electricity demand surges, energy dominance will depend less on what lies underground than on the infrastructure that contributes to it—turbines, transmission lines, transformers, and grid interconnections—much of which is now built on Chinese tech. Already, the United States' electricity infrastructure deficits are inhibiting its race to artificial general intelligence and leaving it surprisingly dependent on Chinese-controlled supply chains, such as grid equipment, solar panels, and storage systems.

Beijing, by contrast, has spent nearly two decades preparing for precisely this landscape. It did so, in large part, by treating energy and electrification as central components of national strength, rather than a standalone industry or a narrow climate issue. It devised a long-sighted strategy that fused manufacturing, technological innovation, and national security. The guiding principle has been consistent: build domestic power and reduce external dependence. China's dominance in renewables now underpins its growing influence over global electrification, infrastructure, and industrial development, especially in the so-called global South. And it reflects a deeper understanding of where the world will move once AI and machine learning become the predominant elements of economic strength and global competitiveness.

This energy dominance with Chinese characteristics matters to the United States. Not only are many of these technologies and materials critical for global military and economic supremacy, Beijing has already demonstrated its willingness to use its technology and mineral-processing capabilities as leverage over Washington. It also sets the pace, price, and scale of clean energy systems that electrify economies worldwide, and it is diversifying them away from oil. Today, China is indispensable to the global energy economy not because alternatives do not exist, but because few competitors can match it.

Power accrues not only to those who produce energy but to those who build, finance, integrate, and expand energy systems. By that definition, China, not the United States, is most successfully practicing a policy of energy dominance. Washington has the resources, capital, and technology to lead in electrification and energy infrastructure, but by prioritizing fossil fuel exports over broader system development, it is losing the energy competition.

Since Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he has been committed to reducing China's reliance on legacy industries and to securing its lead in new energy technologies. This is not climate altruism: as Amy Myers Jaffe argued in Foreign Affairs in 2018, China's move to clean energy was a strategy of power politics by other means, designed to limit vulnerability to U.S. dominance over oil and gas and the U.S. Navy's control of sea-lanes surrounding the Middle East. But what started as an attempt to secure China's economic growth against external shocks has evolved into a formula for economic success—and power over the United States.

Beijing's success is often chalked up to scale and subsidies. Although this is part of the story—China was able to flood global markets with artificially cheap wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles—it ignores the strategic coherence and innovations that Beijing adopted along the way. Indeed, China has integrated these industries into a single, tightly coordinated ecosystem capable of setting global standards.



China recognized early on that electrification technologies have a distinct advantage over hydrocarbons, which are geographically dispersed. To capitalize on this, it located manufacturing of raw materials, intermediate components, and finished products in the same places, often within a few hours of one another. This supply chain density lowers costs, accelerates production, and allows Chinese firms to outcompete others on both speed and price. Major data-center developers are now trying to do something similar in the United States by creating vertically integrated energy and infrastructure ecosystems that are physically close to one another.

China's supply chain density was also the result of deliberate regional coordination, sustained investment in infrastructure, and a willingness to tolerate excess capacity, knowing that a large market lay beyond the country's borders. Because Beijing treated clean energy manufacturing as a strategic industry, it offered subsidies while also channeling capital into research, industrial parks, grid infrastructure, and workforce development. Innovation was scaled alongside production, allowing new technologies to move rapidly from the laboratory to the factory floor. Firms competed fiercely for scale and efficiency; many failed, and consolidation was ruthless. But the ecosystem as a whole became more competitive.

This model transformed domestic deployment into global leverage. China's massive buildout at home drove domestic costs down, and its export capacity ensured its technologies could reach markets where demand was rising fastest and capital was scarce. Starting a decade ago, China could offer low-cost, fast-deploying clean energy technology at a scale others couldn't match. A Chinese solar panel costs approximately 30–40 percent less than its Western equivalent; a Chinese electric vehicle is half as much as an American or European model.

This makes Chinese tech particularly attractive for much of the developing world, where governments are seeking affordable, reliable power now, not aspirational pledges with extended timelines. Their need for fast results is particularly acute in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, when global natural gas prices spiked and revealed the folly of relying on fossil fuels. India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, to name just a few countries, experienced widespread blackouts that made pivoting to Chinese-manufactured solar panels a logical alternative. And once the panels were in place, the cost and supply of solar energy were domestic and fixed.



China has also moved beyond supplying individual components to delivering entire energy systems, complete with generation, transmission, storage, and grid modernization—and often bundled with financing and long-term maintenance. In Kenya, for instance, Chinese firms have built solar farms and grid extensions. In Pakistan, Chinese-produced solar panels generate gigawatts of renewable power. Across Latin America, Chinese companies are modernizing transmission networks. Beijing already owns or operates more than ten percent of Brazil's electricity infrastructure, with similar stakes expanding elsewhere in the global South. The result is not simply leadership in clean energy but influence over how electrification unfolds worldwide.

China's energy strategy has been so successful that it formalized this system-level approach with the adoption of the Energy Law in late 2024. Unlike earlier legislation that governed discrete subsectors—coal, oil and gas, nuclear, and renewables—this law treats energy as an integrated strategic domain. Energy security, industrial development, technological innovation, and market structure are now addressed within a unified legal and policy framework. Central authorities coordinate planning, regulate emerging technologies, and align industrial goals with energy-security objectives.

Most notably, the organizing principle for this new system is expansion, not substitution. Although the law includes mandates for the accelerated deployment of solar, wind, nuclear, and hydrogen energy, as well as energy storage, it also affirms the continued centrality of fossil fuels. Coal, oil, and gas are framed not as legacy resources to be displaced but as foundations to be optimized. The law elevates grid expansion and modernization as national planning priorities in order to build capacity and strengthen the resilience of fossil fuel systems. It also recognizes coal's integral role in system stability and supports oil and gas exploration and production to reduce external vulnerabilities. This coexistence is not a contradiction. By preserving its options across fuels while expanding capacity, China has built an energy system designed to absorb shocks, support industrial growth, power new technologies, and give it leverage over other countries.

The success of China's energy strategy was visible in 2025. Renewed trade tensions with Beijing, for instance, reminded Washington how dependent American industries were on Chinese-controlled supply chains of critical minerals and energy technologies, and how dangerous those chokepoints could be for U.S. defense systems and advanced manufacturing. The United States still spent that year celebrating its rising oil and gas exports under the banner of “energy dominance.” But the larger global supply drove down crude prices, allowing China to amass substantial fuel reserves at a low cost. In an oversupplied market, Beijing's diversified import base and accumulated stockpiles cushion it from disruptions, including the potential loss of Venezuelan oil.

As outlined in its most recent five-year plan, Beijing is extending the same state-coordinated industrial strategy that propelled its rise in clean energy manufacturing into emerging sectors such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and robotics. The objective is not simply participation but leadership by anchoring next-generation technologies in domestic supply chains and scaling them before global competitors can catch up. The United States will benefit from its role as an oil and gas supplier for decades to come, but China will erode its competitor's technological edge. U.S. firms still dominate AI models and chip design, but scaling those operations depends on U.S. grids that remain fragmented, aging, and contested. The United States has the resources, capital, and innovative capacity to compete, yet political disagreements have prevented it from adopting a workable strategy. Before it is too late, U.S. energy and critical-mineral policies must be redefined around integration and innovation rather than simply raw extraction. Washington will have far more success embracing opportunities across oil, natural gas, nuclear, renewables, and batteries than by focusing strictly on fossil fuels.



Trump's National Energy Dominance Council, however, has prioritized short-term export influence in hydrocarbons over long-term technological leadership. It is still pushing geothermal, advanced nuclear, and battery innovation, but it has slashed federal backing for large-scale solar and wind deployment, electric vehicle incentives, and grid modernization—the very sectors driving global electrification. By limiting the scale and scope of these industries, the United States risks losing international technological leadership. Energy systems, manufacturing, and artificial intelligence, after all, are converging.

The United States must pair its natural resource endowment with sustained investment in innovation, manufacturing, and global partnerships to restore its technological advantage. The irony of the current moment is that the administration most vocal in its commitment to “energy dominance” has pursued policies that make it less attainable. By defining dominance narrowly around fossil fuels and retreating from the technologies that electrify economies, Washington is ceding the terrain on which twenty-first-century power is being built. Dominance will belong to the country that can supply both the energy that powers economies and the infrastructure that supports them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump administration expands ICE's ability to detain legal refugees in latest memo","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/politics/trump-refugees-memo-detain-immigration-hnk","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:38:01 GMT","


            The Department of Homeland Security is broadening federal immigration authorities' ability to detain legal refugees who have not yet obtained green cards, citing national security concerns and the need to ensure refugees undergo additional screening, according to a DHS memo obtained by CNN.
    


            Immigration officers may “arrest and detain” refugees “who have failed to adjust” to lawful permanent resident status one year after being admitted to the US, according to the Wednesday memo, which was submitted by Justice Department attorneys as part of a federal court filing.
    


            “When a refugee is admitted to the United States, the admission is conditional and subject to a mandatory review after one year,” the memo reads, noting refugees who are detained may remain in custody “for the duration of the inspection and examination process.”
    


            The memo, issued by US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow and Acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, rescinds previous government policy regarding refugees who have been in the country for one year.
    


            Failure to obtain a green card after one year was not grounds for detention or removal from the US under previous policy, and refugees who were arrested had to either be released within 48 hours or the DHS was required to initiate removal proceedings.
    


            “Refugees may be considered to have voluntarily returned to custody” by submitting application paperwork and appearing at scheduled appointments with immigration services, according to the new memo.
    


Cancelled citizenship ceremonies and interviews are another part of Trump's immigration crackdown



            Previous department policy “created a population of conditional refugees who had not been fully re-screened, with associated public safety and national security risks,” the memo says, and the new “detain-and-inspect requirement ensures that refugees are re-vetted after one year.”
    


            Refugee resettlement groups promptly decried the new policy.
    


            “This memo was done in secret, with zero coordination with the organizations that serve refugees,” said Beth Oppenheim, CEO of refugee agency HIAS. “This policy is a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the US government itself welcomed after years of extreme vetting,” she added.
    


            The government court filing that included the DHS memo is part of a federal case in Minnesota in which a judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from targeting an estimated 5,600 lawful refugees in the state who are awaiting green cards. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
    


            The International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the federal Minnesota case, says it is challenging the new refugee policy.
    


            “This memo is part of a broad and concerted effort to strip refugees of their legal status and render them deportable,” said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of US Legal Programs at IRAP. “This government will clearly stop at nothing to terrorize refugee communities, and really all immigrants, while trampling over our constitutional rights.”
    


            CNN has reached out to DHS, USCIS and ICE for comment.
    


            President Donald Trump has largely halted refugee admissions during his second term – with the narrow exception of White South Africans – amid his administration's broader crackdown on illegal immigration. Last fall, the Trump administration set the number of annual refugee admissions at 7,500 – a fraction of what the US has historically allowed. In 2024, more than 100,000 refugees were admitted.
    


            In November, the administration moved to reinterview some refugees admitted under President Joe Biden, and the killing of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, by an Afghan national that month prompted the administration to re-examine green cards issued to people from Afghanistan and 18 other countries “of concern.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","With no initial DNA match, Guthrie investigators turn to one of their newest tools to crack cases: genetic genealogy","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/us/nancy-guthrie-genetic-genealogy-dna","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:00:35 GMT","


            Only a few years ago, Tuesday's announcement that a glove believed to be connected to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie in Tucson, Arizona, had no match in a DNA database would have been a dead end. Now for investigators, it is just the beginning.
    


            “Investigators are currently looking into additional investigative genetic genealogy options for DNA evidence to check for matches,” the Pima County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday.
    


            That brings a whole new dimension to unlocking the secret of gloves found 2 miles from Guthrie's home, said by investigators to be similar to those worn by a suspect in a disturbing video caught on a camera at Guthrie's front door.
    


 Separate DNA found at Guthrie's property that does not match her or anyone “in close contact with her” also has not produced a match in the national law enforcement DNA database known as CODIS, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News Tuesday. 



            Comparing DNA collected in criminal investigations to publicly accessible databases of millions of people who have contributed genetic profiles – and thereby finding often distant relatives to piece together a family tree that can point to a suspect – has been a component of a number of recent cases, including the conviction of Bryan Kohberger, who ultimately confessed to murdering four college students in Idaho and was sentenced in life in prison.
    


Here are the key developments in the weekslong search for Nancy Guthrie



            “From that, we get a list of people who share DNA with that unknown person. It can be as little as 1%, or even less,” genetic genealogy expert CeCe Moore told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


            While there have been seemingly miraculous results from sifting through millions of DNA records based on a single sample, the process is still hit-or-miss and may not bring the Guthrie family the answers they want right away.
    


            “It can go as quickly as 20 minutes … and I have some cases I've been working on for seven-and-a-half years,” Moore said.
    


            Successfully using the DNA of distant family members to profile and narrow down suspects had an extraordinarily high-profile debut in 2018, when it was used to solve the cold case of the Golden State Killer.
    


            After authorities spent five decades fruitlessly searching for a suspect in dozens of murders and rapes across California, an investigator decided to put crime scene DNA – believed to be the perpetrator's – into GEDmatch, a public database where people voluntarily upload their DNA data for genealogy research.
    


            It took only four months to identify possible relatives and narrow the search for possible suspects to just three people. One of them, former police officer Joseph DeAngelo, had been part of a task force investigating the Golden State Killer.
    


            “We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations,” lead prosecutor Thien Ho told CNN last year.
    


            He was 72 years old when he was caught and had never previously been a suspect.
    


            DeAngelo – now 80 years old – was convicted in 2020 and is serving a sentence of life without parole.
    


            Since then, the technology has been used to identify more than just suspects in ongoing criminal cases. The identity of a victim of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, for example, was discovered through DNA genealogy, determining he was a veteran of World War I.
    


            In the Kohberger case, investigators acknowledged the FBI used DNA from a a knife sheath found at the crime scene in a genetic investigation. Genetic genealogy “pointed law enforcement toward” Kohberger as a suspect, prosecutors said, though investigators ultimately did not use that evidence to obtain the arrest warrant, saying they had enough other evidence including surveillance video and cell phone data to link him to the killings.
    


            Even in genetic genealogy's biggest success stories, scouring DNA records narrowed down the suspects, but did not directly solve the crime. In the Golden State Killer case, once police had their eyes on DeAngelo, the definitive link was established only by following the suspect to a Hobby Lobby store, where they swabbed his car door handle when he wasn't looking. Later, when rifling through his trash, a single piece of tissue proved DeAngelo's DNA and the long-sought killer's were one and the same.
    


            The method of using DNA records that were primarily intended for family research and genetic curiosity as part of a criminal investigation is barely a decade old, and privacy concerns about how that incredibly personal information can be used are the biggest hurdles to its use.
    


            Privacy concerns about using massive DNA databases in law enforcement investigations continue – especially for services that exist mostly to satisfy people's personal curiosity about their heritage. The three largest commercial providers of DNA products – 23andMe, AncestryDNA and MyHeritage – generally prohibit law enforcement access to their genetic data and would release it only if compelled by a warrant or court order.
    


            23andMe adds it has only received 11 requests from law enforcement over a decade-long period and has so far never given up a person's DNA data to investigators without the person's consent.
    


            “We can sometimes get lucky and get a closer relative, but because we are limited to the two smallest genetic genealogy databases, we only are able to compare against less than 2 million profiles,” Moore said.
    


            Those databases – GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA – are open-source services where people are informed that the information could be used by law enforcement.
    


            Moore is CEO of a third database, DNA Justice, that exists specifically to make DNA information available to law enforcement investigations. It has fewer than 7,000 DNA records.
    


            Besides the reluctance of many people to share their own DNA profile for investigations, the success rate also depends on people's willingness to have their DNA catalogued at all. Those records exist more for Americans with western European ancestry than other backgrounds, according to Moore.
    


            “You're mostly seeing White people with deep roots in the United States,” she said.
    


            With the many complications involved in collecting DNA evidence – and time seeming to be a major enemy of finding Guthrie safe and sound – Moore said the Guthrie family could plead for more access to records from the top genealogy websites that have been very reluctant to take part.
    


            “I don't believe they will allow it unless they are served with a warrant, and then I think there's going to be a knock-down, drag-out fight,” she said.

            The United States may be on the cusp of launching military action that would mark the most decisive moment in its near half-century showdown with Iran.
    


            Yet there's little public debate about what could be a weekslong assault with consequences that are impossible to predict.
    


            There's no full-court press from top national security officials. President Donald Trump is making hardly any effort to share the rationale for the potential or why military personnel might be asked to risk their lives. And the White House is giving no public sign that it knows what may unfold in Iran if its clerical regime is toppled, an eventuality that could cause enormous reverberations in the Middle East.
    


The president has made no final decision either way, sources told CNN.
    


            But every day, and following the failure of his tepid diplomacy to make breakthroughs so far, Trump is being dragged inexorably closer to a fateful decision point. The military has told the White House that it could be ready to launch an attack by the weekend, following a buildup of aerial and naval assets, CNN reported. But one source said that the president has privately argued for and against action and has polled advisers and allies on what he should do.
    


            Given the stakes, and the potential risk to American personnel, the lack of a specific public rationale for any war with Iran seems surprising.
    


            This narrative deficit was reflected in the White House briefing Wednesday, ironically on the eve of the first meeting of the president's Board of Peace. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked the pertinent question of why Trump might need to launch a strike on Iran's nuclear program, which he has insisted he already totally obliterated in a round-the-world bombing raid last year.
    


            “Well, there's many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,” Leavitt said, offering no specifics.
    


            Trump's explanations extend only to repeated warnings that Iran will face the consequences if it doesn't make a “deal” with the United States. Last week, he said regime change in Tehran might be the “best thing” that could happen.
    


            Ordering the military into battle is the most somber duty of presidents. Their assumption of the highest office comes with an obligation to explain why force might be necessary. And fuzzy thinking could imperil the mission.
    


            Leavitt implied that Americans should just trust the president. “He's always thinking about what's in the best interests of the United States of America, of our military, of the American people,” she said.
    


            This would be a thin foundation on which to launch a major war that might end up costing billions of dollars and unknown numbers of American and Iranian lives, and that could trigger huge military and economic repercussions in the Middle East.
    


            It could also worsen Trump's already stark domestic unpopularity in a midterm election year.
    


            Trump wouldn't like any comparison with the Iraq war that began in 2003, given its disastrous aftermath. But before that conflict, the Bush administration spent months in a PR offensive designed to convince the country of its later-debunked rationale for the war. It also managed to win congressional authorization for the invasion — at least securing a domestic legal basis for its actions.
    


            If Trump persists in failing to level with citizens and Congress and then takes military action, he will be prolonging a trend of his second term. And he will be leaving himself politically exposed in the event that strikes go wrong.
    


            But it also appears that Trump is emboldened by his successful ouster of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro in a spectacular operation last month that killed no US troops. His tolerance for risk may also be heightened because the US assassination of Iranian military and intelligence chief Qasem Soleimani in his first term failed to trigger the kind of regional conflagration and Iranian attacks on US allies that some experts predicted.
    


            In recent weeks, Trump's strategy on Iran has seemed to mirror his playbook in Venezuela, where he amassed a huge naval armada and demanded concessions. This is 21st-century diplomacy backed by aircraft carrier groups and cruise missiles.
    


            But he risks creating a box for himself that it will be difficult to exit with credibility intact if it turns out that his repeated claims that Iran wants a “deal” are wrong.
    


            The kind of deal that Trump can offer Iran may be unacceptable to its clerical regime, whose top priority is perpetuating itself. And a deal Tehran could offer Trump may be one he'd never accept, since it doesn't want to talk about its ballistic missiles or regional proxy network, which he sees as red lines.
    


            Iranian concessions on a nuclear program that is already severely disrupted in return for sanctions relief would be unacceptable to Trump. He can't afford politically to emulate the nuclear deal agreed by the Obama administration that he trashed. And lifting sanctions could help the regime survive. 



            The New York Times quoted Iranian sources as saying that Iran has indicated willingness to suspend enrichment for three to five years in return for sanctions relief. But Dennis Ross, a former US Middle East peace envoy, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that this was a symbolic concession. “It's pretty hard to see them enriching while Trump is still in office. And what they're seeking is the lifting of economic sanctions, which is a way of … giving them a kind of lease on life.”
    


            The White House may not be telling Americans why it might be time to go to war with Iran. But that doesn't mean there are not strategic rationales for doing so. In that sense, Leavitt is right.
    


            Trump's obsession with naming buildings after himself and erecting new ones — such as the planned White House ballroom — suggest he's increasingly preoccupied with his legacy.
    


            Ending the often-hot cold war with Iran that has bedeviled every American president since Jimmy Carter would secure him a true place in history. And it could put a historic capstone on an estrangement with revolutionary Iran that began with the humiliation of Americans held hostage in 1979-81, which scarred US global confidence and prestige.
    


            Trump might never get a better opening. The regime has arguably never been weaker. Its regional proxies, like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — which were once an insurance policy against an outside attack — have been shredded by Israel.
    


            Iran's government is facing its worst-ever domestic crisis. It's clouded by doubt over the revolutionary succession after 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dies. The economy is wrecked. Desperation recently drove protesters onto the streets amid food and water shortages and grinding economic conditions. The resulting crackdown may have killed thousands. Trump could make good on his pledge to protesters that the US was “locked and loaded” to defend them by toppling the clerical regime.
    


            While Iran may not pose an immediate deadly threat to the US, it has killed scores of Americans in terror attacks and through militias during the Iraq war. Its leaders have long threatened to wipe Israel off the map — a threat that would become even more grave with nuclear weapons. And a stable, democratic and unthreatening Iran would boost the emergence of a new Middle East, powered by the growing global influence of US allies in the Gulf.
    


            Trump would, of course, be a hero of Iranians if he delivered them from repression.
    


            But there are many reasons why he might be smart to blink.
    


            A serious attempt either to decapitate the Iranian regime or to devastate the military capacity of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij paramilitary militia would likely require a multi-day air campaign. This could lead to significant civilian casualties. It would raise the possibility of US combat deaths or the capture of US pilots, which could turn into a propaganda disaster.
    


            While some critics have pointed to Trump's vows to wage no new wars in the Middle East, an Iran conflict would likely not lead to the kind of massive land invasion that turned Iraq into a morass. But as in that war, the best day for the US might be the one when it fires its first shock-and-awe volleys.
    


            It's also unlikely that any strike against Iran's clerical leaders would be as clean as the special forces mission that spirited Maduro out of Venezuela.
    


            There is also the problem of what might come next if the revolutionary government were to fall. Failing to anticipate the day after haunted US regime change efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya this century.
    


            “My question is, after all is said and done, if this lasts for weeks, what happens next?” Colin Clarke, executive director of the Soufan Center told Isa Soares on CNN International. “Then you're dealing with a power vacuum, then you're dealing with the potential for insurgency. And, you know there's a range of states and non-state actors that would look to exploit that.”
    


            Iran, the seat of the ancient Persian civilization, is less plagued by sectarian divides than Iraq, which splintered after the US invasion. But the loss of central authority might be devastating. And the lack of a coherent umbrella leadership for protesters or organized internal opposition raises further questions about a smooth transition. Any US and Israeli joint military action would be certain to include wide-ranging attacks on IRGC facilities and forces. But sources told CNN this week that US intelligence community still believes that the most likely candidate to fill a leadership void would be the hardline guard corps. So ousting theocrats in Tehran might just lead to an equally radical anti-US replacement.
    


            And longer and more complex military action in Iran than in Venezuela with uncertain consequences would increase political pressure on Trump at home amid multiple polls showing majorities of Americans oppose a new Middle East war. It could also test Trump's bond with the MAGA movement, since he's spent the last 10 years telling his base there will be no more foreign quagmires.
    


            While officials said that forces would be positioned to strike Iran at the weekend, US action is not guaranteed. The start of the Muslim holy month Ramadan could augur a delay. So could Trump's annual State of the Union address Tuesday. Trump prizes the unpredictable, so Iran will be on full alert.
    


            But unless Iran capitulates to terms that Trump is still yet to fully explain to the public, more time will not ease the most fateful dilemma yet of his second term.

President Donald Trump opens Board of Peace meeting in Washington, calling it “one of the most important” things he's done. At the same time, he called out major US allies who have not yet joined the Board of Peace, saying “they're playing cute.”

President Donald Trump announced Thursday at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting that nine members have agreed to pledge a combined $7 billion toward a Gaza relief package, while five countries have agreed to deploy troops to take part in an international stabilization force to the war-battered Palestinian territory.

But $7 billion is only a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild Gaza, where a shaky ceasefire deal looms over Trump's ambitions for his board to rival the United Nations in solving world conflicts.

Trump also announced the U.S. was pledging $10 billion for the Board of Peace but didn't specify what the money will be used for.

Instead, the president is turning his focus to domestic issues: In an hour, he'll arrive in Georgia for a trip designed to help boost Republicans' political standing heading into the midterms.

What to know:

It wasn't only heads of state who offered major contributions to Trump's Board of Peace.

FIFA president Giovanni Infantino outlined a new plan by the world's governing body of football — “soccer” for those who live in the U.S. — to bring new sports opportunities to war-torn Gaza.

“We don't have to rebuild houses or schools or hospitals or roads,” Infantino said. “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about.”

Specifically, FIFA pledged to spend $50 million for a national football stadium in Gaza to hold between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators in addition to a FIFA academy at a cost of $15 million. The organization also vowed to build 50 “FIFA arena mini pitches” and five full-sized pitches at a total cost of $7.5 million.

Workers are restoring an exhibit depicting the history of the nine people once enslaved in Philadelphia amid a legal fight between the city and the Trump Administration.

Mayor Cherelle Parker visited the site Thursday morning and saw the work being done, spokesperson Joe Grace said.

A federal judge had set a Friday deadline for the Interior Department to restore the exhibit on the people enslaved by George Washington at the former President's House on Independence Mall.

Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe issued the deadline Wednesday even as the Justice Department appeals her order to reinstate the exhibit.

In the last of several statements made about the United Nations, Trump ended his inaugural meeting Thursday by hinting that the U.S. -- the world body's largest donor -- will be making more changes to the institution, including to the appearance of its headquarters in New York.

Many world leaders and diplomats have been worried that Trump's new initiative was an attempt to eclipse the U.N. Security Council. But Trump attempted to assuage those concerns, saying that the U.S. will “work again with the United Nations and, bring it back to health.”

He added that his administration plans to “fix up even the building.”

“I like to see beautiful buildings. I like to see buildings fixed up physically, not look like they are in disrepair,” Trump said. “We don't like that. So we're going to do a job with the United Nations.”

Billionaire investor Marc Rowan, a member of the Board of Peace's executive committee, said reconstruction would begin in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.

He said 100,000 homes for 500,000 people, about a quarter of Gaza's population, were initially planned, along with $5 billion of infrastructure. He said “over time,” 400,000 new homes for Gaza's entire population were planned, with $30 billion in infrastructure projects.

He gave no timeline for when construction would begin.

“This is not a problem of money or collateral,” he said. “This is a problem of peace.”

In an hourslong meeting, leaders from various countries, including Peru, Bahrain and Pakistan, spent most of their speaking time praising Trump and what they called his “unprecedented” ability to end conflicts around the world.

Pakistan called him the “savior of South Asia,” while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the last year. 

The glowing remarks that went around from each corner of the globe resembled the same format and tone of Trump's Cabinet meetings, which involve less policy substance and more adulation for the Republican president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his pledge that Gaza will not be rebuilt until Hamas disarms.

“We agreed with our friends in the United States: There will be no reconstruction of the Gaza Strip before the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip,” he said in a speech to graduating officers at an army base in southern Israel.

“Soon, Hamas will face a dilemma: disarm the easy way — or disarm the hard way. But it will be disarmed, and Gaza will no longer threaten Israel.”

Iran held annual military drills with Russia on Thursday as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East, with both the United States and Iran signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran's nuclear program fizzle out.

Trump said he hopes to reach a deal with Iran, but the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.

Iran's theocracy is more vulnerable than ever, following 12 days of Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites and military last year, as well as mass protests in January that were violently suppressed. But it is still capable of striking Israel and U.S. bases, and has warned that any attack would trigger a regional war.

Despite repeatedly underscoring the importance of preventing and ending conflict, Trump made several pointed remarks during his Board of Peace meeting directed at Iran as the U.S. has amassed a significant military in the region.

The Republican president stood in front of many of the same regional allies who have pressured the U.S. in the last few weeks to not take military action against Iran and once again warned its longtime adversary to come to the table with an acceptable deal or face the consequences.

“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

The inaugural meeting of Trump's Board of Peace comes perhaps ironically at a time of high tension between the United States and Iran and one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the Middle East in decades, with one aircraft carrier group in the region already and another on the way.

The military moves have coincided with the series of threats Trump has made to Iran if it does not accede to his demands to denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding extremist proxy groups.

Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly-created International Stabilization Force, announced that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have all pledged troops to the effort. In addition, Egypt and Jordan, which border the Gaza strip, have agreed to train the police and security forces.

“With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace,” Jeffers said.

— This item has been corrected to show that Jeffers is a major general, not a general, and is not retired.

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved Trump's proposal, despite raising concerns at the panel's January meeting. Some commissioners had questioned the lead architect about its “immense” design and scale, roughly twice the size of the White House itself.

Trump's demolition of the East Wing prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction. And the project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, now led by one of Trump's top aides.

— CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert erroneously reported that the vote was unanimous; one commissioner abstained.

The vice president nodded to domestic politics heading into the midterm elections in his brief statement to the board. 

“The reason that we're here today is yes to save lives and yes to promote peace, but this creates incredible prosperity for the American people,” Vance said.

He said the countries represented on the board represent “trillions of dollars of investment” in the U.S., and support millions of American jobs by buying goods made in America.

The direct line between the Board of Peace and the U.S. economy is not completely clear. Trump's trade war has strained economic relations with several major U.S. allies.

The Republican president repeated his concerns and criticism of the United Nations during his Board of Peace meeting, saying the UN should have been more involved in conflict-solving than it has been.

But, Trump also said that the U.S. is going “to be working with the United Nations very close.”

“Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be, I think, is going to be much stronger,” he said. “The Board of Peace is gonna almost be looking over the United Nations, and making sure it runs properly.”

Trump also announced the U.S. is pledging $10 billion for the Board of Peace, but didn't specify what the money will be used for.

“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” Trump said.

CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert erroneously reported that the vote was unanimous; one commissioner abstained.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait are the countries that are making pledges, Trump said.

“But every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” said Trump in thanking the donors.

The amount, while significant, represents a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of war.

Shouting out all of the various conflicts he says he solved, Trump mentioned that Iran is “a hotspot right now.” He said his envoys have had “very interesting” meetings with Iranian officials. 

His positive comments come as the two adversaries have leaned into gunboat diplomacy in recent weeks, with nuclear talks between the nations hanging in the balance, Tehran holding drills with Russia and the Americans bringing another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast.

“It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

Trump is fueling the rivalry between the two members of his administration considered the frontrunners to replace him as the GOP's next presidential nominee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.

Trump described Vance as “a fantastic man” and a “fantastic talent” before running through the highlights of the vice president's education and marriage and noting that Vance “gets a little bit tough on occasion.”

The president then pivoted to Rubio, calling his leadership style “the opposite extreme. ... Marco does it with a velvet glove, but it's a kill.”

Trump then praised Rubio's performance at the Munich Security Conference this week, joking that if he did his job any better he'd be fired for outshining him.

Much can change in the two years before voters pick the GOP's 2028 presidential nominee. The Constitution bars Trump from seeking a third term.

A week after Trump blasted him as a RINO, short for Republican In Name Only, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt struck a conciliatory tone toward the White House.

“Politics is tough,” Stitt said Thursday at an event sponsored by Politico at the outset of the National Governors Association's annual meeting. “Politics has a way of just beating you down over time so I can't imagine being president of the United States. He's got a tough job to do.”

Stitt is the president of the NGA this year. The group, made up of governors from both parties, is typically one of the few bipartisan organizations to convene in Washington each year.

But this year's meeting has been defined by tensions as Trump has refused to invite two Democratic governors to a business meeting at the White House. Trump said Stitt mischaracterized his position.

Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the driving force behind renaming the U.S. Institute of Peace the “Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace,” in a move still being contested in courts.

“Marco named it after me,” Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace at the former USIP building. Trump said it was a surprise. Rubio is not known to have played a significant role in the renaming, although the State Department is the current custodian.

The USIP was created as an independent entity by Congress in 1984, a status Trump sought to revoke last year when the building was seized from its leadership and nearly all of its employees fired. The changes remain subject to litigation.

In one of many tangents, Trump used his speech at the Board of Peace meeting to reinforce his support for various foreign leaders who are facing or were recently facing a contested election in their country. Many of the endorsements are part of Trump's pattern of embracing autocratic leaders who are part of a global pushback against democratic traditions.

“I'm not supposed to be endorsing people, but I endorse, when I like people. You know, I've had a very good record of endorsing candidates within the United States, but now I endorse foreign leaders, including Viktor Orbán, who's here,” Trump said, mentioning also Milei and the prime minister of Japan.

While Trump convenes his Board of Peace, the nation's governors also are gathering in Washington. Their annual gathering has traditionally been a show of bipartisanship. Trump disrupted norms by not inviting all governors to meetings at the White House. 

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, joined Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, both Republicans, in opening this year's National Governors Association on a panel where they emphasized bipartisanship, regardless of Trump's actions. 

The break with tradition reflects Trump's broader approach in his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some state leaders, withholding federal funds from states that draw his ire and deploying federal troops to cities over the objections of local officials.

Despite the presence Thursday of dozens of world leaders, Trump noted that many countries — including the U.K., France and Canada — have chosen to not yet accept the invitation to the Board of Peace.

“Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be. And some are playing a little cute — it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me,” Trump said. “But, this is the most prestigious board ever put together.”

In his opening remarks, Trump welcomes the dozens of world leaders in attendance and says many of them have become “incredible friends of mine.”

“Board of Peace is one of the most important and consequential things, I think, that I'll be involved in,” the second-term president said.

Trump and other world leaders have arrived at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.

Flanked by Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump stood in front of leaders from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Qatar, among others, to take a group photo before discussing the various parts of the president's peace plan for Gaza.

A number of world leaders, including Argentina's Javier Milei, Hungary's Viktor Orbán and others carried red hats with the emblem “USA” and an American flag on the side, and put them on the tables next to their country signs.

The new research tied to one of America's leading banks provides more evidence that Trump‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.

The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses Trump had promised to revive — have had to absorb the new expense by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.

“That's a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis on Thursday.

The research adds to a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration's claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that “at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations.” 

The Trump administration on Wednesday pushed back: “This president has a very bold and ambitious plan and vision to rebuild and reconstruct Gaza, which is well underway because of the Board of Peace,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This is a legitimate organization where there are tens of member countries from around the world.”

And Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the board is “not talking, it is doing.”

“We are hearing the chattering class criticizing the structure of the board, that it's unconventional, that it's unprecedented,” Waltz said. “Again, the old ways were not working.”

Trump said this week he hopes the board would push the U.N. to “get on the ball.”

“The United Nations has great potential,” he said. “They haven't lived up to the potential.”

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is one of two federal panels reviewing the president's plans to build a ballroom twice the size of the White House itself on the site of the former East Wing.

The commission, now led by Trump's appointees, is scheduled to further discuss the project at its monthly meeting on Thursday, held over Zoom.

At last month's meeting, some of those commissioners questioned the architect about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed the president's vision for the massive expansion.

The U.S. trade deficit slipped modestly in 2025 as Trump upended global commerce by slapping double digit tariffs on imports from most countries.

The gap the between the goods and services the U.S. sells other countries and what it buys from them narrowed to just over $901 billion from $904 billion in 2024, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 

Exports rose 6% last year, and imports rose nearly 5%. The trade gap surged from January-March as U.S. companies tried to import foreign goods ahead of Trump's taxes, then narrowed most of the rest of the year.

Trump's tariffs are a tax paid by U.S. importers and often passed along to their customers as higher prices. But they haven't had as much impact on inflation as economists originally expected. Trump argues that the tariffs will protect U.S. industries, bringing manufacturing back to America and raising money for the U.S. Treasury.

Members of the United Nations Security Council are calling for Gaza ceasefire deal to become permanent, and blasting Israeli efforts to expand control in the West Bank as a threat to prospects of a two-state solution. They met Wednesday on the eve of Trump's first Board of Peace gathering to discuss the future of the Palestinian territories.

The high-level U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same day, complicating travel plans for diplomats. It is a sign of the potential for overlapping and conflicting agendas between the United Nations' most powerful body and Trump's broader ambitions to broker global conflicts, which have raised concerns in some countries that it may attempt to rival the U.N. Security Council.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a panel made up of President Donald Trump's appointees, on Thursday approved his proposal to build a ballroom larger than the White House itself where the East Wing once stood. 

The meeting was supposed to be on the design, with a final vote expected at next month's session. But the chairman, Rodney Mims Cook Jr., made a motion to also vote on final approval, and six of the seven commissioners who were all installed by the Republican president since the start of the year voted in favor twice. One commissioner, James McCrery, did not vote because he was the initial architect on the project. 

“Our sitting president has actually designed a very beautiful structure,” Cook said before the voting. “The United States just should not be entertaining the world in tents.” 

Cook echoed one of Trump's arguments for adding a ballroom to the White House: It would end the long-standing practice of erecting temporary structures that Trump calls tents on the South Lawn to host visiting dignitaries for state dinners and other functions. 

Cook said no other president had taken steps to correct that “until President Trump.” 

The project will be the subject of additional discussion by the National Capital Planning Commission in March. 

At the fine art's commission's January meeting, some commissioners questioned the lead architect about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed Trump's vision for a ballroom roughly twice the size of the White House itself. 




Some changes suggested at that meeting were made and were welcomed by the commissioners on Thursday. 

Trump's decision in October to demolish the East Wing prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical even for relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction of the ballroom. A court decision in the case is pending.

The project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by one of Trump's top White House aides. The commission has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.

This story has been corrected to reflect that the ballroom was approved by six of the seven commissioners and that one commission did not vote because he was the initial architect on the project.

LONDON (AP) — U.K. police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. 

The police force did not name Mountbatten-Windsor, as is normal under U.K. law. But when asked if he had been arrested, the force pointed to a statement saying that they had arrested a man in his 60s. Mountbatten-Windsor is 66. The former British prince was stripped of his royal titles because of his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

Here's the statement by the Thames Valley Police:

___

As part of the investigation, we have today (19/2) arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. 

The man remains in police custody at this time. 

We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court. 

Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. 

“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. 

“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” 




___

And here is the statement from King Charles III:

“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office. What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.

“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.

“As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.

Charles R.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump can't seem to stop talking about Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.

He refused to invite him to a White House dinner later this week with state leaders from both parties, saying he was “not worthy” of the event. And he has castigated Moore for a sewage spill that has spoiled the Potomac River, even though the faulty pipe is part of a federally regulated utility.

There could soon be more reasons for Trump to complain about Moore, the nation's only Black governor currently in office. Moore is trying to redraw Maryland's congressional map to boost Democrats, part of a nationwide redistricting battle that Trump started to help Republicans in the midterm elections.

If Moore can overcome resistance from a key member of his own party in the state legislature, the tide could continue to shift in Democrats' favor.

Moore, who is frequently floated as a potential Democratic presidential candidate, is the vice chair of the National Governors Association, which is meeting in Washington this week for its annual conference. He sat down with The Associated Press on Wednesday at the start of his visit. Here is a transcript of the interview, edited for length and clarity.

Q: You met with Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries to talk about redistricting. Can you tell me what your understanding was leaving that meeting and whether there will be an up and down vote in the Maryland legislature?

A: All we're asking for is a vote. And however the vote goes, however the vote goes. But that's democracy. 

Q: What do you see as your role in the party? 

A: I don't look at it as I'm doing it because I'm trying to help a party per se. I'm doing it because I think we have an unchecked executive and right now Congress does not seem interested in actually doing its job and establishing real checks and balances.




And I'm watching what Donald Trump is doing. This would not be an issue had it not been for Donald Trump saying, you know what, let me come up with every creative way I can think of to make this pain permanent. And one of the ways he did was he said, let's just start calling states — the states I choose — to say let's have a redistricting conversation mid-decade. 

This would not even be an issue had Donald Trump not brought this up and introduced this into the ecosystem.

Q: Speaking of the president, do you have thoughts on why he's been stepping up his criticism of you on everything from not inviting you to the dinner to his criticism of the Potomac River sewage spill? 

A: This one would actually be comical if it weren't so serious. This is a Washington, D.C., pipe that exists on federal land. How this has anything to do with Maryland, I have no idea. I think he just woke up and just said, I hate Maryland so I'm just going to introduce them into a conversation. This literally has nothing to do with us, with the exception of the fact that when we first heard about what happened, that I ordered our team to assist Washington, D.C.

The short answer is I don't know. I cannot get into the president's psyche. 

Q: Do you think it's personal? 

A: I know it's not for me. I have no desire to have beef with the president of the United States. I didn't run for governor like, man, I can't wait so me and the president can go toe to toe. I have no desire on that. But the fact that he is waking up in the middle of the night and tweeting about me, I just, I pray for him and I just feel bad for him because that has just got to be a really, really hard existence. 

Q: The White House is holding an event right now commemorating Black History Month. Could you share your thoughts on the president's relationship with the Black community?

A: Listen, I think the president has long had a very complicated history with the Black community. We're talking about a person who has been sued from his earliest days from his treatment of Black tenants. We're talking about a person who is one of the originators of birtherism. We're talking about a person who has now spent his time trying to ban books about Black history, a person who has spent his time now doing the greatest assault on unemployment of Black women in our nation's history. You know, so, I'm not sure what anyone is going to gain from an event by Donald Trump about Black history.

Q: Do you think the next presidential nominee on both sides might come from this group of governors? 

A: I see the governors as in many ways the final line of defense because I think it's never mattered more who your governor is. 

Q: The country is so polarized. How do we break the fever? 

A: You stay consistent with who you are. I think if you're a polarizing person or polarizing personality, then that's just who you are. That's just never been me.

Hawaii lawmakers are weighing tougher ways to deal with feral chickens. (AP Video by Jennifer Kelleher and Audrey McAvoy)

HONOLULU (AP) — The crowing starts well before the sun rises over Mason Aiona's home in Hawaii. 

But the 3 a.m. rooster alarm isn't what bothers the retiree the most. It's spending most of the day shooing away wild chickens that dig holes in his yard, listening to constant squawking and feather-flapping, and scolding people who feed the feral birds at a park steps from his house.

“It's a big problem,” he said of the roosters, hens and chicks waddling around on the narrow road between his Honolulu house and the city park. “And they're multiplying.”

Communities across the state have been dealing with pervasive fowl for years. Honolulu has spent thousands of dollars trapping them, to little avail. Now state lawmakers are considering possible solutions — including measures that would let residents kill feral chickens, deem them a “controllable pest” on public land in Honolulu, and fine people for feeding them or releasing them in parks.

But one person's nuisance is another's cultural symbol, a dynamic that has also played out in Miami and some other cities with populations of wild chickens. 

Kealoha Pisciotta, a Hawaiian cultural practitioner and animal advocate, disagrees with killing feral chickens simply because they're a nuisance. Some chickens today descended from those brought to the islands by early Polynesian voyagers, she said. 

“The moa is very significant,” she said, using the Hawaiian word for chicken. “They were on our voyaging, came with us.”

The Hawaiian Humane Society opposes letting residents kill the chickens “as a means of population control unless all other strategies have been exhausted.”

Rep. Scot Matayoshi, a Democrat representing the Honolulu suburb of Kaneohe, said he started crafting chicken control legislation after he heard from an elementary school teacher in his district that the birds were harassing the pupils. 

“The children were afraid of them, and they would kind of more aggressively go after the children for food,” Matayoshi said.

Rep. Jackson Sayama said he introduced the chicken-killing bill because there are currently limited ways to get rid of them. The lethal method would be at the resident's discretion. 

“If you want to go old-school, just break the chicken's neck, that's perfectly fine,” said the Democrat who represents part of Honolulu. “There's many different ways you can do it.” 




Chicken eradication bills have failed over the years, Matayoshi said. Chicken birth control was an idea discussed when he was on a neighborhood board. 

“I think there are people who are taking it more seriously now,” he said. 

For more than 30 years, Aiona, 74, has lived in a valley near downtown Honolulu in a house his wife Leona grew up in. Wild chickens didn't show up in their neighborhood until about a decade ago, they said. The birds proliferated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He once saw a man take a chicken out of his car, leave it in the park and drive away, he said.

When the chickens first appeared outside his home, he caught one with his bare hands and put it in a plastic trash can, then drove it to a park near the airport. “I took off the cover, tipped it over and the chicken ran right out,” he said. “I said ... ‘Don't come back again.'”

But he quickly realized the time-consuming effort was futile.

He's personally not interested in killing chickens, preferring for someone to scoop them up and take them to a rural farm. A city trapping program is too expensive, he said.

The city contracts with a pest-control company that traps chickens. A weeklong service costs a private property owner $375, plus a $50 cage rental fee and disposal fee of $10 per chicken. 

More than 1,300 chickens were caught through the program last year, said Honolulu Department of Customer Services spokesperson Harold Nedd, who added the department also saw a 51% increase in complaints about feral chickens in 2025.

Wild chickens aren't likely to make a cheap dinner. The meat is tougher than poultry raised for harvesting, and the feral birds can be a vector of disease.

One of Aiona's neighbors shoos them with a leaf blower. “I have a blower, too, but mine is electric,” Aiona said. “It can only go so far with the cord.”

Aiona has grown tired of spending his retirement telling park-goers to stop feeding the chickens. And while he doesn't recommend that anyone eat them, he welcomes anyone who wants one to come get it.

“No charge,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In another era, the scene would have been unremarkable. But in President Donald Trump's Washington, it's become increasingly rare.

Sitting side by side on stage were Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat. They traded jokes and compliments instead of insults and accusations, a brief interlude of cordiality in a cacophony of conflict. 

Stitt and Moore are the leaders of the National Governors Association, one of a vanishing few bipartisan institutions left in American politics. But it may be hard for the organization, which is holding its annual conference this week, to maintain its reputation as a refuge from polarization. 

Trump has broken with custom by declining to invite all governors to the traditional White House meeting and dinner. He has called Stitt, the NGA's chair, a “RINO,” short for Republican in name only, and continued to feud with Moore, the group's vice chair, by blaming him for a sewage spill involving a federally regulated pipeline.

The break with tradition reflects Trump's broader approach to his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some states, withholding federal funds or deploying troops over the objections of local officials. 

With the Republican-controlled Congress unwilling to limit Trump's ambitions, several governors have increasingly cast themselves as a counterweight to the White House. 




“Presidents aren't supposed to do this stuff,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said about the expansion of executive power in recent administrations. “Congress needs to get their act together. And stop performing for TikTok and actually start doing stuff. That's the flaw we're dealing with right now.”

Cox, a Republican, said “it is up to the states to hold the line.”

Moore echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Associated Press.

“People are paying attention to how governors are moving, because I think governors have a unique way to move in this moment that other people just don't,” he said.

Still, governors struck an optimistic tone in panels and interviews Wednesday. Stitt said the conference is “bigger than one dinner at the White House.” Moore predicted “this is going to be a very productive three days for the governors.”

“Here's a Republican and Democrat governor from different states that literally agree on probably 80% of the things. And the things we disagree on we can have honest conversations on,” Stitt said while sitting beside Moore. 

Tensions over the guest list for White House events underscored the uncertainty surrounding the week. During the back-and-forth, Trump feuded with Stitt and said Moore and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis were not invited because they “are not worthy of being there.”

Whether the bipartisan tone struck Wednesday evening can endure through the week — and beyond — remains an open question.

“We can have disagreements. In business, I always want people around me arguing with me and pushing me because that's where the best ideas come from,” said Stitt. “We need to all have these exchange of ideas.”

CNN host Audie Cornish and New York Magazine's Will Leitch suggested during a recent podcast that the U.S. could become the ""global villain"" of the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Czechia Olympic men's hockey coach Radim Rulik condemned referees for their officiating of Wednesday's Olympic men's quarterfinals between his team and Canada.

Rulik spoke out after his team's 4-3 overtime loss, saying the refs were ""afraid to call"" any penalties against Canada. 

""I feel like everyone is afraid to call anything against Canada,"" Rulik told reporters, according to a translation of his postgame interview.

""The referees really worry me. What they're allowing against us is unacceptable,"" Rulik added. ""After every game, we send them two or three clips where they confirm that the opponent should have been penalized. I don't understand it. I just don't get it.""

During the third period when Czechia's Martin Nečas was about to go on a breakaway, Canada's Devon Toews appeared to hook him in the neutral zone, but no penalty was called. 

""I watch two NHL games on replay every single day,"" Rulik continued. ""The play Necas made today — when his stick was touched on the breakaway — is always a penalty in the NHL. But suddenly, not here. I'm really sorry about it. The guys deserved a top-level performance from the referees. 

""They always admit afterward that we were right, but nothing ever changes. We should have had power plays against Canada. But they were afraid [David Pastrnak] or Necas would score another power-play goal. And if [Radko] Gudas was penalized, then Doughty should have been too for the hit on Pasta.""

Rulik previously criticized referees for their officiating of his team's win over Denmark earlier this week.

""We were basically playing against six players,"" he said. ""I don't want to make excuses, and no one has to agree with me, but the video backs me up. In this respect, it's not a fair tournament. It was happening to us even against Denmark. The mix of NHL and European referees hasn't worked — everyone calls the game differently.""

Canada was embroiled in an Olympic scandal in the Milan Cortina Olympics when its men's and women's curling teams were accused of cheating in events last week.

When Canada beat Sweden 8-6 on Feb. 13, Canadian third Marc Kennedy and Sweden's Oskar Eriksson got into it after Eriksson accused Kennedy of an illegal procedure called double-touching stones after releasing them at the hog line.

Kennedy shouted, ""I haven't done it once. You can f--- off,"" at Eriksson.

Kennedy and a team executive later leveled allegations against the Swedes of improperly filming his delivery. 

""This was planned, right from the word go yesterday. From the words that were being said by their coaches and the way they were running to the officials, it was kind of evident that something was going on, and they were trying to catch us in an act,"" Kennedy said.

Curling Canada CEO Nolan Thiessen told reporters he thinks video was shot outside of the strict rules for Olympic filming.

""I was surprised that there was a live video on the hog line outside of OBS rules,"" Thiessen said. ""That seems odd to me.""

Meanwhile on the women's side, Canadian curler Rachel Homan had her stone removed after an official ruled that she had touched it again after releasing the handle. Homan protested, but, according to World Curling's rules, there are no official replays, and the official's final call stands.

Drew Brees joins Colin Cowherd to discuss being voted into the Hall of Fame first ballot, Caleb Williams' future as the Chicago Bears' QB, and how much credit Sam Darnold deserves for the Seahawks winning Super Bowl LX. 

Caleb Williams' signature look continues to stand out. 

The Chicago Bears quarterback has embraced bold nail polish in recent years.

Williams, the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, fired back at critics of his manicure choice. He also explained the origin of the nail polish and said it raises awareness for causes close to his heart.

While Williams remembered first painting his fingernails during a visit to the nail salon with his now ex-girlfriend, he also pointed to his mother's career as a nail technician.

""One day I was with one of my exes and we were going to the nail salon,"" he said during a recent appearance on ""The Rush Podcast,"" hosted by NFL defensive end Maxx Crosby.

Williams brushed off the criticism. ""I know who I am,"" he said, noting the manicure has a dual purpose, including trolling opponents.

""And so I did it and it ended up becoming three nails, four nails, five, six... and at a certain point, I was actually doing it because you can't write stuff on your tape. You can't do all that stuff,"" he said. ""So I was doing 'F--- Texas,' with the horns down symbol... I was, like, trolling.""

""I enjoy trolling. I do,"" he said with a laugh, though he said he has to ""be careful with it now.""

While the 24-year-old does not have a problem confronting critics, he prefers to respond in a ""smart"" way.

""Somebody needs to check 'em, some of these guys. You know, all the analysts and stuff. I'll check 'em. I have no issue.""

Pushing aside the trolling aspect, Williams now picks designs that support meaningful causes.

""I've done mental health number on them and suicide prevention number on it,"" he rattled off of the nail art he's chosen in the past. ""I've done breast cancer awareness, it's just like wearing pink cleats and a pink headband.""

""It's just gel on my nails,"" he continued. ""People feel a certain way about it in a masculine sport. I give no f---s to be honest with you, I could care less.""

The NFL imposes uniform restrictions on game day. Williams stays within the guidelines while continuing to wear nail polish in support of his causes. 

""I'm going to keep doing it. It's unique to me,"" he said.

The Horizon League suspended Green Bay Phoenix men's basketball head coach Doug Gottlieb on Wednesday for one game after his epic tirade against officiating following a loss.

Gottlieb criticized officials over what he believed was inconsistency in calls during the team's 75-72 loss to the Milwaukee Panthers on Sunday. He will miss Friday's game against Oakland.

""Gottlieb's postgame comments do not reflect the League's values or sportsmanship expectations. The Horizon League considers this matter closed and will have no further comment,"" the league said in a statement.

Gottlieb apologized for his outburst.

""I'd like to apologize to the Horizon League and the officials for my disparaging comments following Sunday's game,"" he said in a statement. ""I understand and appreciate how difficult their job is, and respect what they do for the sport of basketball. I will be better moving forward.""

Green Bay was down 73-72 late in the game when Milwaukee's Stevie Elam stole the ball from Phoenix player Preston Ruedinger, who was driving to the basket. Elam was fouled and made two free throws to extend the lead with one second left in the game.

On the Panthers' previous possession, Amar Augillard drove to the basket and got a foul call. He hit two free throws to put the Panthers ahead. Gottlieb believed there should have been a foul call.

""It's the exact same play as the other end — could not be more similar,"" he said. ""And yet, every time they drove, it was a foul. And every time we did, it was mixed.""

The Panthers were 30-of-37 on free throws and Green Bay was 14-of-18.

Gottlieb was also upset with a technical foul call he was given. He slammed his hands on the press conference table as he argued he wasn't being ""demonstrative"" toward officials.

""I need the (Horizon) league to explain to me why I got a technical foul when I did not curse, I was not demonstrative, I did not leave my box,"" he said. ""All I said was, ‘That's the same play as the other end.' All we ask is that there's a fair game.

""That's what we ask. C.J. O'Hara goes and gets an offensive rebound, their player dives at his legs, C.J. gets called for a foul. I need (Horizon League Coordinator of Men's Basketball Officials Donnie Eppley) and the new commissioner (Jill Bodensteiner) to explain to me the disparity in the officiating. That's what I need explained to me.""

Green Bay athletic director Josh Moon said their department talked to Gottlieb about his actions.

""We appreciate his apology and respect the commissioner's decision, however, we do not believe his actions warrant a suspension. We feel a reprimand or public censure would have been appropriate,"" he said.

Fox News Digital spoke to shoppers outside of The Polymarket in the West Village, which was billed as New York City's ""first free grocery store.""

On Sunday in a busy stretch of restaurants and boutiques in the West Village, hundreds of New Yorkers queued up outside a pop-up shop offering free groceries. 

""New Yorkers are in pain,"" said Nick from Queens, New York, one of several people Fox News Digital interviewed outside the pop-up, as he waited to grab pasta sauce, bath soap and a bag of Tide Pods. 

The scene was underscored by the city's cost of living woes and anxiety over who would get a yellow ticket granting entry to the small shop before it ""sold out"" of goods. 

CITY-RUN GROCERY STORES, DEFUNDING POLICE, SAFE INJECTION SITES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT NYC'S NEXT POTENTIAL MAYOR

The pop-up was opened Feb. 12 as a five-day store by cryptocurrency-based prediction market Polymarket. It comes as Democratic New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani advances a proposal for city-run grocery stores aimed at easing rising food costs and broader affordability pressures. 

It was billed as New York City's first free grocery store, with critics casting it as a stunt riffing on Mamdani's proposal as the prediction-market company faces heightened scrutiny from regulators in various states, including New York.

Shoppers characterized The Polymarket — which was separate from Mamdani-led efforts to unveil city-owned, subsidized grocery stores in each of the five New York City boroughs — as a learning moment for the mayor as residents cited concerns with security, running out of food and people cutting lines. 

The giveaway drew residents from across the five boroughs — some arriving before sunrise, others showing up mid-morning in the hopes of getting a yellow ticket and a spot in the line wrapped around the block.

As the crowd grew, however, so did the tension. 

People in line told Fox News Digital Sunday that they were worried they'd made the trip for nothing.

""I literally got here at 9:00 … and basically what they said is that they ran out of tickets,"" a woman named Fatima told Fox News Digital. 

Another man, Sherrod from Jamaica, Queens, said the same happened to him. 

""They told me that they ran out of tickets,"" he said. ""I couldn't get no more food.… I couldn't get access to the store.""

Fatima and Sherrod spoke after security guards began pushing people off the block shortly after 9 a.m., when the first batch of tickets was gone. Several shoppers said they were told to leave the area and come back around 1:30 p.m. for another chance — and not to linger on the sidewalk as ticket-holders moved through the store.

""Let's go people, let's go. Go home,"" one security guard positioned outside The Polymarket was heard shouting to the crowd just after 9 a.m. Sunday. ""Do not linger, do not look, do not watch. Please go home.""

Shoppers were told the pop-up would open at noon and close at 3 p.m., or until supplies ran out. Ticket-holders were let inside a couple at a time and paired with a staffer to fill a blue tote bag at no cost.

Polymarket funded and operated the pop-up, a company representative told Fox News Digital, and the prediction market also donated $1 million to Food Bank for New York City as part of the effort.

The representative said Polymarket also gave $50 gift cards to some shoppers who ended up in the back of the line and were turned away, in an effort to ""be as accommodating as possible.""

Some shoppers slammed the setup — and the mad dash for tickets — while early arrivals said security kept the line safe.

""Security's been phenomenal,"" said Nick, who was fourth in line and received a ticket without problems. ""This morning, there was a drunk guy over here harassing a lady. And I was telling him to go. And the head security guy, he saw that we were in trouble, and he did his job and got him out of here. Protecting us.""

Another local, Michael, told Fox News Digital: ""I've seen a mix of things, like security needs to work on their presentation, dealing with the customers who are of florid backgrounds… because they don't have the customer service expertise."" 

Michael set up a chair outside the grocery store, and watched shoppers file in and out of the shop all morning, but was not positioned in line. He told Fox News Digital that he only had three cups of soup left in his cupboard but was doubtful there would be enough groceries left at The Polymarket at the end of the day for him to stock up his pantry.

The line drew all walks of life — people on disability, working New Yorkers looking for a financial boost, residents shopping for the homeless, New Yorkers living in shelters and others who did not speak English. 

Brooklynite Sumayah said she visited the pop-up earlier in the week and managed to grab ""two dozen eggs and some butter"" before items started running out. Out of work for more than two months and currently on disability, she said a free grocery trip could spare her from spending roughly $600 a month on food and household essentials.

Sumayah said the process inside could feel uncomfortable to some, as shoppers are paired with someone who moves them through the aisles. 

""Someone shops with me and I'm kind of uncomfortable with that,"" she said. ""I also understand because sometimes you might have some people that want to overdo it and grab like 10 of something… but the person that I was with, they kind of rushed me through things and I couldn't get all the stuff that I wanted.""

ECONOMIST TORCHES MAMDANI'S CITY-RUN GROCERY PLAN AS DOOMED EXPERIMENT THAT WILL COST TAXPAYERS

Even so, Sumayah said her overall experience was ""pretty calm and quiet,"" and called the pop-up ""very much needed in New York."" She said the turnout alone showed how wide the need spreads — and how quickly word of free groceries travels.

""I even met a woman that came from India yesterday and she was like, ‘Oh my God, I'm in line. I'm coming to get free food,'"" Sumayah said. ""I'm thinking like, how should I get back on the plane with that?""

Sumayah called on local leaders contemplating installing city-run stores to ensure such shoppers are safe as they wait in line for the goods — including from neighbors unhappy with the lines — while Sherrod called for a potential city-run effort to be better ""organized"" and ""learn from this."" 

Nick added that such stores should be directly located in impoverished areas and food deserts far from the wealthy streets of Manhattan. 

Almost everyone in line — no matter if they got a ticket or not — sounded off that food costs in the city were sky-high, and they needed an assist. 

""Shoot, I used to spend on average $300 to $500 on groceries,"" said Jaquan, who caught the A train to get to the market Sunday morning. ""I used to live with my mom, so that made it even worse. Right now I'm homeless, I live in a drop-in center."" 

Mary, a New York City resident, speaks to Fox News Digital outside The Polymarket. (Fox News Digital )

Another Big Apple resident, Monique, said she spent $200 on groceries ""the other day"" and ""didn't even get much."" Sherrod, who said he has a family of four, put his monthly grocery spending at around $400 to $500 and described the free groceries as a real help.

MAMDANI APPEALS TO NON-DEMOCRATS WITH GENERAL ELECTION PUSH, VOWS GOVERNMENT CAN MEET VOTERS' 'MATERIAL NEEDS'

Nick said choosing to wait for hours to get a ticket was worth it, noting it would save him as other expenses build up. 

""I've switched to fast food, and it's taking a hit on my health,"" he said, adding he was already a month behind on his phone bill because grocery costs came first.

For the more than 300 individuals who did get tickets and moved through the door, they were thrilled with the haul.

""I got the spaghetti. I got orange juice. I like orange juice,"" Nick from Queens said after making it through the store. ""I also got some ground beef. They had grass-fed ground beef, they had lean ground beef and the regular ground beef, so I'm glad I got that. I'm really glad I got the grass-fed.""

American speedskater Brittany Bowe will not leave the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics with a medal, but she will return home with a new ring. 

Team USA women's hockey captain Hilary Knight proposed to Bowe at the 2026 Winter Games. The two first met while competing at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Knight proposed on the eve of the women's hockey gold medal clash between the U.S. and Canada.

Knight shared the moment on social media, captioning a video of the two athletes in matching Team USA gear, ""Olympics brought us together. This one made us forever.""

Bowe said she has come to know a different side of Knight beyond her superstar persona.

""Knowing her as a hockey player, it's like this big, strong, powerful female,"" Bowe said. ""But then, when we got to know each other, she was soft, genuine, kind, almost shy. That really sparked my interest.""

Vani Hari, better known as the ""Food Babe,"" tells Fox News Digital that she believes more restaurants will be moving away from seed oils in the future.

Thomas Keller, famed chef and owner of the upscale restaurant The French Laundry, has some questions about an affordable housing project for the area.

The town of Yountville, California, is planning to build up to 150 multifamily workforce housing units, with additional retail and food commercial space, according to the project's notice of determination.

Chef Keller, in a statement to Fox News Digital, said he does support workforce housing — but added that ""housing only works if it actually works for the people who live and work here.""

FAST-FOOD CHAIN TO BAN ALL MICROWAVES FROM RESTAURANTS TO 'IMPROVE FOOD QUALITY'

""Before Yountville commits to a project of this size and cost, it's reasonable — and responsible — to slow down and make sure the fundamentals are right,"" Keller added. 

""Taking a pause is not opposition. It's responsible planning given all the unanswered questions — and the best way to give this project a real chance to succeed.""

Brad Raulston, town manager, told the Press Democrat the municipality does not want to slow down the housing project — and that many workers commute to the wealthy community.

""The reality is that local jurisdictions, if we don't plan and lose housing — we will eventually lose local control, and we're seeing this now throughout the state,"" Raulston told the outlet.

The project would involve the demolition of a former school administration building, which was purchased by the town for $11 million in 2024.

Funds for the purchase came from a 2018 ballot measure that added a 1% increase to the town's hotel and lodging tax, while using the revenue to fund affordable and workforce housing programs and services.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Hitler's Greenland Obsession","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/hitler-greenland/685984/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

After creating an economic mess with ill-advised tariffs, Hitler looked north in pursuit of resources and national security.

Greenland appears to have been a lifelong preoccupation of Adolf Hitler's. According to stenographic notes from a lunchtime conversation dated May 21, 1942, Hitler recalled that hardly anyone “interested him more in his youth” than Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer who in 1888 led the first team to cross Greenland's interior. A surviving volume from Hitler's private book collection contains firsthand accounts of the geologic and Arctic explorer Alfred Wegener's Grönland Expedition, which left Wegener dead in 1930 and inspired the 1933 adventure film S.O.S. Eisberg, starring the actor and eventual filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl.

Hitler's personal copy of History of the Expedition, the narrative of the tragic Wegener venture, can be perused in the rare-book collection at the Library of Congress among the 1,200 or so remnant volumes from Hitler's private library. The 198-page monograph bears his personal bookplate—ex libris, eagle, swastika—like many of the others, but is notable because unlike most, it does not include a handwritten inscription by an author, a close associate, or a distant admirer. This suggests that the volume was a personal acquisition rather than a gift, a fact made all the more interesting by the 1933 publication date, the first year of the Hitler chancellorship, when the Nazi leader's interest in Greenland transitioned from personal to strategic.

From the May 2003 issue: Hitler's forgotten library

By April 1934, Hitler's government had inventoried Greenland: 13,500 Eskimo, 3,500 Danes, and 8,000 sheep, as well as the world's largest deposit of a strategic natural resource—cryolite, a mineral essential to American aluminum production. In 1938, Hermann Göring dispatched an expedition to Greenland, ostensibly to explore the island's flora and fauna. However, Hitler's true intent may have been not scientific, but economic—the expedition was headed by a mining engineer, Kurt Herdemerten, who had been a member of the ill-fated Wegener expedition. Hitler had inflicted countless economic wounds on his country over his five years as chancellor, and this foray into the Arctic was part of a broader effort to remedy one of them.

﻿In a drive to move Germany toward economic self-sufficiency, Hitler had imposed draconian tariffs, refused to honor foreign-debt obligations, and sought to wean the nation off Norwegian whale-oil consumption. The problem was that Germany used whale oil not only for margarine, a staple of the German diet, but also in the production of nitroglycerin, a key component for the munitions industry. Whale-oil imports ranged from 165,000 to 220,000 tons annually, representing the country's single largest foreign-currency expenditure. To replace Norwegian whale oil, it was proposed that “German ships with German fishermen using German equipment” could harvest “the riches of the sea”—or Fischreichtum—“without giving a single penny to foreign countries.” So Hitler mobilized a German whaling fleet that gradually depleted whale populations in the North. By 1938, the Germans also had 31 whale-oil-processing ships in the frozen South, off the coast of Antarctica, along with two processing stations on land supplied by 257 “catcher boats.” Plans were made to declare the “whaling enterprises” German colonial possessions.

Read: Hitler's terrible tariffs

In mid-January 1939, two twin-engine Dornier “flying boats”—model Do 18-D—coursed along the coast of Antarctica, dropping weighted steel rods stamped with swastikas and bearing Nazi flags every 15 miles or so. The secret expedition, overseen by Göring and led by Alfred Ritscher, one of Germany's top Arctic explorers, was intended to stake a territorial claim “corresponding to the expansion of the economic interests of greater Germany,” as Ritscher later put it.

The Antarctic demarcation project undertaken by Ritscher in January 1939 was part of Hitler's aggressive peacetime land grab in the name of ethnic unification and national security, beginning with the annexation of Austria in March 1938 and continuing with the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in September of that year.

Hitler dismissed those who opposed the acquisition of land on the grounds of human rights as “scribblers.” No divine authority dictated how much land a people possessed or occupied, Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: “National borders are made by men, and they are changed by men.” A country's claim to territory was based on its ability to impose brute force over another, a principle that dated back, Hitler continued, to days of the “might of a victorious sword,” when Germanic tribes asserted themselves with blood and iron. “Und nur in dieser Kraft allein liegt dann das Recht,” Hitler wrote, a maxim that, distilled into English, translates as “Might makes right.”

Following the invasion of Poland, in 1939, Hitler's interests in the Far North expanded from economic to military. On April 8, 1940, Hitler briefed his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, on an imminent military operation in Denmark and Norway. The preemptive strike, Hitler explained, was a defensive measure against an anticipated attack by Britain and France that he believed might come via Scandinavia. (Sweden had already declared its neutrality.) “Approximately 250,000 men will carry out the operation,” Goebbels wrote in his diary. “Most of the artillery and ammunition have already been transported across, hidden in coal steamers.” The next morning, six infantry divisions, two motorized brigades, a paratrooper unit, and hundreds of aircraft, including 186 Heinkel bombers, launched Operation Weser Maneuver. Denmark capitulated. Norway resisted and was crushed. “Once we have the two countries,” Goebbels recorded, “England will be flattened” because Germany could use Scandinavia as “a base of attack.” As for the United States? That country “is of no interest to us,” Goebbels wrote, because by the time the Americans could deliver any material assistance (eight months, in Goebbels's reckoning) or put boots on the ground in Europe (18 months), the war would be over.

But unbeknownst to Goebbels, U.S. Coast Guard cruisers were already on their way to Greenland. A strategic analysis had determined that a well-directed shot from a German U-boat or an act of sabotage could cripple the cryolite-mining operations at Ivittuut, in the Arsuk Fjord in South Greenland, which America was determined to safeguard to protect its aluminum production.

Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish ambassador in Washington, D.C., distanced himself from the government in German-occupied Copenhagen and declared himself the representative of “the interests of the free Denmark,” a status the United States readily recognized. The American Greenland Commission was formed, and an American consulate was opened in Godthaab, the island's capital city (today known as Nuuk), with the consent of Eske Brun, Greenland's colonial administrator, who was an ally of Kauffmann's. “Adaptability of areas for installation of airfields was the first consideration governing location of forces,” Kaufmann later recalled. “Since these areas were of the same value to Germany as to the United States, these, in addition to the cryolite mine, were the localities actively defended.”

“The Eskimos in Greenland will be astonished to see how the Americans are staffing their newly established consulate,” the German newspaper Schwäbischer Merkur reported on June 9, 1940, questioning the purpose of the “ten officers and 167 men” that the Americans had dispatched to “peaceful” Greenland. “Under international law,” the newspaper observed, “Greenland belongs to Denmark.”

Another Nazi-aligned newspaper, Stuttgarter NS-Kurier, reminded its readers of Greenland's status under international law, noting that the American presence was causing “serious disquiet” in Denmark: “It goes without saying that there cannot be any talk of a change in the Danish position toward an apparent American interference in the administration of Greenland, Denmark's last colonial holding.”

On April 9, 1941, exactly one year after the German occupation of Denmark, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Kauffmann, with the assent of the Greenland colonial administrator, signed the Agreement Between the United States of America and Denmark Respecting the Defense of Greenland. The preamble of the agreement highlighted the imminent danger that Greenland “may be converted into a point of aggression against nations of the American continent.” The subsequent articles allowed the United States to “improve and deepen” harbors and to “construct, maintain and operate such landing fields, seaplane facilities and radio and meteorological installations as necessary” for the protection of the North American continent against foreign aggression.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt publicly hailed the agreement the next day. In America, Ambassador Kauffmann, as the defender of “free Denmark,” was proclaimed “king of Greenland”; in Nazi-occupied Copenhagen, he was charged with treason.

On April 27, Danish Foreign Minister Erik Scavenius, claiming to act on instructions from the Danish king, issued a formal note to Hull protesting Kauffmann's actions. By signing the bilateral agreement, Scavenius wrote, Kauffmann had acted “against the will and knowledge of His Majesty,” as well as against the “Cabinet and the Danish Rigsdag,” the equivalent of the U.S. Congress. “From real as well as from formal points of view,” Scavenius wrote, “the Danish Government has therefore been obliged to consider the agreement as invalid in point of Danish constitutional as well as international law.” For the United States to have entered into an agreement with “a person who has no country and no head of state behind him” was, Scavenius wrote, “a fiction.”

If so, this fiction was similar to the one the British government had endorsed a year earlier, after Germany had invaded France and installed the collaborationist Vichy regime. In June 1940, a 49-year-old colonel who had led the French army's 4th Armored Division in counterattacks against the Germans at Abbeville retreated to London after France surrendered. The British recognized the colonel, Charles de Gaulle, as the self-declared representative of the “free French”; the Vichy government denounced de Gaulle as a traitor and deserter, stripping him of his military rank, convicting him of treason, and sentencing him to death in absentia.

The Americans, like the British, recognized the distinction between a fascist takeover by force and the prerogatives of a democratically elected government. So just as de Gaulle was recognized as the legitimate representative of France, Kauffman was recognized as the legitimate representative of Denmark and Greenland. Over the next four years, Greenland became a vital transit point for the Allies—it had as many as 17 military facilities, including airfields and naval installations that protected the cryolite-mining operation at Ivittuut—and assisted in the liberation of hundreds of millions of Europeans across the continent. When the war was over and the democratically elected government in Denmark was restored, it willingly reaffirmed this American protection in the 1951 Defense of Greenland agreement, which remains in effect today.

A new book buries the Obama-era idea that small shifts in personal behavior can greatly improve the world.

The life of a globe-trotting environmentalist is a breeding ground for moral quandaries. My oldest friend happens to be one such climate advocate; for several years, he ran a nonprofit encouraging carbon capture in the European Union. When it comes time to attend a lecture or a summit abroad, he avoids flying if he can. If not, he flies economy—the least carbon-intensive option—and swats aside a vague feeling that he is “getting away with something.” Even though his work could help save the planet, he is forever calculating each mote of carbon that enters the atmosphere as a result of his personal choices: what to eat, where to travel, what to keep or throw away. He feels, in a word, responsible.

This is no accident. For decades, industries hoping to avoid regulation have reminded us about our personal culpability for social problems. Think of the famous 1971 “Crying Indian” ad, in which a Native American man sheds a tear over a piece of litter—a PSA that was sponsored by packaging companies. Or the concept of a personal carbon footprint, which was popularized in the early 2000s by one of the world's largest oil companies, BP. A few years after that, behavioral economists began repurposing these tactics for benevolent purposes, using subtle psychological cues called “nudges” to encourage people to file their taxes, save for retirement, exercise, and vote. Over the next decade and a half, political leaders enthusiastically embraced the idea, adopting behavioral-science solutions to far-reaching public-policy problems.

Let's say you'd like to encourage everyone to recycle as diligently as my friend does. Instead of instituting an onerous, possibly unpopular mandate, you could nudge. You could, as officials did in the United Kingdom, put up posters of watching eyes to promote good behavior. Or you could copy the authorities in Copenhagen and paint the sidewalk with footprints leading to trash bins. The problem that emerged with this approach, which is neatly summarized by George Loewenstein and Nick Chater in their new book, It's on You, is that, in retrospect, a focus on personal responsibility in this situation was “misplaced.” “The prevalence of plastics, and plastic waste, has not been caused by individual careless consumers,” they write. “It has been caused by the relentless growth of the plastics industry.”

When nudges like these work, the benefits are minor. Meanwhile, and much worse, they shift focus away from truly effective changes—in this case, a limit on the production of single-use plastics—by convincing individuals that they are at fault. In the long term, this failure to address deep social problems contributes to the erosion of people's trust in governments and institutions, breeding nihilism and an attraction to demagogues who claim to have easy answers.

Read: How useful is recycling, really?

Loewenstein is widely credited with co-founding the field of behavioral economics, and both he and Chater, a U.K.-based behavioral scientist and consultant, contributed to nudge-policy making and research. This book is in part their mea culpa. It's also a convincing argument that grounding the collective good in personal choices can be corrosive, especially in a deeply individualistic culture. Like my friend the environmentalist, many of us are left to wonder: How can we function in a society that betrays our natural concern for the world around us?

Like most would-be revolutions, the nudge was launched with a manifesto. “Better governance often requires less in the way of government coercion and more in the way of freedom to choose,” the law professor Cass R. Sunstein and the economist Richard H. Thaler wrote in their 2008 best seller, Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. The book sold more than 2 million copies and became a sensation in policy circles. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron created dedicated teams often referred to as “nudge units” within their administrations. Sunstein joined the federal government as Obama's regulatory czar. The appeal to politicians was obvious: They could engineer a better society without having to build consensus for more taxes, regulations, bans, and mandates. Sunstein and Thaler called this approach “libertarian paternalism,” which promised to resolve a central conflict in civics by, in effect, sidestepping it.

Loewenstein and Chater met on the U.K.'s nudge unit in 2013. “It is hard now to recapture the sense of possibility that was in the air as the new behavioral approach to solving society's, and the world's, problems began to gain ground,” they write. In the years that followed, their enthusiasm faded to skepticism as some of the most touted nudges proved less effective, or less durable, than advertised.

One such nudge is to “default” people into responsible choices, which exploits their natural bias for the status quo. A 2024 paper co-authored by the economist David Laibson tracked several American companies that auto-enrolled employees into sensible retirement plans with a standard minimum contribution. This worked—for a time. Because sticking with the plan was optional, many workers withdrew their money early, which mostly erased any long-term gains. Laibson and his collaborators found that workers saved less than 1 percent more of their income. By contrast, Australia signs up all earners for a retirement plan at a 12 percent contribution and doesn't let them withdraw funds before age 55. The country's retirement savings are more than 150 percent of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world.

Examples of inadequate nudges abound. In the fight against obesity, a well-known intervention is to pay people for losing weight. This does show meaningful effects—as long as they're being paid. When payment stops, they gain the weight back. As the authors note, a more lasting solution would be to place limits on fat and sugar in ultra-processed food, which makes up more than half of the average person's calorie consumption.

Chater and Loewenstein refer to these competing policy approaches—the individual and the systemic—as the “i-frame” and the “s-frame.” When we focus on i-frame nudges, they argue, we drain momentum from more effective s-frame solutions. Take paying taxes, a monumentally complex and frustrating endeavor for the average person: The IRS could just calculate your return and send you a check or a bill, as other countries' tax authorities do. But the tax lobby has consistently blocked this, promoting individual choice to protect the billions of dollars that it earns each year in tax-preparation fees. This kind of misdirection creates a “crowding out” effect: Experiments by Loewenstein and his colleagues have shown that, after people are nudged to conserve energy, they become less likely to support a more systemic solution such as a carbon tax.

Read: Our nudge in chief

Using human flaws to manipulate people into doing the wrong thing seems much easier than getting them to do the right one, especially when the negative forces are global corporations funding multibillion-dollar marketing campaigns, and the positive forces are enlightened bureaucrats sending small experimental signals. Chater and Loewenstein believe that the government nudgers are not malevolent, but misguided. But by participating in the past half century's slide into hyper-individualism, libertarian paternalists are contributing to a collective ungluing. To understand the consequences of this “one weird trick” model of ordering a society, just look at the current state of America's institutions, which are being torn down by a public convinced that nothing works.

The authors of It's on You mention the present-day social and political consequences of nudge policies, including the hunger for reform that populists such as Donald Trump have seized on and sometimes betrayed—but they don't really spell them out. The book ends with a series of prescriptions for “unrigging” the rules of democracy and the economy, many of which sound familiar: take money out of politics, close the revolving door between government and industry, hold Big Tech accountable for online abuses. Thaler, the Nudge co-author, objected in a 2023 paper that such “nanny state” initiatives are unrealistic. But if the spotty record of nudges has proved anything, it's that half measures won't solve our deepest problems. “The history of democratic politics across the world is, after all, one of continual and often convulsive struggle to wrest control of the political and legal processes from the few to the many,” Chater and Loewenstein write.

But what if the problem is not only structural but also cultural? I suspect that the authors would largely agree that nudges didn't make American society pathologically individualistic and atomized; instead, nudging was a well-meaning but inadequate attempt to circumvent a mindset that is already baked in. The depth of this predicament was apparent during the coronavirus pandemic, when social media abounded with declarations of resistance such as that of the retired baseball player Aubrey Huff, who stated that he “would rather die” than wear a mask. You might say that the United States has—as the behavioral economists might put it—its own cognitive bias. You could call it the cowboy effect.

At times, that bias has dragged us down; in other moments, it has helped us achieve a collective good. Large social changes built around appeals to personal freedom, such as the legalization of gay marriage, seemed impossible until a substantial proportion of the public showed visible support for them, and then they started happening all at once. Today's progressive populists, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have gained some limited traction in portraying the government as a protector of individual freedom against corporate power, much as President Franklin D. Roosevelt sold his New Deal policies as a shield against the “economic tyranny” of that era's oligarchs.

Which brings me back to my friend the environmentalist. He knows all about the manipulative history of the nudge, including the packaging-company PSA and the carbon footprint, yet he still feels a personal obligation that goes beyond his work in the s-frame. With a lot of thought, he has learned to recontextualize the sense of responsibility. Now when he carefully chooses to stay home rather than fly, or when he eats veggies instead of pork, he imagines not a one-man fix to the climate crisis but a quiet demonstration of a new social norm, which one day might force politicians to act—if not through the recycling bin, then through the ballot box. After all, there is a way to harness the collective effort of individuals to bring about desperately needed change. It's called a government.

A questionable lawsuit seeking to redraw a Republican district risks turbocharging Trump's gerrymandering campaign.

Every now and then, a judge hands down a decision that is so ill-advised that it is impossible to read without burying your face in your palm. New York State Judge Jeffrey Pearlman's opinion in Williams v. Board of Elections of the State of New York is such a case.

Pearlman's opinion is so out of step with the current US Supreme Court's approach to racial gerrymandering cases — the Court's Republican majority opposes nearly all laws that are race-conscious in any way — that it is hard to imagine it surviving on appeal.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

But the case also gives the Supreme Court's Republican majority a vehicle that they could potentially use to accelerate one of their major policy initiatives — eliminating the federal Voting Rights Act's safeguards against gerrymandering, and permitting Southern red states to draw GOP-friendly maps that are currently still illegal.

For four decades, the Supreme Court has read the Voting Rights Act to sometimes require states where racial minority groups have little representation in Congress or the state legislature to draw new legislative maps that will elect more candidates of color.

The rules governing when states must redraw their maps, which were first laid out in the Supreme Court's decision in Thornburg v. Gingles (1986), are sufficiently complicated that they cannot be summarized concisely. But, as a general rule, Gingles kicks in when a state is residentially segregated by race, and when voters in that state are racially polarized — typically meaning that white voters strongly prefer candidates from one party, while nonwhite voters prefer candidates from the other party.

In those circumstances, Gingles can require a state to draw additional districts where a racial minority group is in the majority, to ensure that group has adequate representation.

The practical effect of Gingles is that red states with a white majority sometimes have to draw additional Black or Latino districts that elect Democrats. Unsurprisingly, Gingles is not beloved by the Supreme Court's Republican majority. The Court is widely expected to toss out Gingles in a case known as Louisiana v. Callais, which the justices heard last October.

Yet, because the Court typically does not release its most contentious decisions until late June, Callais will most likely not come down until well after the 2026 midterm election cycle has already begun. So red states that want to draw new, more Republican maps — but that have been prevented from doing so by Gingles — may not be able to draw those maps until the 2028 election cycle.

However, the Williams case presents a very similar legal question to Callais. And, unlike Callais, Williams reached the Supreme Court on its “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices often decide on a very tight timeframe.

By ordering a Republican congressional district redrawn, in other words, Pearlman gave the Supreme Court's Republican majority a case they can potentially use to get rid of Gingles several months ahead of schedule — potentially giving several red states the time they need to redraw their maps before the 2026 midterms get fully underway.

In her brief to the justices, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), whose district is at the center of Williams, also urges the Supreme Court to embrace a dubious legal theory that would give the Republican justices sweeping authority over federal election-related legal disputes that arise under state law. Currently, questions of state law are decided by state courts, not the US Supreme Court.

Malliotakis's district includes Staten Island and some parts of southern Brooklyn. The district leans significantly to the right — Malliotakis won her 2024 race with 64 percent of the vote — but Democrats can win it in an unusually strong election year. Former Rep. Max Rose (D-NY) won the district in 2018, but lost his reelection bid in 2020 to Malliotakis.

Pearlman's opinion concludes that this district must be redrawn by the state's redistricting commission because, as it is currently configured, the district violates a provision of the New York Constitution that closely tracks the federal Voting Rights Act.

But Pearlman interpreted this provision of the state constitution more aggressively than the Supreme Court had interpreted the Voting Rights Act, even back when the Court had a pro-Gingles majority. In Bartlett v. Strickland (2009), the Supreme Court held that Gingles does not require states to draw new “crossover districts,” where minority voters are able to combine their votes with similarly minded white voters to elect their candidate of choice.

Nevertheless, Pearlman held that New York's constitution goes further than the Voting Rights Act, and that Malliotakis's district must be redrawn as a crossover district. The practical effect of this decision would be to convert this fairly red district into one that leans toward Democrats, because voters of color in New York tend to prefer Democratic candidates to Republicans.

But even if Pearlman is correct that New York law requires crossover districts, even when federal law does not, his decision has little chance of surviving contact with the Supreme Court. The Court's Republican majority is broadly skeptical of any legal theory that requires legislative districts to be redrawn in order to change their racial makeup — that's why they are expected to toss out Gingles in the Callais case. The premise of Pearlman's decision is that New York law requires state courts to redraw at least some legislative districts for racial reasons, even when federal law does not require that outcome. It is difficult to imagine a legal argument better calibrated to provoke the Supreme Court's Republican majority.

There is a chance that New York's own courts will make the Williams case go away before the Supreme Court decides it. Malliotakis has also asked a state appeals court to intervene, and if that court blocks Pearlman's order, there will be no need for the federal justices to get involved.

But if the state courts do not act quickly — Malliotakis asked the Supreme Court to weigh in by February 23 to prevent Pearlman's order from disrupting the upcoming primary and general elections — then it is very likely that this Supreme Court will reject Pearlman's approach. In the worst-case scenario for Democrats, that Supreme Court decision could also repudiate Gingles, which would free up many red states to draw gerrymandered maps for the 2026 election that are illegal under current law.

A New York judge's decision that would increase Democratic representation in Congress, in other words, could have the ironic effect of increasing Republican representation in the US House.

Malliotakis's brief to the justices also proposes a different way to resolve Williams that would significantly expand the Republican Party's control over federal elections. The Supreme Court has rejected this theory, which is known as the “Independent State Legislature” theory, many times over more than a century.

It most recently did so in Moore v. Harper (2023), after retired military leaders warned the justices not to embrace the Independent State Legislature theory because it “undermines election integrity and exacerbates both domestic and foreign threats to national security.”

Yet, while Moore largely put the Independent State Legislature theory to bed, the Moore opinion also included an ominous line suggesting that the Supreme Court could assert greater authority over federal elections at some future date. That line claims that “state courts may not so exceed the bounds of ordinary judicial review as to unconstitutionally intrude upon the role specifically reserved to state legislatures.” Malliotakis claims that Pearlman's decision misinterpreted New York's constitution so badly that the Supreme Court should invoke Moore and reject Pearlman's reading of New York law.

If the Court did that, it would be a constitutional earthquake. Normally, each state's highest court has the final word on questions of state law. Overruling a state court on such a question would eliminate that check on federal power and transform the justices into the final arbiter of virtually any dispute involving federal elections.

The Supreme Court's Republican majority — the same Republicans who ruled that President Donald Trump enjoys broad immunity from criminal prosecution — could potentially override state election procedures or even second-guess the outcomes of federal elections decided under state law.

Democrats should hope that New York's appellate courts make Williams disappear. By handing down a questionable decision benefiting Democrats, Pearlman gave a Republican Supreme Court a powerful weapon it could use to elect more Republicans.

How did Costa Rica beat back deforestation and buck the global trend?

For several decades now, the story of the world's rainforests has been the same tragic one: These iconic, animal-filled ecosystems are getting cut down to make way for farms and ranches, roads and mines. And it doesn't appear to be changing. In 2024, the most recent year of global forest data, the tropics lost a record 16.6 million acres of primary fores , largely to fires and agriculture. More than half of that recent loss was in Brazil and Bolivia.

But one country has a very different narrative: Costa Rica.

In the late 20th century, Costa Rica — a Central American nation a little smaller than West Virginia — had one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. The country was losing more than 100,000 acres a year. And by 1985, forests covered less than 25 percent of its area, down from closer to three-quarters just a few decades earlier.

But then, near the start of the millennium, the trend abruptly flipped. Deforestation plummeted, and trees started growing back. Now, natural forests blanket well over half of Costa Rica, making it one of the few places on Earth that has revived its lost ecosystems.

How did Costa Rica do it?

One reason that gets a lot of attention is that Costa Rica put a price tag on nature — on the natural “services” that forests provide, from sucking up planet-warming carbon dioxide to sustaining the local water supply. Nearly three decades ago, the country began paying private landowners for those services, if they conserve or restore forests on their property. That created a concrete, financial incentive to keep forests standing. Costa Rica was the first country in the world to implement a national “payment for ecosystem services” scheme.

In the decades since, as Costa Rica's forests came back, other countries followed in its footsteps, like Mexico and Vietnam, developing programs of their own that subsidized forest conservation. Together they fueled the idea, still popular in the conservation community, that you can save nature by valuing it in economic terms — terms that everyone, including capitalists, can understand.

But there's still an open question: Do these payment programs actually work?

There has now been more than 20 years of research from Costa Rica on the program's impact on forests. And a new study, published this month, looks more specifically at how the payment system affects biodiversity — the collecting of animals that live within them. These studies complicate the story of how Costa Rica became lush again.

Part of what made Costa Rica's ecosystem payment program so groundbreaking is that it recognized — at the highest level of government — that living forests are not only a source of timber, but are economically valuable for lots of other reasons: they reduce greenhouse gases, produce clean water, draw tourists, and are home to plants and animals that scientists use for biology research and drug development.

In simple terms, the government pays landowners who enroll in the program for every hectare (roughly 2.5 acres) of forest that they protect or replenish by planting new trees. They receive more or less money, depending on how they manage their land. By planting native trees in a degraded landscape, for example, landowners can earn more than $170 per hectare per year, on average, for the duration of the contract (16 years for planting native trees). If a property owner protects existing natural forest on their land, meanwhile, they earn between roughly $44 and $110 per hectare per year. If they let forests regrow naturally on pastureland, they earn less.

At first, the government funded the program through a tax on fuel, such as gasoline. Now it also raises funds to pay landowners from other sources, such as a fee on water usage. The idea is that people who use services that forests provide should help pay for them. Forests help maintain rainfall by pumping water into the air through transpiration. They also help prevent pollution and sediment from entering the water supply.

The program provides what is essentially a subsidy for the lost opportunity that could come from farming or ranching on the land, said Giacomo Delgado, a doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland, who is studying the impacts of the program. “If that payment wasn't there, you can imagine that a lot of people would continually clear the forest,” he told Vox.

To date, the government has more than 20,000 contracts for payments with landowners, a spokesperson told Vox, and the program currently covers 540,000 hectares of forest — an area a little smaller than the state of Delaware.

For years now scientists have debated about whether or not these sorts of payment schemes actually work. Yet despite more than two decades of research, the answer is still elusive.

I reviewed more than a dozen studies from Costa Rica, and on the whole, they suggest that the program has had a modest positive impact on forests overall — but not a big one. A comprehensive 2008 study by the World Bank, in the northeastern region of Sarapiquí, determined that the program led to “a small but statistically significant increase in the area of forest conserved.” Other studies that analyzed the early years of the program indicate that it didn't reduce deforestation or only worked in some regions.

A more current analysis, led by the Inter-American Development Bank, detected a drop in deforestation on land that was part of the program. Yet the results were only significant (statistically speaking) for the first year after enrollment. There also wasn't much deforestation to begin with. A 2024 paper, meanwhile, found that forest cover increased on farmland after it was enrolled in the program, but the study couldn't definitively attribute those increases to the payment system.

Then there's this new study — an analysis, led by Delgado of ETH Zurich, that looks beyond forests to the wildlife within them. The research compares the biodiversity present on land inside and outside the payment program to healthy baseline forests in northwest Costa Rica. And it does so using sound. A healthy tropical forest produces a distinct, complex noise, comprising the calls of frogs, birds, and insects. Damaged ecosystems sound quieter and simpler.

Delgado and his collaborators put microphones in different landscapes and analyzed the sounds they picked up. As they discovered, land in the payment program — on which forests were naturally regenerating on old farmland — were far more similar to healthy, old forests than to pastures that were not enrolled in the program. You can actually listen to some of the recordings here. “It's a strong signal that [the payment program] is working for biodiversity,” said Laura Villalobos, a Costa Rican economist at Salisbury University, who was not involved in the study.

The major drawback of many studies on Costa Rica's pioneering payment program — including this new one — is that they don't show that the forests or biodiversity have recovered because of the program. “What's really challenging is the issue of causality,” said Hilary Brumberg, a doctoral researcher at Stanford University, who was not involved in the acoustics study. “There are just so many confounding factors,” said Brumberg, who studies Costa Rica's forests.

There are many other reasons why forests in Costa Rica may have grown back. In 1996, for example, the government effectively banned deforestation in the country, making it illegal to convert natural forests to other kinds of land (though some logging is still permitted). Around the same time, the price of beef collapsed. That made clearing land for cattle less profitable and caused some landowners to abandon their pastures. Meanwhile, the country's ecotourism industry ballooned, providing incentives to keep the country's iconic forest ecosystems intact.

Importantly, Costa Rica also has a more pervasive environmental ethic compared to other forested nations. In fact, research suggests that some people join the payment program not for the money but because they want to contribute to forest conservation as a public good.

Obviously, something is working. Costa Rica is green again. But the payment program has likely played only a small part in the country's success.

That's consistent with research beyond Costa Rica, which finds that compensating landowners for ecosystem services has a positive but small impact. Ultimately, these sorts of programs haven't been the solution to deforestation that environmental advocates were hoping for, said David Simpson, a now-retired environmental economist. “Trying to make nature valuable, it turns out, has had a disappointing track record,” Simpson wrote in 2018.

In response to a request for comment, Karla Alfaro Rojas, director of the Department of Institutional Communications for the Costa Rican government, said, in an email: “Costa Rica doesn't have to prove anything to anyone. We are an international leader in financial mechanisms and forest cover restoration.”

In a world with so many environmental problems, perhaps it seems unproductive to critique a program that is, if anything, helping conserve tropical forests. But there is an important lesson here: No one solution, no one model, will solve a problem as difficult as deforestation. Costa Rica was successful because it had all of the right pieces in place — strong policies, favorable economics, growing non-extractive industries, and, perhaps most importantly, political will.

Cautious consumerism isn't a bad thing, but there's a lot we don't know about these products.

Nothing has made me appreciate the sheer scale and power of targeted advertising like having children. Months before the births of both my kids, it felt like every ad I encountered wanted to sell me baby products. And on seemingly every product were the same two words in bold letters: plant-based.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

I'm not kidding. Diapers, baby wipes, teething rings, bath toys — it's all plant-based these days. Once I saw the phrase on baby products, I started to notice it everywhere. There are plant-based foods, of course (like Impossible burgers and Beyond sausage). There's plant-based protein, which is kind of like the plant-based meat only less meaty and now showing up in weird places like breakfast cereal. And once you leave the grocery store, you can find plant-based cosmetics, cleaning products, toothbrushes, sneakers, phone cases, and yoga mats. Don't forget the plant-based packaging to wrap it all up.

It wasn't immediately clear to me what plants did to deserve the spotlight here. I knew that plant-based foods tend to be better for people and for the environment. But was the same true for plant-based plastics, fabrics, and chemicals?

Still, as a dad trying to keep my kids from harm, I hoped for the best. I bought the plant-based diapers, wipes, and toys. On their labels, alongside the term “plant-based” were words like “eco” and “food-grade,” which signaled two big things to me as a consumer: safe and sustainable. The vast majority of plastics, for instance, are made from fossil fuels, which are damaging to everyone, and microplastics, the tiny synthetic particles left over as plastic breaks down, are showing up in our water supply and our bodies.

On the other hand, I've seen how brands prey on consumers' anxieties and use greenwashing to make them seem healthier and more sustainable. Is the boom in plant-based products more of the same? I decided to find out.

You can trace the term plant-based back to the early 1980s, when a nutritional biochemist named Thomas Colin Campbell was presenting a paper to the National Institutes of Health research grant committee. It was about the role of nutrition in cancer and the benefits of consuming more vegetables, fruit, and grains, rather than meat, but Campbell thought calling the diet vegetarian would be polarizing to the committee. “My solution was to choose ‘plant-based' for lack of a better word,” Campbell later wrote. He later expanded the description of the diet to “whole food, plant-based.”

The term slowly entered the mainstream in the decades that followed, but Campbell has said it really took off after the success of his 2005 book The China Study. The book is based on a study of the lifestyles of 6,500 Chinese people and linked plant-based diets to lower rates of cancer. It was only a couple years later that Michael Pollan coined his now famous mantra, “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants,” in a New York Times Magazine story that he later adapted into the bestseller The Omnivore's Dilemma. This is also broadly when we saw the rise of flexitarianism, the diet that's mostly plants but allows for a little meat or fish.

Plant-based products invaded the grocery store in the 2010s. While labeling something as “vegetarian” or “vegan” might turn some consumers away, the plant-based moniker offered the perfect mix of natural and approachable. After all, who doesn't like plants? Following a significant rise in the number of new food and drink products labeled as plant-based between 2012 and 2018, the number of plant-based packaged goods increased by 302 percent from 2018 to 2022.

The jump from food to all kinds of consumer products happened for several converging reasons around this time.There was the federal government's push for more biobased products through the expanded Farm Bill of 2018, as well as the bioplastic industry's newfound ability to scale up its production. More brands bet on plant-based branding (LEGO released its first plant-based pieces, which were made of sugarcane-based polyethylene, that same year). In 2020, Pampers brought the trend to the mainstream baby market with its Pure diapers, which had plant-based liners.

All of these plant-based products are supposedly engineered to be better in some way. Plant-based cosmetics that are supposed to be better for your skin (although not as good as human-based cosmetics apparently). Plant-based cleaners are supposed to be better for the air quality in your home. Plant-based packaging is supposed to be better for the planet.

The problem is that “plant-based” doesn't have an agreed-upon definition (nor does “better”), and the label isn't regulated in any way. When you see something bearing the “certified organic” or “Fair Trade Certified” seal, you know that it's met a strict set of requirements established by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Fair Trade USA, respectively. But there's nothing stopping a company from slapping “plant-based” on its packaging, just like there are no regulations limiting the use of the terms “natural” or “green.” In 2025, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) released draft guidance on “plant-based” labeling, but those recommendations are nonbinding.

“I wonder if ‘plant-based' is a new ‘natural,' because saying something is natural has obviously been played out,” Josée Johnston, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto, told Vox. “Nobody takes that seriously anymore.”

Plant-based items aren't necessarily appealing to consumers just because we think they're good. They also represent the absence of bad. The label makes you believe that because an item isn't made of conventional plastic, it must be free of the microplastics that might invade your bloodstream and settle into your brain. Surely it won't take centuries to decompose in a landfill.

But just as products billed as “natural” aren't necessarily free of artificial ingredients, products marketed as plant-based are full of things that aren't plants — some of which are quite dangerous. They can include things like PFAS, which are known as forever chemicals because they break down slowly and accumulate in the body, which are linked to serious health problems, like cancer and weakened immune systems among children. Chemicals in plant-based products can also emit volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which are a form of air pollution that can cause respiratory problems in the short term and, in the long term, also cancer.

Plastic that's plant-based rather than petroleum-based sounds like it would be biodegradable, too. But the most popular bioplastic, known as polylactic acid, or PLA, actually requires specific industrial composting conditions to break down efficiently. In other words, you can't just dump bioplastics into your backyard compost bin and expect them to fertilize your garden. If you put a PLA-based plastic bottle in your garden, it actually could take centuries to decompose.

Shifting to these plant-based materials can have positive effects. In general, using bioproducts over fossil fuel-based products can help lower emissions and reduce landfill waste, when managed properly. But they also come with climate consequences of their own. For example, growing plants requires less land than livestock, but it still takes up a lot of land. Meanwhile, if bioplastics aren't composted in a particular way, they act like petroleum-based plastic in landfills and the environment. They don't break down, but they do produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.

None of this necessarily means you should avoid plant-based products. It just takes some extra work to know what's in them — and what to do with them when you're done.

It's hard navigating the world while watching it burn. Many people, rightly, want to do their part to make things better, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless. When companies offer us products that make us feel better about all kinds of things — our carbon footprint, our health, our safety — they are really selling us a sense of agency. You buy organic produce, because you're worried about how the conventional stuff was produced. You buy bioplastics, because you think they're less likely to break down into microplastics. You buy plant-based diapers, because you think the regular ones will harm your baby. Norah MacKendrick, a sociologist at Rutgers, calls this cautious consumerism and says that it's not a bad thing.

“Americans know, on some level, that the ingredients in the products on their store shelves, from baby food to diapers, haven't been carefully vetted for their impacts on health — not by any governmental body or by the companies themselves,” she told Vox.

“People do have a sense that the way we're consuming is not sustainable,” said Johnston, the University of Toronto professor. “They're more aware of plastics in the environment, plastics in water, and so I think they're going to be drawn to products that offer them a way out, a way to manage that dissonance and discomfort in everyday life.”

It's frustrating, then, that the plant-based moniker is functionally useless. The onus is on shoppers, often women, to do the research and figure out which products live up to their implied promise of being healthy or environmentally friendly or simply not as harmful as the conventional thing.

Plant-based products are no panacea. They're also not necessarily bad products. In terms of measurable impact, however, there's still a lot we don't know.

There is a mountain of evidence that plant-based foods are better for the environment. Transitioning everyone from meat-based to plant-based diets, for instance, could reduce diet-related land use by 76 percent and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50 percent. Meanwhile, consuming a whole foods, plant-based diet can reduce the risk of heart disease by 25 percent, according to one meta-analysis. Michael Pollan's mantra holds up.

Things get a bit trickier when it comes to other plant-based products, and even more difficult when it comes to items for babies. When you're looking at the environmental impact, there's good evidence that plant-based plastics, which are often made of corn or sugarcane, tend to have a smaller carbon footprint and to be more biodegradable. But that corn or sugarcane has to be grown somewhere, which means using resources like land and water. Plus, as mentioned above, PLAs require industrial processes for proper composting. If you just bury a “compostable” plant-based plastic fork in your backyard, there's a chance it will decompose about as slowly as petroleum-based plastic. Plant-based plastics may also include additives, including bisphenol A or (BPA) or phthalates, which can disrupt your endocrine system.

Similar patterns pop up when you're talking about plant-based textiles, beauty products, and cleaners. They're probably better than their conventional counterparts, but there are caveats. Some “vegan leather,” for instance, might get billed as plant-based but is actually just regular, petroleum-based plastic. (The New York Times called this rebranding “a marketing masterstroke meant to suggest environmental virtue.”) A lot of plant-based fabric is actually man-made cellulosic fibers (MMCFs), like viscose, rayon, or lyocell, which are energy intensive to produce.

All of these products come with their own set of health concerns. Plant-based textiles can be treated with PFAS for waterproofing (vegan leather is a particularly bad offender). Plant-based cosmetics and cleaners can be made with fragrances and chemicals that emit VOCs. And even though something is plant-based, it could still contain allergens or irritants. We also still don't fully understand what microplastics are doing to our bodies, but plant-based plastics can get micro-sized, too. Research shows that bioplastics degrade and produce micro- and nanoscale pollution, just like conventional plastics, and they present new problems because we know even less about what they do to humans and to the environment. (If you're still confused about recycling plastic, which is warranted because it's confusing, check out this guide.)

You might read all of this and assume everything is awful and dangerous, which is fair. But I look at it as evidence that all products are more complicated than a single ingredient, whether that's petroleum or corn. It can be intimidating to wade through the alphabet soup of chemicals and certifications to know what's safe, according to Sheela Sathyanarayana, a pediatrician who runs a lab at Seattle Children's Hospital studying how chemicals affect children.

“This is very hard at the individual consumer level,“ said Sathyanarayana, who points to the Environmental Working Group as a good resource. “But overall there is not one space that talks both about ecological sustainability and chemical human safety together (that I know of).”

If you're cautious about how that product may affect the planet, you, or your baby, take a closer look. Seek out companies that not only say they use good ingredients, but also say they avoid harmful ingredients. Here's a list of brands that claim they avoid PFAS, for example. You can also look for independent certifications, like OEKO-TEX Standard for textiles, as well as government programs, like Safer Choice from the Environmental Protection Agency or BioPreferred from the USDA for authoritative information. Again, the term plant-based is not regulated, so it alone is not a good guide.

I'll confess, I bought some plant-based diapers from a brand called Dyper. They were billed as non-toxic, chlorine free, charcoal-enhanced, stuffed with wood pulp from responsibly managed forests, and theoretically compostable. The problem was that they were stiff as a board, and they leaked. They also cost more than double what I'd been buying for my kid — roughly a dollar a diaper versus less than 50 cents. If I wanted to compost the dirty diapers, I'd have to bag them up and call for a truck to come pick them up and take them to a special industrial composting facility.

It just shows how much work it takes to be a cautious consumer. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. If you see something's plant-based, that might catch your attention, but dig into the details to figure out just how good that product is for the environment or for you. If you're shopping for a baby, you'll want to be extra careful to look out for certain chemicals, especially phthalates, PFAS, and VOCs. But admittedly, this is especially challenging when it comes to diapers; companies don't have to list the ingredients in their diapers (except in New York, where it recently became required by law).

In your quest for safe and sustainable products, there is ultimately the option of just buying less stuff or buying secondhand. That's not an option with disposable diapers, of course, but it's a great course of action when it comes to clothes, furniture, and home goods.

When all else fails, try buying something that's completely, verifiably natural. Lately, I've been seeing a lot more natural rubber baby products. There are teethers, bath toys, and pacifiers. Natural rubber is just tree sap, so it seems safe enough. Natural rubber can also grow mold, however. If only anything could be simple.

To some extent, Americans are talking about alcohol more than ever. We're having open conversations about the negative health impacts of drinking. People are consuming less booze overall and examining strategies to moderate, even as each drink packs more punch. There is one aspect of alcohol we're still not talking about: addiction, and, more precisely, the medical treatments available to combat it. What's even odder — your doctor may not know much about them, either.

Even as researchers examine the potential for GLP-1s such as Ozempic and Zepbound to reduce alcohol consumption, the most underappreciated story in alcohol use disorder isn't the promise of new drugs. It's why the ones we already have are so rarely used. There are three FDA-approved medications to treat AUD in the US: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram. They've existed for decades, are effective for some people in reducing or stopping drinking, and, addiction physicians say, have few drawbacks.

Despite all of this, they are broadly unknown to patients and widely underprescribed. Just 2% of Americans with an alcohol disorder diagnosis receive approved medications for treatment, says Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. By comparison, 85% of people diagnosed with diabetes get approved treatments for it.

These drugs aren't a panacea — like all medications, some things work for some people and not others. But they're an important tool in a toolbox to treat a condition that affects millions of Americans and takes thousands of lives each year.

""The challenge here is to really treat addiction the same way we treat diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Parkinson's, depression, and the list goes on and on,"" Leggio says.

At a basic level, the medications used to treat alcohol use disorder do something quite simple: they make drinking less appealing.

The first is naltrexone, which was first developed to treat opioid use disorder. It blocks the warm, buzzy feelings of alcohol — people may still drink, but it doesn't do much for them. (They'll still get the impaired effects of alcohol, just not the euphoria.) Some people use naltrexone to undertake what's called the ""Sinclair Method,"" where they take the drug an hour before starting drinking so that when the session begins, the pleasurable effects from the alcohol are blunted. The idea is that if the person takes naltrexone every time they drink, the associated reward with alcohol will lessen, reducing cravings over time and thus leading to a significant drop in drinking or even abstinence. Some people may choose to take naltrexone only when they have what could be a potentially heavy drinking event, like a wedding, so they end the night with two drinks instead of 10. Naltrexone is also available through an extended-release one-month injection.

Another option is acamprosate, which restores brain balance after it's been thrown off by heavy alcohol use and can help reduce cravings, though it doesn't reduce alcohol's effects in the moment. It's prescribed more commonly in Europe. The final of the trio is disulfiram, which inhibits the body's ability to break down alcohol — essentially, it makes people sick if they drink. It's the least commonly prescribed of the three because of high rates of patient noncompliance.

Research shows that naltrexone can help reduce heavy drinking and cravings, and acamprosate can help promote abstinence and prevent a return to drinking.

""I really view medications as being tremendously helpful in turning the volume down on craving, on withdrawal symptoms, on some of the other reasons that people struggle,"" says Katie Witkiewitz, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico who specializes in substance use disorders.

Effectiveness can vary among patients and can be modest, as with many medications. The same goes for side effects, which can include headache or nausea (sometimes caused by naltrexone), and lack of appetite or irritability (sometimes caused by acamprosate). Addiction specialists say the medications are generally well-tolerated by most patients.

""There's lots of benefits and very few drawbacks,"" says Sarah Wakeman, the senior medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston. ""These medications are incredibly safe, and you need very little, if any, lab monitoring.""

The drugs are also hyper affordable — naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are all generics, and they're generally covered by insurance. The exception is Vivitrol, the naltrexone injection, which is still under patent.

Given how straightforward these medications are, it's natural to ask why they aren't used more often. The answer is complicated, having to do with the stigma around addiction, lack of patient knowledge, and the ways in which our society and the medical establishment treat alcohol.

Alcoholism is a disease of denial — individuals often minimize, rationalize, or lie about their drinking. Even people who drink moderately tend to fudge the numbers when asked about their alcohol habits, either by their doctor or people they know. Our culture writ large is in denial about alcoholism, too. We tend to treat it as a lack of willpower, as a moral failing, and a bad habit people need to knock off. We generally don't see it as the chronic condition it is.

Many people may not realize they are engaging in problem drinking, and if they do, they may not go to their doctors about it. Treatment for alcohol use disorder has ""largely evolved outside of the mainstream of healthcare,"" says Dr. Caleb Alexander, a practicing internist and drug safety expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Historically, it's been siloed into specialty treatment programs — behavioral therapies, rehabilitation centers, or groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery. These work for some people, but not everyone. Alexander adds that many of these settings don't have prescribers, formularies, or medication management that would provide access to AUD drugs. Some groups may also be opposed to medication intervention.

Those who do seek help through the healthcare system often run into discouraging obstacles, and doctors themselves may be ill-equipped to help. Physicians are often poorly trained in addiction medicine in medical school or residency. They may not be versed in the medications available or have a misperception that they need specialization to prescribe them. Doctors are also people, and they may hold the same biases as anyone else about alcohol.

""A lot of doctors don't even want to have these conversations at all,"" says Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University who specializes in addiction and a former senior policy advisor in the Obama administration.

The result: the medications that are at doctors' fingertips go woefully under-discussed and under-prescribed. People lie to their doctors about their drinking instead of having open, honest talks. Because these drugs are generics and don't lead to a huge payday for manufacturers, there's no marketing money behind them, and they have no champions. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: Since there is such a small market now, potential innovations for alcohol addiction are stunted.

""If doctors don't want to prescribe it and patients have never heard of it, then a company is not going to develop the next drug for drinking because they're like, 'It's a waste of money,'"" Humphreys says.

There are some online providers to fill the void, such as telehealth company Oar Health and Ria Health, which focus on medication-assisted alcohol treatment. They can be options for people who may be too embarrassed to go to their doctors or whose doctors are resistant to trying medications, but they're also costlier and may not come with the same level of supervision.

There are some signs that this neglect may not be a permanent state of affairs.

Researchers are studying whether GLP-1s such as semaglutide and tirzepatide might help reduce alcohol consumption. While some early evidence is promising, experts say it's too early to tell just how effective they might ultimately be. If GLP-1s do prove useful in helping to treat alcohol use disorder, they have some advantages other medications do not: there's a lot of money and momentum behind them.

""They're already part of the cultural milieu,"" Witkiewitz says. ""People are using them, people are wanting them, and that's not something we typically see with medications.""

GLP-1 makers were initially hesitant to investigate the effectiveness of their drugs on alcohol use because they were concerned it might damage their brands, Humphreys says, in another example of just how pervasive the addiction stigma is. Now, ""the companies have decided they're going to go for it.""

At the moment, GLP-1s are merely a hope in helping people manage problem alcohol use. The reality is that there are options out there, they're just often ignored. The overarching barrier has more to do with lack of will than lack of way. Ideally, there would be multiple other drugs under development for the treatment of AUD, and more patients and doctors would know about what's already out there.

""All these tools that we have, from 12 steps to AAs to behavior treatment to medications, they're not mutually exclusive,"" Leggio says.

The way we talk about and approach drinking can and should evolve. The FDA recently formally recognized a reduction in drinking as a valid endpoint in alcohol-related clinical trials, meaning the goal of medications under development doesn't need to be total abstinence — it can also be helping people to slow down. It's a ""paradigm shift,"" Witkiewitz says, and may lead to more drugs to help curb drinking and more doctors aware of the health benefits of cutting back.

The real test is whether we finally treat alcohol addiction like a disease rather than a character flaw. We've done it with other conditions before. While there's still a stigma around obesity, that is changing, thanks in part to GLP-1s, as more people accept the idea that weight loss is about more than willpower.

""There's this idea that medications are a crutch or making it an easy way out,"" Wakeman says.

Perhaps a better parallel is depression. For years, it, too, was swept under the rug. People were told to shake it off. Today, it's widely understood as a treatable condition. There are a variety of medications available, and many patients try different formulations and dosages until they find the right fit. For some people, medication isn't the answer, and they use other strategies to combat and mitigate it. People aren't expected to be free of depressive episodes forever, even with treatment, and in many circles, it's quite commonplace to discuss, whether at the doctor's office or over lunch.

""Prior to Prozac becoming now a completely banal thing that you can talk about at a dinner party, depression was, 'You need a kick in the butt, pick yourself up, what's the matter with you?'"" Humphreys says.

Alcohol use disorder could now be reaching a similar inflection point. The science behind treatments has existed for years, but the culture has lagged behind. GLP-1 drugs may help to accelerate a shift in how we think about medication to curb drinking. And if we're talking so much about the dangers of drinking, shouldn't we be giving people as much help as possible to slow down and stop?

Lorenzo Miro San Diego first learned about Polymarket after seeing the prediction market on an episode of ""South Park"" last fall.

His first wager: $498 on the University of Houston beating Oregon State in a college football game. He netted more than $100 after the odds shifted further in Houston's favor.

For the next two months, things didn't work out as well. He lost money, on net, on a series of bets related to professional football and basketball. He also began dabbling in cryptocurrency price movement wagers — and lost money on those, too.

In total, he lost more than $1,700.

""I wasn't able to set any virtual limits,"" San Diego told Business Insider. ""Unlike sportsbooks that I can visit when I'm in an area where they are legal, there was a lack of control and tools to be transparent for how much I could lose.""

In February, San Diego filed a lawsuit against Polymarket in hopes of recovering his losses. He said he managed to stop on his own accord, partly by switching his sports bets to an app where he doesn't use real money.

He's not the only person to have lost a significant amount of money on a prediction market. And as courts, lawmakers, and regulators debate what limits to put on sites like Polymarket and its chief competitor, Kalshi, problem gambling experts say their lack of guardrails increases the potential harm to millions of Americans.

""It's a huge distraction, and I don't think it's a healthy distraction,"" said Susan Sheridan Tucker, a former stockbroker who leads the Minnesota Alliance on Problem Gambling, of prediction markets. ""Particularly if you don't understand how these markets work, you can get yourself into a lot of trouble.""

K.A., a 24-year-old engineer from Virginia, sank more than $10,000 into Kalshi during an eight-day stretch in late December, according to screenshots he shared with Business Insider.

After initially limiting himself to small bets on Counter-Strike, a shooting game he played that's popular among e-sports fans, he began staking more than $1,000 at a time on the outcome of NBA games and tennis matches. He also took out thousands of dollars in loans, he said, so that he could wager more, chasing his losses until he cut himself off.

""There'll be a big winning streak at the beginning, which happened to me — then bam, everything's gone,"" he said.

Daniel Umfleet, the CEO of the telehealth company Kindbridge Behavioral Health, said problem-gambling treatment providers have only just begun to try to tease out their patients' use of prediction markets from financial activities like day-trading cryptocurrencies or stocks.

""We are seeing more of it, but it's not like we're seeing it coming through like it's a tidal wave, or a dam has burst,"" he said.

The National Council on Problem Gambling has estimated that about 2.5 million adults in the US could be diagnosed with severe gambling addiction, and 5 to 8 million more meet some criteria. Most never seek treatment.

Problem gambling poses a special threat to young men, many of whom initially seek help because of pressure from a spouse or parent, Umfleet said. Some compulsive gamblers have other mental health issues, like anxiety or depression, Umfleet and others said.

K.A. said he thinks more young people should know the warning signs for when their use of prediction markets becomes a problem. Placing larger and larger bets, ""chasing losses"" with the belief that they will make their money back, and selling other financial assets to take positions on prediction markets — all of which he said he did — are red flags, he said.

The amount Americans spend on ""event contracts"" on platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, Robinhood, and Crypto.com is still only a fraction of what they spend at brick-and-mortar casinos and on state-regulated gaming and sportsbooks apps. As with sportsbooks, researchers have found that most users of Kalshi and Polymarket lose money.

Kalshi has disputed a report that its median user loses 7% of their balance within 90 days of signing up. Elisabeth Diana, a Kalshi spokesperson, declined to provide alternative figures, saying they vary and are between 1% and 7%. Kalshi and Polymarket have said they're fairer than traditional gambling, with Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan calling sportsbooks a ""scam.""

According to the American Gaming Association, gambling businesses netted more than $71 billion in the first 11 months of last year.

Kalshi, the largest prediction market in the US, made $263.5 million in fees last year, according to an estimate by the news website InGame. The CEO of Robinhood, a finance app that lets users buy event contracts from Kalshi and ForecastEx, has said prediction markets could eventually generate $300 million for the company each year.

It's a fast-growing niche. Kalshi said the total volume of trades on Super Bowl-related markets on its platform was $1 billion, 27 times higher than the year before. That's more than half of the $1.76 billion that the American Gaming Association estimated would be wagered on the game through sportsbooks.

The American gambling industry has grown rapidly since 2018, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting.

The popularity of speculating on cryptocurrencies, meme stocks, and prediction markets by young people has been a particular cause for concern among policy experts and financial-wellness advocates.

Robinhood and other brokerages geared toward young people were accused of ""gamifying"" markets to drive growth during the meme-stock mania of 2020 and 2021. Critics have accused them of blurring the line between gambling and investing.

College-aged Americans in particular see gambling as something that's ""so easy,"" said Pamela Brenner-Davis, who works on gambling addiction issues in New York.

K.A. said his first introduction to Kalshi was through TikTok. He saw one ad after another — every third or fourth video in his feed, he said, was about ""how easy or accessible"" it was to use the platform.

Sportsbooks have also advertised and spent heavily on promotions in recent years, surpassing $800 million in 2021 and falling somewhat since then, according to industry-sponsored research based on Nielsen data. State regulators generally require sportsbook and casino ads to target people over 21 and mention the risks of problem gambling and resources available to help with addiction. Prediction markets aren't required to do the same.

Earlier this month, the National Council for Problem Gambling called on all prediction markets to publicize the national gambling helpline, 1-800-MY-RESET. So far, it doesn't appear that any have done so.

Kalshi has ways for users to limit their use and cut themselves off. The company also announced a partnership with a telehealth company that helps people with problem gambling and other mental-health challenges, which often co-exist.

Other event-contracts platforms do not have any such features, however.

Polymarket, whose US product is still in limited release, has no information on its website about gambling safeguards. OG, a prediction market created by Crypto.com, recently announced plans to offer ""margin trading"" on events contracts and leans heavily into sports imagery in its marketing. It doesn't have any information about problem gambling resources on its website, though it warns that the contracts it offers are risky and not appropriate for everyone.

Polymarket and OG didn't respond to requests for comment.

Some prediction markets take issue with the use of the term ""wagering"" or ""betting"" to describe what users do on their platforms. They have resisted efforts by state governments to regulate their activities and have described their products as swaps or futures, which are financial instruments subject to regulation by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The National Council for Problem Gambling told the CFTC last year that ""betting on futures is functionally gambling"" and expressed concern that anti-addiction safeguards weren't available on prediction markets.

The CFTC's new chair, Michael Selig, has said the agency will start writing rules for event contracts. The process of writing and rewriting the rules could take anywhere from months to more than a year.

Commodities regulators ""are used to regulating things like prediction market liquidity, manipulation, fair access,"" said Glenn Yamagata, an economist, consultant, and part-time executive director of the Oregon Council on Problem Gambling.

""They're not sort of used to dealing with mental-health issues or having things like voluntary self-exclusion,"" he said.

The ""South Park"" episode that introduced San Diego to Polymarket lampooned the regulatory uncertainty that exists in prediction markets. When a character tried to complain about a market, he was routed to the CFTC, then to another federal agency, and ultimately to the White House.

K.A. said he decided to stop after realizing he hit ""rock bottom"" and told his partner about the problems he was having, which he said derailed their plans to move into a nicer apartment this spring. Now he's in recovery, has uninstalled the Kalshi app, and is meeting with a therapist.

San Diego said he would tell other users: ""Bet with your head, set limits, and know when to quit.""

Problem-gambling professionals say more needs to be done to get the message out.

""Where there is gambling activity, there is a potential for gambling harm,"" said Brenner-Davis.

The old saying ""Everything is bigger in Texas"" now applies to data centers.

The Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.

The shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.

More than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.

Texas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.

That amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.

That 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.

Part of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.

The state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.

Texas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.

Northern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.

The world's biggest AI leaders gathered in New Delhi this week, prepared to talk about the latest models and their impact on societies. They seemed less prepared for a 14-person hand-hold that tech circles will remember for a long time.

On Thursday, top executives, including Demis Hassabis, Sundar Pichai, Brad Smith, Sam Altman, and Dario Amodei, lined up on stage with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the India AI Impact Summit.

In his signature style, Modi held hands with Pichai on his right and Altman on his left and began raising their linked arms for a celebratory photo. Modi has previously taken photos this way with world leaders, including former US President Joe Biden and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The other tech execs were quick to catch on to Modi's directive, looking right and left before grabbing their neighbour's hand.

The photo op's most meme-worthy scene was the OpenAI and Anthropic CEOs not managing — or refusing— to hold each other's hands. After a pause, they raised their arms without making contact.

The moment was widely screenshotted and shared on social media.

The awkward moment followed a Super Bowl advertising jab between the two AI giants earlier this month. Anthropic's 30-second commercial roasted OpenAI over its decision to bring ads to ChatGPT. 

After Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ad teasers, Altman responded with a lengthy post on X, calling the Anthropic ad ""dishonest.""

Amodei cofounded Anthropic in 2021 after leaving OpenAI, citing disagreements over AI safety priorities and the lab's leadership style.

Oil prices have climbed in recent weeks, even as a global surplus has left hundreds of millions of barrels floating offshore.

On Wednesday, oil prices ended over 4% higher as traders priced in the risk of supply disruptions amid tensions between the US and Iran and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine, after talks in Geneva ended without a breakthrough.

Oil futures edged up early Thursday, with US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures trading around $65.30 per barrel at 1:04 a.m., while international benchmark Brent crude was around $70.50 per barrel.

Prices of both grades are around 15% higher this year after three straight years of decline, reflecting a return of the geopolitical risk premium despite a global oil supply surplus.

The key reason for the disconnect is that much of the surplus has materialized as sanctioned crude ""stuck at sea,"" while inventories in key pricing hubs have remained stable, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Wednesday note.

Goldman estimates the oil market ran a surplus of about 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025. Normally, that kind of oversupply would weigh heavily on prices.

Instead, many tankers carrying sanctioned crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are sitting at sea, using ""dark fleet"" and shadow shipping tactics to evade sanctions and keep oil moving.

While that allows sanctioned oil to keep flowing, it also leaves more barrels lingering at sea, far from storage centers such as the US Gulf Coast and Northwest Europe — regions that anchor global crude pricing.

Sanctioned crude inventories on water have risen by around 130 million barrels from a year ago and now stand at roughly 375 million barrels, Goldman estimates. That accounts for about one-third of the increase in global crude inventories.

""Inventory builds matter less for prices when occurring on water,"" Goldman wrote, because traders discount barrels that may never reach key pricing hubs.

The buildup stemmed from weaker demand for sanctioned crude late last year, as India and China bought less Russian oil.

That softer demand reflected shifting geopolitical incentives, including changes in US trade policy, as well as expectations of steeper discounts or possible sanctions relief, the bank added.

But the dynamic may not last.

""We assume that the pace of stockpiling moderates at sea but picks up on land,"" Goldman wrote.

The bank expects the share of oil inventory tied up offshore to fall from about 47% in 2025 to roughly 21% in 2026.

Holding its global surplus estimate constant, Goldman's framework suggests that every 1 million barrels per day of sanctioned crude that piles up at sea for 12 months can lift Brent by as much as $8 per barrel.

Meanwhile, every 100 million barrel reduction in oil stored offshore — as cargoes move into land-based inventories — could lower prices by $3 to $4.

Goldman expects Brent to average $56 per barrel and WTI $52 in 2026, the bank's analysts wrote in a separate note on January 11.

AI demand has surged in recent weeks, according to new data that could support tech giants' decisions to dramatically ramp up investment in this area.

OpenRouter, which helps developers access different AI models, has seen activity roughly double in the first weeks of 2026.

This is measured by the number of AI tokens OpenRouter processes. AI models break down words and other inputs into numerical tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about ¾ of a word.

OpenRouter handled 13 trillion AI tokens in the week that ended February 9. That's up from 6.4 trillion during the first week of January.

Seen over a year, this recent surge is even more striking. AI models that OpenRouter taps into include Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, OpenAI's GPT range, and a host of open-source offerings from DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and others.

This data excludes AI tokens processed directly by the major AI companies, so it represents a small fraction of total activity. For instance, Google was processing 1.3 quadrillion tokens a month this past summer. However, the recent rate of change in OpenRouter's data is a valuable signal.

Anand Iyer, a partner at VC firm Lightspeed, said the recent surge has been driven by an explosion in AI agent activity and especially the rapid emergence of OpenClaw, an open-source agentic system.

That's sparked an exponential increase in inference, which is how models, agents, and other AI services are run in the cloud.

""The demand for AI inference right now is coming from agentic platforms, especially OpenClaw,"" Iyer told Business Insider this week. ""We moved from simple chatbot experiences to agentic automation and execution, which has driven exponential growth of OpenClaw installations and OpenRouter usage.""

There are other signs of rising AI use. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggests demand for Nvidia AI chips has increased lately. The chart below shows the cost to rent Nvidia H100 GPUs. As you can see, prices have rebounded strongly since early December, which implies robust AI demand.

OpenClaw launched in November 2025. That coincides with the H100 rebound here.

A third data point comes from Barclays analysts, who recently looked at online traffic to vibe coding services, including Lovable, Replit, and Wix's Base44.

The consumer website-based vibe coding services Barclays tracks saw traffic jump 17% month over month in January.

""This was the strongest growth since April 2025,"" the analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. ""The uptick in interest here was driven largely by frontier model improvements in late 2025 that made these platforms more effective.""

The debate still rages over whether AI will be used enough to justify all the heavy investments being made. Big Tech companies recently increased capital expenditure plans to eye-watering levels, raising new concerns about a potential AI bubble.

This new AI usage data may suggest that demand could be strong enough to support such heavy spending.

""AI capex today, as we know it today, is largely driven by training requirements from large frontier labs,"" Iyer said.

Training is a data- and energy-intensive process in which AI models are created in massive data centers. Inference comes after models are run.

""The sustainability is warranted as long as the revenue produced by inference (which is growing exponentially) will justify the output from the training,"" Iyer said. ""Which seems to be working so far.""

OpenClaw is part of a broader evolution of generative AI. The era kicked off with a bang when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, and the chatbot became the fastest-growing tech product in history.

More recently, AI models have begun to support autonomous digital agents and similar tools that can use computers independently to accomplish complex tasks.

OpenClaw's open-source technology supports agents that help users automate coding and other workflows by accessing computer files, email, calendars, and messaging services.

In January, Anthropic unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles tasks such as document generation and file management.

The startup rolled out Claude Sonnet 4.6, its latest AI model, this week. It's gotten better at what Anthropic calls ""computer use,"" where AI models and agents use computers in similar ways to humans to get tasks done.

""The model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard,"" Anthropic wrote in a blog on Tuesday.

This type of machine-to-machine activity is behind a lot of the surge in AI token use lately. It makes sense: most people can use a computer for seven or eight hours a day. Then, they need a break or a nap. AI models never sleep and can hack away at a task uninterrupted until it's done.

Salesforce says it's at the vanguard of the AI revolution and has even toyed with renaming itself Agentforce in honor of its bet on AI agents. The company is rapidly adopting AI internally as well, and a survey obtained by Business Insider reveals how that's actually playing out behind the scenes.

The results — which were broadly positive — show that most employees feel AI is increasing their productivity, although fewer say it's lightening their workloads.

Salesforce's annual ""Great Insights"" survey, which is not public, was conducted in November 2025 and released inside the software company the following month. It surveyed about 80% of the 76,000-person workforce.

Most questions about AI received high favorability ratings: In addition to the 81% of employees who said AI tools boost productivity, 83% said they feel equipped to handle AI risks such as bias, and 81% said they felt encouraged to experiment with AI.

More than half of employees — 57% — said AI tools helped their team identify opportunities that would have been impossible otherwise. And 62% said their workload is more manageable because they use AI tools. Both of these were among the lowest results in the survey.

Salesforce told Business Insider in a statement that the survey showed significant gains in AI use and strong enthusiasm. A composite it creates called the AI Readiness score was at 85% enterprise-wide, an 18% gain year-over-year.

""We're thrilled that our employees have moved on from adoption and are seeing AI tools make a meaningful impact in their daily work,"" a Salesforce spokesperson said.

The results suggest that Salesforce is ahead of the pack on encouraging AI adoption, said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor at Georgetown University's business school who has interviewed dozens of executives about AI adoption. The results also show that, for some employees, AI intensifies their workload rather than reducing it. 

""The gaps suggest people believe AI is enabling them to do more work, but it's not making their work easier,"" he said.

Salesforce, which sells customer relationship management software, has garnered attention for an intense AI push led by CEO Marc Benioff. Last August, he said half of the work at Salesforce was being done by AI and that the company had eliminated 4,000 support roles because of AI agents.

Salesforce's website says the company uses a mix of internal AI tools, including an AI from Salesforce-owned Slack that can quickly find old project templates, and Career Connect, which analyzes employees' strengths and weaknesses to help them move within the company.

Salesforce is facing challenges despite its embrace of the AI revolution. Its stock is down over 40% in the past year as concerns mount about the fate of legacy software companies amid the arrival of AI tools from OpenAI and Anthropic.

The company has also struggled to deliver on promises made in demos of its AI product Agentforce, Business Insider previously reported.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince, was arrested on Thursday morning, his 66th birthday.

In a statement, the UK's Thames Valley Police said it had arrested ""a man in his 60s from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office.""

""We are unable to name the arrested man as part of national guidance,"" it added.

Around two hours after news of the arrest broke, King Charles released a statement saying: ""The law must take its course.""

""I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,"" he added.

""What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation,"" he said.

The Prince and Princess of Wales are understood to be aligned with the King's statement. 

Photos showed police at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Thursday, where Mountbatten-Windsor is said to have been living. He previously lived in Windsor, Berkshire.

The police said it was carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.

Mountbatten-Windsor, the brother of King Charles, was stripped of his royal titles last year amid scrutiny of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

The family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with the former Prince three times, also issued a statement on Thursday.

""Today, our broken hearts have been lifted by the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,"" they wrote.

The latest release of the Epstein files showed more of Mountbatten-Windsor's communications with the convicted sex offender.

In 2010 and 2011, when the former prince was a UK trade envoy, he appeared to forward official reports on his work visits to Epstein.

""Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,"" said Oliver Wright, assistant chief constable with the Thames Valley Police.

""It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence,"" he added.

Before the arrest, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC, ""Nobody is above the law.""

""[The police] will conduct their own investigations, but one of the core principles in our system is that everybody is equal under the law and nobody is above the law,"" he said.

The last time a senior member of the royal family faced arrest or police action appears to be in 2002. Princess Anne — Mountbatten-Windsor's sister — pleaded guilty under the Dangerous Dogs Act when her English bull terrier bit two children while walking in Windsor Great Park.

Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.

Schott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms ""destroyed"" her mental health.

""I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,"" Schott said of Zuckerberg. ""I was not backing down.""

Schott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.

The case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.

Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.

Last month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could ""significantly impact"" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have ""sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'"" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the ""high tens of billions of dollars.""

In a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: ""We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people."" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.

Google declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: ""The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.""

On Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.

""We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,"" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes ""the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.""

""It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,"" Neville said.

On the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.

Zuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.

""If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,"" he said.

Sarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.

Gardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, ""I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.""

AI is shaking up the job market — but in some cases, companies are blaming the technology for layoffs they were already planning, says OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

""I don't know what the exact percentage is, but there's some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there's some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,"" Altman told CNBC-TV18 on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.

""I expect we'll see more of the latter over time,"" he said.

Altman added that although new types of jobs would be created in the AI era, the ""real impact of AI doing jobs"" would begin to be palpable in the next few years.

Companies that have cited AI when reducing employee head count include Amazon, IBM, Salesforce, and HP. There is no evidence of AI washing at these companies, a term used to describe companies overstating the role of artificial intelligence in a product or business decision.

Altman, whose company provides AI tools that reshape and displace jobs, has previously said the technology will cause job disruption, but that people will find new forms of work and adapt.

Others have been more explicit. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned last year that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years. Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, said last month that he was already seeing some evidence that AI was causing a hiring slowdown at the company for junior roles.

Ukrainian soldiers are out cutting and snapping any fiber-optic drone cables they come across, regardless of which side they belong to. They use scissors, knives, even their bare hands.

Troops say it doesn't matter if a drone is Ukrainian or Russian. If they're not sure, they just assume it's hostile.

These unjammable drones controlled by long, thin cables have flooded the battlefield as a countermeasure to the electronic warfare that often renders radio-frequency drones inoperable.

As these drones have become increasingly prolific, the result has been forests and trenches snarled with discarded and active cables.

Dimko Zhluktenko, an analyst with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, said that he always carries scissors so that he can ""cut each and every optic fiber that we see.""

He said that his unit ""actually stopped considering them friendly or foe. We think that all of them are kind of the enemy drones.""

In a YouTube video about the gear he carries, Zhluktenko said scissors became so essential that when his unit started operating in areas littered with fiber-optic cables, every team member was required to carry a pair. He said that he bought retractors for his team so no one would lose them.

A Ukrainian soldier who spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said troops can often break the thin strands with their hands; that isn't often necessary, though. Soldiers in his unit already carry scissors for medical purposes. Many also have knives.

He said that there can be so many cables about on the battlefield that ""you don't know if it's a new thread or if it's an old one that's been lying around for a long time."" So his unit severs any they find as often as possible.

Other similar behaviors have been observed on the battlefield.

There are sometimes so many drones in the sky that soldiers looking up from the ground can't even begin to tell which is friendly and which is hostile. In such cases, soldiers can be ordered to shoot down any drone they see.

Soldiers in charge of electronic warfare systems sometimes panic and jam everything in the air when they can't tell drones apart, Zhluktenko previously told Business Insider.

Zhluktenko told Business Insider that cutting the fiber-optic cables is not something that he had to do often, as his unit was typically working in areas further from the front-line fighting that had fewer of the fiber-optic drones. He described it as something that they ""sometimes"" encountered.

Soldiers in Ukraine's 15th Mobile Border Detachment ""Steel Border"" previously said in a video for Ukraine's state border service that using scissors is a reliable way to disable the Russian drones. Russian soldiers have reportedly done the same.

If the cable is intact on an active and operational drone, the only other way to stop it is to physically shoot it (troops say a shotgun works best); that requires a mix of skill and luck, though.

Fiber-optic drones are a relatively new feature in this war that have not previously been fielded at this scale. That these drones can be disabled with simple tools — scissors, knives, bare hands — underscores a broader pattern in Ukraine: sophisticated systems are often countered with low-tech fixes.

In many cases, some of the most effective counters to advanced technology have been older or improvised combat tools — from shotguns used against small drones to nets draped over vehicles and positions to blunt aerial attacks. Even the drones themselves are cheap innovations designed to overcome more expensive equipment and wartime demands.

In this article

West Virginia's attorney general has filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Apple, alleging that it has failed to prevent child sexual abuse materials from being stored and shared via iOS devices and iCloud services.

John ""JB"" McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing privacy branding and its own business interests over child safety, while other big tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox, have been more proactive, using systems like PhotoDNA to combat such material.

PhotoDNA, developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth College in 2009, uses ""hashing and matching"" to automatically identify and block child sexual abuse material (CSAM) images when they have already been identified as such and reported to authorities.

In 2021, Apple had tested its own CSAM-detection features that could automatically find and remove images of child exploitation, and report those that had been uploaded to iCloud in the U.S. to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.

But the company withdrew its plans for the features after privacy advocates who worried that this technology could create a back door for government surveillance, and be tweaked and exploited to censor other kinds of content on iOS devices.

The company's efforts since then have not satisfied a broad array of critics.

In 2024, UK-based watchdog the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said Apple failed to adequately monitor, tabulate and report CSAM in its products to authorities. 

And in a 2024 lawsuit filed in California's Northern District, thousands of child sexual abuse survivors sued Apple, alleging the company never should have abandoned its earlier plans for CSAM detection features, and by allowing such material to proliferate online, it had caused survivors to relive their trauma.

Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive of the Big Tech companies, since its CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014. 

If West Virginia's suit is successful, it could force the company to make design or data security changes. The state is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection.

In an e-mailed statement, a spokesperson for Apple told CNBC that ""protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do.""

The company pointed to parental controls and features like Communication Safety which, ""automatically intervenes on kids' devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop and even live FaceTime calls,"" as an indication of its commitment to provide ""safety, security, and privacy"" to users.

""We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids,"" the spokesperson added.

Bill Gates has become a source of controversy at this week's high-profile India AI Impact Summit, as speculation around his planned keynote address ultimately ended with his withdrawal at the last minute. 

The drama comes as the Microsoft co-founder receives public backlash for his past relationship with deceased financier and sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — with more details on the two men's years of communications revealed in the Department of Justice's file drop last month. 

The Gates Foundation India on Thursday said the billionaire would skip the address ""[a]fter careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities,"" adding that he would be replaced by another foundation representative. 

The official announcement capped a back-and-forth saga that began earlier this week when local Indian media pointed out that Gates' name had been removed from some of the summit's public-facing materials. 

Government sources later briefed the media that Gates was not expected to attend the event. However, the Gates Foundation issued a conflicting message on Wednesday, insisting that he was participating ""as planned"" before the recent reversal. 

Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, India's IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters that Gates' attendance would come down to ""personal choices,"" adding he ""need not comment."" The summit organizers and the foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Gates' absence.

The American tech leader turned philanthropist has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following the release of millions of documents related to financier Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. 

The files included a draft email written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other references of the Microsoft co-founder. 

In an interview with Australia's 9News last month, Gates denied any wrongdoing, commenting in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations ""absolutely absurd and completely false.""

He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he ""never went to the island"" and ""never met any women.""

The New Delhi AI Impact Summit, where Gates had been scheduled to speak, has seen participation from leading tech names such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, besides a host of global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.

The Gates Foundation has invested in India across health and development, and has also backed projects related to AI.

In this article

No United Airlines credit card? Soon you'll earn fewer miles than other travelers.

United is overhauling its MileagePlus frequent flyer program to reward travelers with more miles and lower redemption rates, including for some of its long-haul business-class seats — if they have one of the airline's credit cards. It's the latest move by an airline to reward its highest-spending customers.

The changes mark the biggest shake-up to the lucrative program in more than a decade, when United began rewarding customers for how much they spent — not just how far they flew.

United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CNBC in an interview that the airline has been working on the changes for about 18 months and that the carrier is aiming to reward its most loyal customers.

The shift also comes as United tries to stand out in an ever more competitive landscape for travel and rewards credit cards. That space also includes American Express' Platinum, Capital One's Venture X and Chase's Sapphire Reserve cards. 

""In the credit card space in general, a lot's changed over the last five to 10 years in terms of the number of travel credit cards that are out there,"" Nocella said. ""What I'm thinking about as we make these changes for United is to make sure that if you hold the credit card, you put it top of wallet, and then if you don't hold the credit card, there's a reason to get the credit card that seems incredibly compelling if you'd like to fly United Airlines and if you'd like to have that ... trip to Tahiti or to Rome or wherever we may be able to take you.""

The changes take effect April 2. United is planning to show the discounted award flights on its website ""so customers can see exactly how much having a United card could save them on their travel,"" the airline said.

United's loyalty program update is part of a trend among airlines to reward frequent flyer program members depending on how much they spend. About a decade ago, the major carriers tweaked their loyalty programs to reward customers for dollars spent over miles traveled.

Airlines also encourage customers to sign up for their credit cards by offering perks like no fees for checked bags and earlier boarding.

United MileagePlus primary cardholders will get more miles per dollar spent on United flights compared with customers without a card, and higher rates than they do currently. Their earning goes up, too, when they actually use that card to purchase the ticket.

Meanwhile, customers without the card will earn less than they do today. 

For example, a traveler without a co-branded United Airlines credit card will get three miles per dollar spent on a ticket, down from the current five miles. Under the new structure, a cardholder could earn six miles, and more if they use the card to buy it. Those with elite MileagePlus status earn miles at a higher rate, too.

United debit cardholders will also receive more miles, once they spend $10,000, United said.

United will also now allow customers with one of its credit cards to redeem their miles for flights at a discount of at least 10% compared with those without the card.

The carrier said that, as an example, an economy-class award ticket that was 15,000 miles will go for 13,500 without elite Premier status. United said it's setting aside special discounted inventory of award tickets for cardholders, including for top-tier Polaris seats.

Those with elite MileagePlus Premier status will get deeper discounts and better miles redemption. Elites with a card get at least 15% off mileage tickets. 

United said its a seat in a long-haul business class Polaris cabin that is going for 200,000 miles would be 170,000 miles if the cardmember has elite Premier status. United added the lowest priced ""Saver Award"" seats for Polaris would be accesible to MileagePlus members with a United card, seats that were previously just available to high-tier elites.

Their earning rates also increase if they have both the credit card and status. MileagePlus 1K, the highest tier before Global Services, will get 17 miles for each dollar spent when they use their United Club credit card. 

United Airlines travelers who don't have the credit card won't receive miles for basic economy tickets. American Airlines last year similarly said it would no longer allow travelers in that class to earn miles, following an earlier move by Delta Air Lines. There's an exemption, however, for holders of United's elite Premier status, who can still earn miles in basic economy.

Business travelers often have to book with company credit cards under corporate travel policies. But United said that individuals who personally hold a United credit or debit card will still get more miles than an employee who doesn't.

Happy Thursday. My spin class soundtrack of mainly Kesha's music last night was more evidence that the 2016 aesthetic is back.

Stock futures are lower this morning. The three major indexes are coming off a winning session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Shares of Walmart slid more than 2% in premarket trading this morning after the company's guidance for the current fiscal year came in softer than anticipated.

Here's what to know:

Minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting released yesterday showed officials largely approved of holding interest rates steady. However, there was notable division within the central bank on where monetary policy should go next.

As CNBC's Jeff Cox reports, some Fed members said interest rates could come down further if inflation slides as they expect it to. Others said such easing may not be necessary for some time while they await clear signs that disinflation is taking place.

Speaking of the central bank: White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett told CNBC yesterday that the authors of a recent New York Fed paper should be ""disciplined."" Hassett said the study, which found that U.S. companies and consumers are absorbing most of the impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs, was ""the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system.""

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary warned yesterday that U.S. is falling behind China on early-stage drug development, saying the U.S. should streamline the process for beginning trials on new treatments.

In an interview with CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino, Makary also said that all drugs ""should be over the counter"" — with the exception of those that are unsafe, addictive or require monitoring. Some in the pharmaceutical industry have raised doubts about the effectiveness of such a move, warning that it could increase costs and decrease access for patients.

Meanwhile, Moderna said yesterday that the FDA agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot — a reversal from the regulator's prior refusal of the application. Moderna's shares jumped around 6% in yesterday's session following the announcement.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand yesterday in a landmark trial on social media and safety. As CNBC's Jonathan Vanian and Samantha Subin note, the Los Angeles trial is just one of several major court cases that are together being described as the social media industry's ""Big Tobacco"" moment.

In his testimony, Zuckerberg said that increasing users' time spent on Instagram was never a company goal, despite an email he sent in 2015 that seemed to make improving engagement a critical issue for the company. The Facebook founder also said he approached Apple CEO Tim Cook to talk about the ""wellbeing of teens and kids.""

Members of Zuckerberg's team were seen entering the courthouse wearing Meta's Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses, but Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl later threatened to hold anyone using smart glasses during the CEO's testimony in contempt of court. ""If you have done that, you must delete that, or you will be held in contempt of the court,"" Kuhl said.

If you're flying United Airlines, you may soon earn fewer miles — unless you have one of the air carrier's credit cards. 

United said Thursday that it will no longer reward customers flying basic economy who don't have the airline's credit card, following in the footsteps of American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Card-holding travelers, meanwhile, will earn more points and receive frequent flyer discounts. 

As CNBC's Leslie Josephs reports, the airline's changes mark some of the biggest adjustments to its frequent flyer program in more than a decade.

The Supreme Court could rule as soon as this week on Trump's tariffs. But as CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Natalie Rice report, the furniture industry likely won't be sitting pretty, regardless of the court's decision.

— CNBC's Melissa Repko, Annie Palmer, Jeff Cox, Annika Kim Constantino, Samantha Subin, Jonathan Vanian, Leslie Josephs, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Natalie Rice contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has sharply criticized the Trump administration's fuel blockade on Cuba, saying Moscow considers the latest restrictions unacceptable.

His comments come as the island nation grapples with a worsening economic crisis, one that has been compared to its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

""This is a special period, with new sanctions. You know how we feel about this. We do not accept anything like this,"" Putin said on Wednesday during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, according to Russian news agency Tass. 

Russia, which has been allied to Cuba for decades, has recently described Havana's fuel situation as ""truly critical"" and said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to the country.

""We have always been on Cuba's side in its struggle for independence, for the right to follow its own path of development, and we have always supported the Cuban people,"" Putin said.

""We know how difficult these past decades have been for the Cuban people as they have fought for the right to live by their own rules and defend their national interests,"" he added.

The U.S. has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.

U.S. President Donald Trump has since pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies Havana with oil and labeled its government as ""an unusual and extraordinary threat.""

Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian ""collapse"" earlier in the month.

Cuba's government, which has condemned the U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.

It also suspended an annual cigar festival which had been due to take place in Havana later this month, without providing details of a new date. 

Photos of daily life in Cuba have shown piles of waste building on Havana's street corners in recent days as many collection trucks have been left with empty fuel tanks.

The White House has said it was in Cuba's interest to make big changes soon, although stopped short of calling for a change of government. 

""They are a regime that is falling. Their country is collapsing and that's why we believe it's in their best interest to make very dramatic changes very soon,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.

In this article

Shares in Blue Owl Capital tumbled 8.7% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held across three of its private debt funds.

Blue Owl said Wednesday it had agreed the sale with four North American pension and insurance investors, with the loans changing hands at 99.7% of par value.

The largest sale comes out of the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II fund, also known as OBDC II, a semi-liquid private credit strategy aimed at U.S. retail investors. 

OBDC II offloaded $600 million in loans, amounting to about 34% of its $1.7 billion portfolio.

In a major switch, Blue Owl said that following the deal, OBDC II would end regular quarterly liquidity payments to the fund's investors.

Instead, the business development company — which specializes in private credit lending to U.S. middle-market companies — will pivot to periodic payouts that will be funded by asset sales, earnings, repayments and other strategic deals.

That shift more tightly restricts investor liquidity and their ability to withdraw their money. The move underlines the challenges surrounding liquidity and transparency in private markets, amid the ongoing push by private asset managers and alternative investment funds into the more liquid retail wealth space.

It follows a recent rise in redemption requests in some of Blue Owl's business development companies, according to a Bloomberg report.

Last November, Blue Owl Capital attempted to merge OBDC II with the larger, publicly-traded Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC) fund. Before abandoning its plans, Blue Owl halted redemptions in OBDC II until the deal — which could have brought losses of some 20% to investors — was completed. 

The episode rattled investors, sending Blue Owl Capital's shares lower.

Now, Blue Owl will use the proceeds from this sale to pay down debt and return capital to OBDC II shareholders, at up to $2.35 per share or approximately 30% of OBDC II's net asset value.

Elsewhere, the other funds — the OBDC and Blue Owl Technology Income Corp (OTIC) — each sold $400 million in assets, representing 2% and 6% of their respective portfolios.

""These sales consist of 97% senior secured debt investments with an average size of $5 million and include investments in 128 distinct portfolio companies across 27 industries,"" Blue Owl said in a statement.

""The largest industry represented is internet software and services at 13%, generally consistent with the industry composition of Blue Owl's overall direct lending strategy and reflecting continued confidence in the quality and valuations of these software investments.""

Logan Nicholson, president of OBDC II and OBDC, said the deal ""opportunistically"" delivers value to shareholders and, in OBDC II, provides a ""significant liquidity event"" while maintaining a diversified portfolio with strong earnings potential.

OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei had an awkward moment on Thursday as they chose not to hold hands during a group photo of political and tech leaders. 

They were on stage at the India AI Impact Summit, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, among others. Both had been keynote speakers.

Modi had lifted Altman and Pichai's hands before an applauding crowd, with others following suit. However, Altman and Amodei, who were next to each other, raised their fists instead of holding hands with one another. 

It comes as competition intensifies between ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Claude maker Anthropic, with both vying for their models to become the default choice for consumers globally. 

The companies have also recently traded shots over the potential use of adverts in AI models.

The image of Altman and Amodei opting out of holding hands quickly made the rounds on social media.

Siddharth Bhatia, cofounder of AI startup Puch AI, posted on X: ""When AGI? The day Dario and Sam hold hands.""

Justine Moore, an investing partner at Andreesen Horowitz, shared a picture with the words: ""When you're forced to do a group project with your opp.""

Last month, Anthropic released Super Bowl commercials that poked fun at OpenAI's plan to start testing ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S. 

Altman called the ads ""clearly dishonest,"" saying: ""I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.""

Anthropic's chief customer officer, Paul Smith, later told CNBC that it was focused on growing its business rather than making ""flashy headlines,"" in a veiled swipe at OpenAI.

Speaking at the summit after the photo, Altman told CNBC: ""We still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best.""

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI staff and researchers, including Amodei, who left the company after disagreements over its direction. The company has marketed itself as a ""safety-first"" alternative.

OpenAI and Anthropic have since raised billions of dollars of capital as they've competed for users, enterprise customers and market share.

During his speech at the summit on Thursday, Amodei discussed the ""serious risks"" associated with AI, including the autonomous behavior of AI systems, their potential misuse by individuals and governments, and the potential for economic displacement.

During his speech, Altman argued that the industry's understanding of AI safety should include ""societal resilience,"" adding: ""We believe no AI lab can deliver a good future on their own.""

Accenture has told senior staff they must regularly use its AI tools to be considered for promotions for leadership roles.

Associate directors and senior managers at the consultancy giant were informed that ""regular adoption"" of AI would be required to progress to leadership positions, according to an FT report. 

An Accenture spokesperson told CNBC the report was correct. They added: ""Our strategy is to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients and to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled, great place to work. 

""That requires the adoption of the latest tools and technologies to serve our clients most effectively.""

The spokesperson also confirmed that, as the FT reported, the policy had been set out in an internal email.

 ""Use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions,"" the email said, according to the FT. 

The FT reported that Accenture staff in 12 European countries were unaffected by the policy, as well as staff working in the division that handles U.S. government contracts. 

In September, Accenture outlined a restructuring strategy in which it said staff who are unable to reskill on AI would eventually be laid off.

On an earnings call, CEO Julie Sweet said all employees would be expected to ""retrain and retool"" at scale, adding that 550,000 workers had already been reskilled on the fundamentals of generative AI. Accenture employs a total of 780,000 people globally.

""Our No. 1 strategy is upskilling, given the skills we need, and we've had a lot of experience in upskilling, we're trying to, in a very compressed timeline, where we don't have a viable path for skilling, sort of exiting people so we can get more of the skills in we need,"" Sweet added.

Sweet told CNBC at the time: ""Our early investment in AI is really paying off.""

""Every CEO, board and the C-suite recognize that advanced AI is critical to the future. The challenge right now they're facing is that they're really excited about the technology and they're not yet AI ready for most companies,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

Accenture announced a string of partnerships and tools in recent months. Accenture partnered with OpenAI in December to give tens of thousands of its employees access to ChatGPT Enterprise and continue to upskill on AI. 

Accenture also partnered with Anthropic to train 30,000 employees on Claude AI tools, with tens of thousands of Accenture developers to use Claude Code for coding and AI-assisted work.

Other ventures include partnering with Palantir so that over 2,000 Accenture staff can get AI training using the software company's platforms.

Three Vietnamese airlines announced deals Thursday to buy nearly 100 Boeing aircraft during a visit by the head of the country's communist party, To Lam, to Washington, D.C.

The deals include commitments from Vietnam Airlines, Sun PhuQuoc Airways and VietJet, marking one of the largest civil aviation contracts announced by Vietnamese carriers.

Vietnam Airlines finalized an agreement to purchase 50 Boeing 737 MAX jets for $8 billion, a deal first announced in 2023.

Sun PhuQuoc Airways, a newly formed airline by the conglomerate Sun Group, also signed an agreement to purchase 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The airline, which began operations in November 2025, said the $22.5 billion deal represents Vietnam's largest wide-body aircraft order to date and its first direct purchase from Boeing.

Sun Group's Chairman Dang Minh Truong said in a statement that the aircraft would support long-haul expansion and help promote the resort island of Phu Quoc — where the company operates major tourism projects — as an international destination.

Budget carrier VietJet agreed to acquire six Boeing 737 jets through Griffin Global Asset Management in a financing agreement worth $965 million.

In a statement, the airline said the agreement ""marks a significant step in VietJet's strategy of diversifying international funding sources, while strengthening its financial capacity and capital structure according to global standards.""

The announcements were made ahead of Lam's attendance at the inaugural meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Board of Peace"" on Thursday, an initiative aimed at addressing global conflicts.

Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday that at least 20 member states had pledged more than $5 billion to support humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza, along with thousands of personnel for an International Stabilization Force to help police the war-torn territory.

In this article

The progress of Chinese tech companies across the entire stack is ""remarkable,"" OpenAI's Sam Altman told CNBC. 

Altman's comments come as China races against the U.S. to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) — where AI matches human capabilities — and roll out the technology across society.

The pace of technological advance in ""many fields,"" including AI, is ""amazingly fast,"" Altman said. In some areas Chinese tech companies are near the frontier, while in others they lag behind, he added.

The country is moving to scale homegrown chipmakers that it hopes could eventually rival the likes of Nvidia, and AI companies are seeing big rallies on stock exchanges as investors double down on their potential. 

Altman's not the only tech leader paying attention to China. 

American tech companies should ""worry a little bit"" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC on Wednesday.

OpenAI has been moving to develop revenue streams as its looks to provide a path to profitability for investors that have ploughed around $70 billion into the company, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom. The company is looking to wrap up a $100 billion fundraising round, sources told CNBC.

Adverts within ChatGPT is one avenue the company is exploring. 

""I think we still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best,"" Altman said, adding that plans are in their early stages.

""The ads that I have personally liked the most in recent years from tech [companies] have been sort of Instagram style ads where you discover something new that you might really like and otherwise wouldn't have known about,"" he said. ""I think we've got a real opportunity to push in that direction with ads in ChatGPT.""

OpenAI is initially planning to test adverts in the U.S., but will eventually roll out to other markets, Altman said.

While conversations around OpenAI's timelines on a path to profitability are swirling among market watchers, the company is still focused on growth right now, Altman told CNBC.

""We are growing at an extremely fast rate right now,"" he said. ""I think as long as we can have reasonable unit economics, we should focus on continuing to grow faster and faster, and we'll get profitable when we think we when we think it makes sense.""

In this article

The Trump administration has warned it would be ""very wise"" for Iran to make a deal, amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. 

It comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to address core U.S. demands during nuclear talks in Switzerland this week. Iran's foreign minister previously reported progress in the talks, saying the two countries had reached an understanding over the ""guiding principles"" for the negotiations.

Speaking at a news briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that there were ""many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,"" noting that the two countries remain ""very far apart"" on some issues.

U.S. President Donald Trump had a ""very successful"" operation last June, Leavitt said, when U.S. stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities as part of ""Operation Midnight Hammer.""

""The president has always been very clear though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option. And Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and this administration,"" Leavitt said. 

The White House has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, although U.S. media has reported that the military could be prepared to strike Iran as early as the weekend. 

Both the U.S. and Iran have increased military activity in the oil-producing Middle East region in recent weeks.

The U.S., for its part, has built up a significant presence of air and naval assets, while Iran has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz and announced joint naval drills with Russia in the Gulf of Oman, also known as the Sea of Oman.

Laura James, Middle East senior analyst at Oxford Analytica, described the current situation as ""extremely dangerous,"" with the U.S. and Iran ""certainly closer"" to an outright conflict than last week.

""The thing that is now a particular concern over the past 24 hours is the very rapid pace at which the United States is reinforcing its air power in the region. That, of course, can still be signaling and pressure for a particular diplomatic outcome,"" James told CNBC's ""Access Middle East"" on Thursday.

""But as more and more planes come in and more and more equipment comes in, that signaling gets more and more expensive. And therefore, the payoff you want for it in diplomatic terms has to be larger — and there is simply no sign Tehran can offer the absolute minimum that Washington is likely to demand,"" she added.  

Energy market participants have been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva, particularly as it relates to the Strait of Hormuz, a major international waterway that Iran partially closed on Tuesday citing ""security precautions."" 

Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points.

About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed. 

Oil prices were higher on Thursday, extending gains after settling up more than 4% in the previous session. 

International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery rose 1.5% to $71.41 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery stood 1.7% higher at $66.27.

In this article

Doordash's stock rallied on Thursday as Wall Street shook off disappointing fourth-quarter results and commended early progress in the food delivery platform's investment cycle. 

Shares initially fell about 10% in extended trading after earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines and the company issued disappointing profit guidance. 

In the first quarter, the company expects continued investments in Deliveroo, the British delivery platform it bought last year, to weigh on adjusted EBITDA. Doordash also anticipates a $20 million impact from recent U.S. winter storms and higher order costs driven by investments in longer-distance deliveries and cost increases in regulated markets. 

But Wall Street managed to overlook Doordash's subpar results as the company's investments start to show signs of an early payoff. 

""DASH's businesses are strong and accelerating, and unit economics are improving, giving it an ability to deliver more durable growth and invest,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients.

Nowak reiterated his confidence in the company's core U.S. restaurant business and highlighted improving unit economics and growth in newer verticals like retail, grocery and international.

Bank of America analyst Justin Post said the company is ""executing well,"" and its Deliveroo purchase sets it up to double its U.S. total addressable market globally.

Investors had previously sounded the alarm on the company's supercharged investment cycle. 

Last quarter, shares slumped to their worst day ever after Doordash said it planned to spend more on its new tech platform and innovations like autonomous delivery.

Doordash finance chief Ravi Inukonda said during an earnings call on Wednesday that the company is making good progress on its tech stack overhaul, and management expects the majority of spending to occur in 2026. 

""We're being very disciplined,"" Inukonda told analysts. ""We're investing in areas where we're improving the products to ultimately drive both scale as well as profitability.""

Some of those investments include creating warehouses to bring inventory closer to customers and fulfillment services.

Doordash also said it had a record number of subscribers in the fourth quarter and 2025.

Former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life imprisonment Thursday after being found guilty of leading an insurrection during his declaration of martial law in December 2024. 

The ruling, delivered by Seoul Central District Court Judge Jee Kui-youn, was lighter than the death penalty prosecutors sought at the trial's final hearing in January. The ruling was aired live on South Korea's major broadcasters.

Jee said in the verdict that Yoon led an insurrection and committed acts to subvert the country's constitutional order.

The court added that Yoon ""took the lead in planning the crime and involved a large number of people,"" and that it was ""difficult to see any sign of remorse from the defendant, who also refused to appear in court.""

Yoon had previously reportedly refused to appear in court for questioning last year. 

The court also found Yoon had ordered South Korea's military to capture individuals during the martial law declaration, including the current president Lee Jae Myung. 

Yoon also had the intention to ""paralyze"" the country's parliament by deploying troops to blockade the National Assembly and arrest key politicians, Jee said.

Five others were also sentenced, including former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

The defendants may appeal the ruling within a week. 

The sentence follows a separate ruling on Jan. 16, when Yoon was given a five-year prison term for attempting to obstruct his arrest after he was impeached and suspended from office. 

Other senior officials have been sentenced over the failed martial law bid. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to 23 years in prison, while former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min received a seven-year sentence.

Yoon was the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested in an operation involving over 3,000 police personnel that involved a standoff with presidential security agents. 

During the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said Yoon declared martial law ""with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,"" according to South Korean media reports.

Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, arguing the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to ""safeguard freedom and sovereignty.""

He imposed South Korea's first instance of martial law in 44 years during a late-night address on Dec. 3, claiming that the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea was engaging in ""anti-state activities"" and colluding with ""North Korean communists.""

Troops were deployed to the country's National Assembly, while soldiers and police clashed with protesters outside the compound. 

Television footage showed special forces breaking windows to gain access to the chamber, while parliamentary staffers used furniture to barricade doors.

Then-defense minister Kim Yong-hyun also reportedly ordered troops to ""pull people inside the National Assembly building outside.""

But the martial law order was overturned within three hours, after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers gathered in the chamber and unanimously voted to do so. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.

He was impeached 11 days later and removed from office on April 4, 2025.

U.S. President Donald Trump has once again criticized the U.K.'s plan to hand the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius, telling the country not to ""give away"" the territory where a strategic U.S.-U.K. military base is located. 

""DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, saying he'd been telling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he should ""not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia.""

The U.K. agreed in May 2025 to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which has long-disputed the U.K.'s acquisition and ownership of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean. 

The deal would see the U.K. lease back the military base it shares with the U.S. on the largest island on the archipelago, Diego Garcia, for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year, for an initial 99-year period.

The U.S. previously voiced support for the deal and, on Tuesday, the Department of State said it ""supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago.""

Trump is not the biggest fan of the Chagos deal, however, and he has seesawed on the issue of ceding the territory to Mauritius.

In January, he called the deal ""an act of great stupidity,"" but he was more conciliatory in early February, stating: ""I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make,"" he commented on Truth Social.

""However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,"" he added.

On Wednesday, he returned to his negative position on the agreement, saying that he'd told Starmer ""that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries.""

""He is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease with whoever it is that is 'claiming' Right, Title, and Interest to Diego Garcia, strategically located in the Indian Ocean,"" Trump said.

The president suggested that giving the islands away was an act of ""Wokeism,"" as it had come after the U.K. faced sustained international and legal pressure to relinquish the islands, and to redress its thorny colonial history on the islands. 

""We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them,"" Trump said.

The U.K. has repeatedly said that it ""will never compromise on our national security"" when it comes to the Chagos deal.

Trump also suggested Wednesday that the joint military base on the island could be vital if military action was taken against Iran — if the Islamic Republic did not agree a new nuclear deal during current talks with the U.S.

""Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime — An attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries,"" Trump said.

The U.S. and Mauritius are due to hold talks on the Chagos deal next week, from Feb. 23-25, with the U.S. Department of State noting that the discussions"" underscore the continued importance of the Chagos archipelago and the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia to our national security."" 

""The discussions will focus on bilateral security cooperation and effective implementation of security arrangements for the base to ensure its long-term, secure operation,"" the department said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","McGlone shifts bitcoin forecast to $28,000 after critics blast $10,000 call as 'nonsense'","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/19/mike-mcglone-softens-bitcoin-downside-target-to-usd28-000-after-backlash-over-usd10-000-call","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:28:00 GMT","

Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone appeared to walk back his $10,000 forecast for bitcoin, instead highlighting $28,000 after being challenged on social media and accused of being an alarmist whose “nonsensical” forecasts put real capital at risk.

Earlier this week, McGlone warned that collapsing crypto prices could signal broader financial stress and that bitcoin could revert toward $10,000 if U.S. equities peak and recession follows. He framed the token as a high-beta risk asset vulnerable to a breakdown in the post-2008 “buy the dip” regime.

But in a subsequent post on X, McGlone pointed to $28,000 as a more probable level based on historical price distribution, a notable shift from his earlier base case. He also said his analysis “suggests why not to buy bitcoin or most risk assets.”

His correction upward also followed being challenged to a debate by market analyst and AdLunam co-founder, Jason Fernandes on X and LinkedIn posts.

Fernandes, whose LinkedIn challenge was liked but not accepted by McGlone, told CoinDesk his broader critique still stands, even after the Bloomberg analyst revised his target. “$28K is obviously more realistic than $10K,” Fernandes said. “Proportionately fewer things need to go wrong for $28K than $10K.”

Mati Greenspan, a market analyst and the Quantum Economics founder, said $28,000 was still unlikely, “but in markets we never want to rule anything out.”

Greenspan had also called McGlone out in a post on X following his lower forecast, saying, “Mr. @mikemcglone11 would have you believe that an asset with trillions of dollars in monthly volumes could crash to a market cap of 200 billion.” He said the forecast was “literally nonsense.""

Fernandes previously estimated a more likely reset in the $40,000 to $50,000 range absent a systemic liquidity shock. He noted that $28,000 now sits closer to his lower bound than to McGlone's original call. “It bears mentioning that he has adjusted his near-term outlook closer to my low end than his previous prediction,” Fernandes said.

At stake in the debate is more than price targets. Fernandes said that deterministic, alarmist framing can materially influence positioning and put “real capital at risk,” particularly in reflexive markets like crypto.

A former investment fund chief who embezzled almost $40 million in Bitcoin from Georgia's former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili has been released from prison.

The man, the Georgian-Russian national Giorgi Bachiashvili, was jailed for 11 years in absentia after fleeing the country in March.

He was later arrested on the border with Azerbaijan and transferred to prison to serve his sentence, with courts ordering him to serve a further four years for illegal flight, the Russian-language media outlet Vzglad reported.

But after striking a plea deal, Bachiashvili's sentence was reduced, and he was allowed to walk free.

“Bachiashvili has fully admitted his guilt to all the criminal charges,” prosecutors told Georgian broadcaster Channel 1. “He also fully cooperated with the investigation and has paid compensation for the damages incurred.”

The development comes as the popularity of Bitcoin mining continues to grow in Georgia.

Regulatory data published late last year shows the Bitcoin mining sector's power consumption tripled in the first 10 months of 2025, reaching 617 million kilowatt-hours. This represents 5% of the nation's total electricity consumption.

Ivanishvili is one of the richest people in Georgia and wields enormous political influence. He serves as the honorary chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party.

In the early 2010s, Ivanishvili hired Bachiashvili to manage his own and his businesses' assets.

In 2015, Ivanishvili's banking firm Cartu loaned Bachiashvili the Bitcoin after the latter said he would use the cryptocurrency to launch a crypto mining firm. Instead of doing so, prosecutors said, Bachiashvili embezzled the coins.

Prosecutors also indicted Bachiashvili's parents, accusing them of aiding their son's efforts to launder $3.5 million worth of Cartu's Bitcoin.

Prosecution officials have also dropped these charges.

Prosecutors said that, under the terms of the plea deal, Bachiashvili's sentence was reduced to a suspended one-year jail term. Bachiashvili has also agreed to pay a $19,000 fine.

Most of Georgia's data centres focus their efforts on crypto mining, with the majority of miners based in Tbilisi and Kutaisi's free industrial zones.

Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, offered a blunt take on digital assets, arguing that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin BTC$66,510.36 and stablecoins, have yet to prove real utility.

Speaking at the 2026 Midwest Economic Outlook Summit in Fargo, North Dakota on Thursday, he contrasted the everyday utility of artificial intelligence (AI) tools with cryptocurrencies.

""Crypto has been around for more than a decade, and it's utterly useless,"" he said, while AI ""has real long term potential for the U.S. economy.""

After asking the audience who had used AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini in the past week, Kashkari posed a second question: ""raise your hand if you've bought or sold something with bitcoin.""

When the discussion turned to payments and stablecoins, Kashkari said he's unconvinced the technology improves on existing financial rails. ""I hear these words and I like, it's just, it's like a buzzword salad,"" he said. ""What can I do with the stablecoin that I can't do with Venmo today?""

Pressed on stablecoins being used for cheaper and faster cross-border payments, Kashkari argued that proponents quickly concede that those benefits aren't aimed at U.S. consumers. While he admitted that adoption in emerging countries is rising, the said the tech still faces technical problems.

While stablecoin advocates promise instant transfers, he said, recipients still need to convert into local currency for everyday payments like buying groceries, which can be expensive.

Kashkari's skepticism stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration, which has increasingly championed bitcoin and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins as key strategic tools.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued that regulated stablecoins can extend the greenback's dominance in global payments and reinforce its status as the world's reserve currency, strengthening U.S. financial influence. President Trump also signed an executive order in March to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, which Bessent was an advocate for.

Ethereum is attempting to push back above the $2,000 level as the broader crypto market navigates persistent uncertainty and ongoing selling pressure. Recent price action reflects a fragile recovery effort rather than a confirmed trend reversal, with volatility remaining elevated and traders cautious after months of corrective momentum. The $2,000 threshold has become a key psychological and technical battleground, shaping short-term sentiment as investors evaluate liquidity conditions, macro signals, and derivatives positioning.

A recent CryptoQuant analysis offers additional insight into evolving market dynamics, particularly within Ethereum's derivatives landscape. Data tracking the Estimated Leverage Ratio on Binance shows a clear shift in trader behavior. The indicator recently dropped to around 0.557, marking its lowest reading since last December. This decline follows a period of heightened leverage, when the ratio peaked near 0.675, reflecting a more aggressive risk environment earlier in the cycle.

The reduction in leverage suggests traders are scaling back risk exposure, closing highly leveraged positions, or moving toward more conservative strategies. Such transitions often occur during consolidation phases, when markets attempt to stabilize after volatility spikes.

Declining Leverage Points To Potential Market Stabilization

The analyst further notes that the recent decline in Ethereum's estimated leverage ratio reflects a broader reduction in speculative risk across the derivatives market. Lower leverage typically indicates that traders are trimming highly leveraged positions or closing them altogether, shifting toward more conservative exposure. Historically, such deleveraging phases have often preceded the formation of new price bases, as market participants prioritize capital preservation over short-term speculative gains.

The drop from roughly 0.675 to around 0.557 is therefore not simply a minor technical fluctuation. Instead, it signals a meaningful shift in market sentiment. Periods characterized by elevated leverage tend to amplify volatility and increase the probability of abrupt liquidations. Conversely, declining leverage generally corresponds with calmer market conditions, where price movements are less driven by forced liquidations and more by underlying demand dynamics.

From a medium-term perspective, this transition may be constructive. Reduced leverage can create a healthier foundation for price discovery, particularly if accompanied by strengthening spot demand. In this context, the combination of lower leverage readings and relatively stable price action suggests the market could be undergoing a consolidation or repositioning phase. Such environments often precede more decisive directional moves once liquidity and sentiment conditions align.

Ethereum Price Remains Under Pressure Below Key Averages

Ethereum continues to trade near the $2,000 level after a sharp corrective move that followed its late-2025 highs. The chart shows a clear bearish structure, with price consistently printing lower highs since the October peak while failing to sustain recoveries above key moving averages. Recent attempts to stabilize have produced only shallow rebounds, indicating persistent selling pressure and cautious market positioning.

Notably, ETH remains below its short-, medium-, and long-term moving averages, which are all trending downward. This alignment typically reflects sustained bearish momentum and suggests that rallies may continue to face resistance unless the price can reclaim these levels decisively. The 200-day moving average, currently well above spot price, stands out as a major structural resistance zone.

Volume data also provides context. The most recent sell-off was accompanied by a noticeable spike in trading activity, often associated with liquidation events or accelerated distribution. Since then, volume has moderated, consistent with a consolidation phase rather than an immediate reversal.

From a technical perspective, the $1,900–$2,000 range now acts as a short-term stabilization zone. However, failure to hold this area could expose lower support levels, while a sustained break above nearby resistance would be needed to signal improving momentum.

Bitcoin BTC$66,328.29 and ether (ETH) both rose around 0.9% overnight while the broader altcoin market lagged on Thursday.

BTC was recently trading at $67,000 following a brief touch of $66,000 on Wednesday. Ether, at $1,970 after bouncing off $1,924, is struggling to break through the psychological $2,000 price level.

Volatility has waned since the selloff on Feb. 5. Two subsequent weeks of consolidation have left investors wondering whether this is the calm before another stormy move to the downside, or whether the market is establishing a macro low before rising back toward 2025 levels.

World Liberty Financial's Mar-a-Lago forum on Wednesday failed to provide a bullish catalyst despite being attended by CFTC Chairman Michael Selig and executives from companies including Goldman Sachs. 

From a macro perspective, bitcoin remains in a downtrend since hitting a record high of $126,600 in early October. It has notched a series of lower highs and lower lows with periods of choppy consolidation in between each major move.

The collaboration aligns with Black Titan's DAT+ strategy, which is backed by a $200 million convertible note facility, and may take the form of a joint venture, referral agreement, or other structure.

No peer stocks in the provided industry list showed momentum flags, suggesting BTTC's move reflected company-specific blockchain and DAT+ developments rather than a sector-wide rotation.

Recent news centers on the DAT+ crypto treasury pivot and related financing, with generally positive strategic tone but mixed short-term price alignment, including one notable negative reaction to a major funding announcement.

Over the last month, BTTC has repeatedly communicated a strategic shift toward digital-asset infrastructure and its DAT+ framework, backed by a $200M convertible note and securities purchase agreements. Announcements on Jan 20 highlighted digital-first banking and accessible investing, both coinciding with strong positive price reactions. Subsequent updates on Jan 23 and Feb 3 detailed institutional capital raises and positioning as a liquidity provider, while a Feb 11 note elaborated on DeFi deployment mechanics. Today's PyratzLabs MOU fits into this ongoing build-out of BTTC's digital-asset strategy.


      This announcement extends BTTC's DAT+ strategy by adding an exploratory MOU with PyratzLabs, effective February 12, 2026, and backed by an existing $200M convertible note facility. It emphasizes collaboration across the blockchain value chain without committing to a specific structure yet. In context of recent regulatory filings and prior DeFi-focused updates, key items to watch include any definitive partnership agreements, evolution of funding terms, and how actively managed digital-asset positions translate into reported financial performance.

							ColoradoBiz Staff							//February 18, 2026//
 



DENVER — Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday announced plans to auction 150 Colorado-themed nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, as part of the state's 150th birthday celebration.




Polis made the announcement at the ETHDenver conference in partnership with the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. The auction is scheduled to begin June 1, 2026.

State officials said the NFT sale is part of the broader America 250-Colorado 150 initiative, which was created to encourage residents statewide to participate in commemorative events marking both the nation's 250th anniversary and Colorado's 150th anniversary.

“Here in Colorado innovation is part of our code,” Polis said. “Today I am excited to announce the launch of 150 Colorado NFTs, a unique way to highlight artists and celebrate our great state.”

Proceeds from the NFT sales will support other America 250-Colorado 150 commemorative efforts.

Polis also appeared at the Colorado Technology Association's annual Tech Summit and APEX Awards, where he presented the Bob Newman Lifetime Achievement Award to David Cohen and Seth Levine for their work in advancing technology in Colorado.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with steganography? Why not? If secret information can be hidden in any code, adding it to digital tokens like 1Sat Ordinals is just another step. 3DOrdi, the platform for creators to make and manage NFT collections, has added this feature to create a new kind of token utility, which it calls “steganordinals.” It's not full spycraft just yet, but the technology has plenty of potential use cases to experiment with.

3DOrdi‘s initial experiment is two-sided cards. Anyone can view both sides of the card, but a secret image is hidden on the back. Only the creator can reveal what's hidden there and pass that information on to a new owner.

It does this by utilizing the most common and widespread steganography technique, known as “Least Significant Bit” (LSB).

Using this technique, “we get one step closer to true digital ownership, where access to information is scarce, not the information itself,” said Jorge Pelaez, creator of 3DOrdi. “Now I want to see what kind of collections will emerge from on-chain content creators using this tool. It'll be fun.”

Japanese NFT artist KURO has been among the first to try out the new feature, adding it as an extra treat to anyone buying and collecting 1sat Ordinals. Pelaez also noted that “Smart Soy,” a DJ from the Netherlands, has also created a collection using the Steganordinals process.

""Steganordinals,"" which have been a hot topic on @treechatai recently, can now be created in @3dordi !Select Collection Item from Minting Section and select Steganordinals (Two-Sided Ordinals), and you'll be able to select the card back and upload a secret image. Currently,… https://t.co/5jwTVJb61a pic.twitter.com/9NnXP5aeM6

The first use case Pelaez suggested was in trading card games, where cards could contain secret stats, additional abilities, or extra lore only the owner can view. The hidden side of art collectibles might have “making-of” stories or a higher-resolution version of the original image, just for its owner.

The design for the “backs” of the four card types available was made by Switzerland-based artist PX1 and is based on the “Dordy” mascot. For the record, PX1 was also the creator of the very first token to use the 1Sat Ordinals protocol, back in 2023—that famous “inscription #1” NFT currently has a selling price of $1.19 million.

From the ancient practice of steganography to modern times

Steganography is the practice of “hiding” additional information in another message or block of text. It can be hidden wherever or however the data can be stored, even in physical objects. If done well, the hidden information shouldn't be accessible to anyone looking at the original message/object, and its very presence wouldn't be apparent.

The technique has been very useful in spycraft and in passing secret information for thousands of years. It also has plenty of mundane uses in modern times. For example, some widely used printers mark tiny yellow dots on every page they print, in a unique pattern that identifies the machine's serial number. It can be used to bypass censorship mechanisms. It's also a popular technique for hiding malware within otherwise benign computer code.

If anyone's concerned that bad actors might attempt to hide malware in collectible NFTs, 3DOrdi is only allowing image files for the “hidden side” of its tokens.

With the right security practices, hiding information in NFTs like 1Sat Ordinals could have other uses beyond just entertainment. Digital tickets for concerts and other events could display a visible ticket while containing hidden information, such as seat details or VIP perks. Beyond that, it's up to the imagination, since steganography in NFTs would have as many use cases as steganography itself.

The 3DOrdi platform has been popular in the NFT collectibles crowd in recent times, especially with the token community on social networks like Treechat. Users have used its tools to create token series and even embed mini-apps and games inside social media posts. It also has a royalties feature that lets creators earn extra “fan income” through micropayments for likes and other interactions, rather than just from selling the token itself.

We welcome the Court of Appeal's (CoA) ruling that we have succeeded in our appeal against the decision of the Upper Tribunal on DSG Retail Limited (DSG). 

In its judgment published today, the CoA supports our grounds for appeal, reinstating a clear interpretation of the legal responsibility on organisations to keep personal data secure.   

In 2020, we fined DSG £500,000 after a cyber attack affected the personal data of at least 14 million people.  

Following appeals by DSG to the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) and Upper Tribunal (UT), we appealed to the CoA in 2024 to seek clarification from the court on an important point of data protection law.  

The CoA judgment confirms that DSG was required to take appropriate security measures to protect personal data from unauthorised access – regardless of whether people could be identified from the data exfiltrated by the hackers.  

Binnie Goh, ICO General Counsel, said:

“Today's judgment is a significant victory, bringing much-needed clarity for people affected by cyber attacks as well as industry. 

“We welcome the CoA's confirmation that organisations must protect all personal data they process, regardless of how it might be used or exploited by hackers. This recognises that even if hackers can't identify people individually from stolen datasets, cyber attacks can and do still cause real harm.  

“With the rising threat of cyber crime, this decision strengthens our ability to take robust action in the future and sends a clear message to all organisations: you have a protective duty to safeguard the personal data you hold.”  

While this case is rooted in the Data Protection Act 1998, the legal interpretation of the security duty by the CoA offers an important guide to similar requirements in the current data protection regime.   

Now the point of law has been clarified by the CoA, the case will return to the FTT at a later date to apply this interpretation to the facts of the DSG cyber attack.

From 19 June 2026, the Data Use and Access Act 2025 (DUAA) will introduce a new, statutory ""right to complain"" for individuals in the UK regarding their data protection rights. This right, set out in the new section 164A of the Data Protection Act 2018 and as inserted by DUAA, requires individuals to lodge a complaint directly with an organisation first before they can escalate it to the ICO. 

The ICO has published guidance setting out how organisations should handle data protection complaints which we have summarised below.

What is a data protection complaint?

A data protection complaint arises when someone believes an organisation has infringed data protection legislation because of the way it has handled their personal data. For example, a complaint may relate to the way a data subject access requests was handled, what data security measures were applied to store someone's data in the event of a data breach, or how an organisation has collected or used someone's personal data. If an organisation is unsure whether someone is making a data protection complaint then they should ask for clarification.

As with other data subject rights requests, complaints can be made via any channel and individuals do not need to use legal terms or quote applicable legislation to make them. 

What do organisations need to do?

Organisations need to inform individuals about their right to complain:

Individuals need to be given a mechanism through which to make their complaint, for example, via email, phone or a complaints portal. Existing data subject rights or complaints processes can be adapted for organisations to meet their obligations. Although not required, providing a written complaints procedure can make it easier for individuals to understand how to raise a complaint, which in turn helps make an organisation in meeting these obligations. 

Organisations should ensure that staff can recognise a data protection complaint and know how to handle it appropriately. This includes understanding where complaints should be directed and ensuring that handling of data protection complaints forms part of internal data protection training.

How should organisations handle complaints?

Organisations must have a process for handling data protection complaints which includes:

The 30-day time limit to acknowledge the complaint begins from the day after the complaint is received even if the following day is a weekend or public holiday. If the 30th day falls on a weekend or public holiday, the acknowledgement can be sent the following working day.

Investigation into the complaint should begin from the day the complaint is received and enquiries into the complaint must be conducted without unjustifiable or excessive delay. The scope and depth of those enquiries must be appropriate based on the circumstances of each complaint, and organisations must be able to justify the approach they take. The overall time period to respond is likely to be affected by the complexity and scale of the issue and the level of harm the individual has suffered. 

Organisations must keep individuals updated on the progress of their investigation without undue delay. For example, if an investigation is likely to take a long time, the organisation needs to follow up on the initial acknowledgment to make the individual aware of this. 

How should organisations respond?

Once the investigation is complete, the outcome should be communicated to the individual and the organization should clearly explain what they did to resolve the complaint and any actions it took as a result of its investigation. If complainants are unhappy with the outcome, organisations could consider clarifying their decision and, as best practice, provide details about how to complain to the ICO. 

What should organisations do after the response has been shared?

After the response is shared, organisations should ensure their internal records are updated with details about how they dealt with the complaint, including the date it was received, when the acknowledgment was sent, details of the investigation, the outcome of the complaint and actions taken as a result. 

Finally, organisations should consider reviewing lessons learned to prevent future, similar data protection issues.

The bank sees no need to deploy a retail CBDC anytime soon, but it will explore wholesale options.

The South African Reserve Bank says that although retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could help address gaps in the country's payment system, developing one is not a priority for now. 

Instead, the bank will focus on strengthening its existing digital payment innovations to improve the financial system.

The South African Reserve Bank disclosed this in a newly released position paper and background note, published together late last month to outline its recent work on CBDCs and digital payments.

According to the bank, despite innovations in digital payments and growth in their adoption and use, cash remains the most preferred medium of exchange. 

Regardless, the bank is unsure whether it can run a CBDC project alongside other initiatives it has embarked upon to develop the country's National Payments System (NPS). 

SARB is unconvinced that CBDCs can displace cash as a preferred method of payment because a viable CBDC would need several other factors in place for it to be effective. 

South Africa has joined the list of African countries delaying the rollout of a CBDC after initially signaling an intention to launch one.

The IMF says stablecoin issuance has grown to $300 billion in 2025, but increased adoption poses financial risks if left unchecked. 

Parents maintain full control of these accounts designed to teach crypto and financial literacy to children aged 17 and under. 

Adoption is on the rise, but with increased adoption comes financial stability risks that the bank is now looking to counteract. 

SARB said the absence of a complete regulatory framework for crypto assets and stablecoins remains a key vulnerability in South Africa's financial system.

Epstein's 2010s emails show Gensler talks, XRP/XLM bets, CBDC and stablecoin funding links.

Newly released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein case contain references to communications involving cryptocurrency policy discussions and Gary Gensler, according to reports published this week.

The documents include emails dated 2018 that reportedly mention conversations between Epstein and individuals connected to policy and academic circles in the cryptocurrency sector. Gensler, who later served as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, appears among the names referenced in the materials.

According to the reports, the files contain correspondence suggesting Epstein discussed arranging a meeting with Gensler regarding cryptocurrency topics. Emails from 2018 indicate Epstein told former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that Gensler had arrived early for crypto-related discussions, according to the documents. Summers reportedly responded that he knew Gensler and considered him intelligent.

No documents released to date have established a direct connection between Epstein and any specific cryptocurrency decision or project, according to available reports. However, records suggest Epstein invested millions in early cryptocurrency ventures, including approximately $3 million in Coinbase in 2014, reports stated.

Some emails reportedly referenced XRP and Stellar, leading to speculation about possible investments in those projects, though the documents do not provide clear confirmation, according to observers.

Additional claims in the reports suggest Epstein provided funding for U.S. central bank digital currency pilot programs through MIT and certain Federal Reserve Banks. Gensler taught at MIT during that period and worked in academic policy circles before entering government service and participating in the development of U.S. cryptocurrency regulation.

Reports also indicate Epstein explored early stablecoin-related investments, including Circle, through connections associated with Brock Pierce. Pierce reportedly requested Epstein's assistance in connecting with Lawrence Summers, according to accounts of the correspondence.

The documents suggest Epstein maintained investments in private cryptocurrency ventures while maintaining relationships with academic and policy circles involved in digital currency regulation, according to analysts reviewing the materials. The timing of these connections has drawn attention as they occurred before cryptocurrency markets achieved mainstream adoption.

Topline: An Abu Dhabi–backed blockchain project is moving to embed itself into Africa's financial infrastructure through a planned integration with M-Pesa, the continent's dominant mobile money platform, Semafor reports.

The details: The partnership would place blockchain directly inside payment systems already used daily by tens of millions of Africans, sidestepping the adoption hurdles that have slowed crypto-native products.

Zoom out: The move fits a wider trend of African fintech firms expanding into blockchain infrastructure, often by layering the technology onto established payment systems rather than building parallel systems from scratch.

Topline: South Africa's Reserve Bank says retail CBDCs could address payment system gaps but won't pursue one for now, choosing instead to focus on existing digital payment initiatives. (Details)

Quick facts: In a recent paper, the bank said CBDCs could improve financial inclusion and make payments faster.

Why the pause? The bank is already deep into other efforts to modernize how money moves.

The concerns: Beyond timing, SARB has real doubts about whether a CBDC can replace cash anytime soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","China Launches Comprehensive ""RAW"" Regulatory Framework for Digital Assets","https://financefeeds.com/china-launches-comprehensive-raw-regulatory-framework-for-digital-assets/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:32:53 GMT","

On February 6, 2026, Chinese financial authorities, led by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), officially launched a transformative regulatory framework known as the “RAW” package. This designation refers to the three pillars of the new policy: Real-world assets (RWA), All virtual currencies, and Wallet-based digital yuan. While the framework reiterates the country's longstanding “ironclad” ban on domestic retail cryptocurrency speculation and mining, it introduces a highly structured “compliant narrow gate” for the tokenization of real-world assets serving the real economy. By explicitly including RWA tokenization within the core of national regulation, China has signaled a transition from a reactive “campaign-style” clearing of crypto activities toward a proactive era of institutional construction. This move aims to harness the efficiency of blockchain technology for asset securitization and cross-border trade while maintaining an absolute monopoly on monetary sovereignty through the upgraded digital yuan (e-CNY) ecosystem.

A major component of the RAW framework is the 2026 update to the digital yuan's development model, which officially transitioned the e-CNY from a “digital cash” pilot into a “digital deposit money” system. Under this new structure, digital yuan balances held in commercial bank wallets are now classified as bank deposit liabilities, protected by the national deposit insurance system and included in the required reserve framework. This shift ensures that the digital currency is fully embedded within the traditional banking architecture, allowing commercial banks to handle wallet issuance, security, and anti-money laundering compliance while the PBOC maintains control over the core technical standards. By late 2025, the digital yuan had already processed over 16.7 trillion yuan in transaction volume, and the new framework is designed to scale this infrastructure further into public services, education, and healthcare. This “resilience-first” approach allows China to provide the benefits of programmable, smart-contract-based transactions without the financial disintermediation risks associated with decentralized stablecoins or private cryptocurrencies.

The RAW framework also clarifies China's strategy for the tokenization of real-world assets, such as infrastructure concessions, commodities, and real estate income rights. Domestic RWA activities remain strictly prohibited unless conducted through specific, authority-approved financial market infrastructure, effectively making Hong Kong the primary “operational interface” for this sector. The framework permits mainland enterprises to use cross-border structures, including Hong Kong-based special purpose vehicles, to issue tokenized asset-backed securities (ABS) to global investors. These activities are subject to rigorous filings, data governance, and foreign-exchange controls to prevent “technological black channels” from circumventing capital restrictions. By positioning Hong Kong as the bridge between Chinese assets and global liquidity, the RAW framework seeks to reduce reliance on traditional correspondent banking chains and improve the speed of international settlement. As the first batch of licensed stablecoin issuers prepares to launch in Hong Kong in March 2026, the RAW initiative serves as a definitive blueprint for a hybrid digital economy where centralized oversight and blockchain-based efficiency coexist within a tightly controlled, state-led ecosystem.

  The best argument for the digital euro is to discourage ghosts of the euro crisis from returning to haunt Europe


Why does Europe need a digital euro? Supporters of the plan offer various rationales. These include independence from American payment providers, security in case those American providers cut off access, the convenience of digital cash, now that notes and coins are used less, and offline sales. But there is a bigger and better reason: monetary sovereignty and the credibility of the euro itself.

The European Central Bank needs to be the anchor for all euros, digital included. The European Union should not take the risk that a public void triggers the private sector to develop something that catches on and becomes widespread, then collapses and threatens financial stability. In other words, the EU cannot afford to not have a digital euro.

It all boils down to credibility. If there is a digital euro, it will be easier for the ECB to differentiate between its own integrity and market ventures, and thus to defend the currency while letting market discipline run its course.

The euro is still young. It is not rooted in a common fiscal policy, a full-fledged bank deposit insurance system or a permanent deep and liquid safe asset. Mostly, investors appreciate the euro area's many accomplishments. But there have been times – the 2010-2015 crisis period, for example – when the currency's inherent fragmentation has become a significant vulnerability. Rather than weighing whether, say, an Italian bond is as good as one from Cyprus, or what the spread between Estonia and Germany should be, investors just run.

The United States has more room for manoeuvre because the dollar is the world's dominant currency and there is more integration at home. If a startup or an emerging-market country ruins itself using dollars, that company or country's poor management gets the blame. Fingers are not pointed at the dollar or the Federal Reserve.

But if the same happens to a euro-using company or country, the repercussions could be felt by the euro itself. For example, a private-sector stablecoin becoming the market default and then stumbling could trigger renewed fear of a euro-area breakup. This could be because of imbalances in the sovereign bonds held as backing assets, alarming investors about diverging credit risk among euro countries. Or a more general run could be prompted by breaking a peg, in the same way that failing money-market funds have set off crises before. Other factors not yet on the radar could also arise.

The ECB will surely monitor these risks. But it will be better able to prevent and contain them if it already occupies all senior digital currency positions. This means a wholesale digital euro for cross-border payment and settlement and a retail version for everyday use – with the main reason for this distinction being process, not a difference in need. The ECB can do a wholesale version by itself, while retail money requires EU legislation alongside central bank planning. 

Digital-euro supporters often argue that the EU should not depend on Visa and Mastercard and needs a homegrown alternative to assure payment sovereignty. This argument has not convinced the sceptics. Opponents say the private sector is capable of generating more options to meet demand, and they note that the EU already has a strong bank-transfer protocol and widely available instant payments.

Furthermore, in the unlikely event of Washington moving to cut off access to the card networks, many other things would likely have already gone wrong, including the fracturing of NATO and an end to decades of security cooperation. In that context, having to pay with cash or direct bank debit would be a manageable problem.

In progressing to the digital euro, the EU should therefore make monetary sovereignty the top priority. With sufficient investor confidence, the euro can maintain its status as a reliable store of value, unit of account and means of payment. This, in turn, will position the euro to increase its international role. 

Even a weak dollar is still the global reference point, because financial plumbing is more important than comparative value when it comes to managing foreign reserves. To the extent that global central banks seek to protect themselves from US political risk, they buy gold or consult with the Fed, rather than making big moves into other currencies.

After the euro crisis, it took time and huge amounts of rescue money for the world to once again see the euro area as a thriving monetary union. The EU should build out its financial infrastructure to hold on to those gains. The retail and wholesale digital euro are vital to that process.

For luxury travel agencies, collecting money is surprisingly expensive. 

Transaction costs — once foreign exchange fees, intermediary charges, and reconciliation time are combined — routinely run between eight and ten percent. Stablecoin transactions, by contrast, typically cost under one percent. 





That gap is the reason behind a move that didn't exactly make a splash when 360 Private Travel announced it would begin accepting cryptocurrency for client payments in early February.









Released on LinkedIn and Instagram over the weekend, the reaction was a couple dozen likes and barely any comment — just a short statement outlining the use of stablecoins, a brief description, and a few slides about faster, more efficient transactions. The muted response, however, may say more about the industry's lacking familiarity with crypto announcements than about the significance of this one.

Crypto and digital currency have, after all, been hovering around the edges of luxury travel for a few years. News about its development has been sporadic at best: a hotel announcement here, a boutique agency there, and perhaps a handful of exceptional cases that have never quite caught on to inspire broader adoption across the industry.





What makes 360 Private Travel's announcement different isn't novelty, but a sign of a more significant shift in the thinking — as well as the appetite — of an agency to take control of its financial future.

360 Private Travel is now perhaps the largest luxury travel agency to formally integrate digital currency into its payments structure. Until now, only a small number of agencies have publicly acknowledged doing so, including Globe7, as profiled by Luxury Travel Advisor last year as part of that agency's London debut.

In that context, 360 Private Travel's move stands out not because it's a first, but because it is materially larger, more global, and more deliberate about why it's adopting crypto at all.

“We've seen more and more of our HNW clients asking for this over the last six to nine months,” said James Turner, CEO of 360 Private Travel, in a video interview with LTA shortly following the announcement. “We reached the conclusion that we should be doing this. It's the right time to do it, but it has to be done correctly.”

The framing is notable since this is about client response, not branding. But one other critical distinction also sits at the center of 360's approach.

The immediate association when anything about digital currency comes up is volatility. This, however, is not about Bitcoin or speculation. Instead, the agency is accepting stablecoins: digital currencies designed to maintain a fixed value, pegged to fiat currency — typically major ones such as the U.S. dollar or the euro.

“This is not a wildly fluctuating asset,” Turner said. “Ours is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which is the currency we deal with mostly internationally.”

“If we speak about stablecoin…the risk is near to zero,” confirmed Simone Urracci via email. 

Urracci is a private travel designer at DreamsTeam, a high-end agency based in Milan who has been researching the potential of digital currencies for at least a couple of years. 

“With 'proper' crypto the risk is quite high…but as we go forward, risks should decrease as well as potential upsides,” he added.

Despite resistance that still surrounds crypto in the travel industry, however justified, stablecoins are not designed to be held in the hope they appreciate. They are designed to move money quickly, predictably, and across borders, all powered by blockchain technology.

To minimize exposure even further, Turner explained that, for now, 360 converts incoming stablecoin payments into fiat currency on a daily basis. No assets are being held overnight, and the agency isn't betting on currency fluctuations to pad its coffers. Rather, crypto is being treated as an alternative rail for cheaper and faster cross-border transfers.

Longer term, Turner does see more widespread adoption. As more suppliers begin to accept digital currency themselves, agencies could transact end-to-end in stablecoins — converting only residual balances back into fiat when needed. But that phase depends on supplier readiness and additional infrastructure. The emphasis for 360 today is on getting the foundations right for its clients.

Generally, conversations about crypto stall around its complexity. The space has its own intricate language, and it's easy to get lost as the discussion inevitably touches on wallets, blockchains, or some other esoteric term. At its core, though, the technology is less about new money than about new financial plumbing.

Luca De Giglio, a researcher who has spent years studying digital currency adoption in the travel sector, offers a metaphor that helps distill the concept.

“Stablecoins are to payments what email was to letters,” he explained in a video interview. “Legacy payments are not internet-native. Stablecoins are. The jump in speed, efficiency, and cost reduction is significant.”

The existing payment infrastructure that underpins global travel was never designed for real-time, cross-border commerce. It relies on layers of intermediaries, cut-off times, confirmations, opaque FX rates, and reconciliation processes that remain stubbornly manual.

Those layers are not abstract — they are expensive. As LTA reported earlier this year in an investigation into commission delays and foreign exchange fees, the costs borne by the travel industry — particularly travel agencies — are significant. Once fees, charges, FX rates, time-value of delay, and time spent chasing and reconciling with intermediaries are combined, transaction costs routinely fall between eight and ten percent for agencies just to collect. In some cases, foreign exchange alone pushes that figure even higher.

By contrast, the cost of stablecoin transactions typically falls in the range of 0.5 to one percent.

“That difference is enormous,” Turner said.

For an agency doing hundreds of millions in sales annually, reducing the cost of processing by even a few percentage points has a direct impact on the bottom line. Speed matters as much as cost: Crypto also offers fewer reconciliation steps, faster settlement, transparent FX, 24/7 operation, and less time spent tracing payments or resolving discrepancies.

“In our market it would mean less cost of transaction, less time to receive commission, and a very efficient way of payment,” said Urracci. “Unfortunately, we are very far from that due to continuous change in European regulation on crypto.”

There are risks, however, especially if controls and security protocols are not in place. While the basic tools required to accept stablecoins are widely available, the guardrails are not. Fraud prevention, internal authorizations, cybersecurity, and auditability all become more critical when transactions are high value.

“We're a luxury business and there's a lot of attention on us. Fraud is inevitable when you're dealing with millions of dollars,” said Turner.

360 has relied on its own technology stack to manage those challenges — building in multiple authorization layers and tightly controlled workflows. The investment required for that approach is not as easily replicated by a small, standalone agency; though, Globe7's example suggests the boutique model isn't without precedent.

Geography and jurisdiction also play a role. While Dubai has emerged as a crypto hub, Turner is clear that 360's new UAE office was not the driver of this move.

“Dubai certainly has higher demand and a lower risk threshold, but this is a broader international shift,” he said.

That broader shift is visible in other ways. Some new developments are being designed to attract digital entrepreneurs and globally mobile capital — Zanzibar's proposed ""Cyber City"" being one example of how destinations themselves are beginning to position around digital finance, not just as a tourism story but as an economic infrastructure play. Money and people are moving differently, and the travel industry sits directly in the path of that change.

In contrast to Dubai, the UK remains more conservative from a regulatory and cultural standpoint, which makes implementation more complex, according to Turner. Yet the demand — particularly among globally mobile, HNW clients — is now strong enough to justify the effort.

For now, 360's crypto capability is available for both client payments and advisor payouts. Supplier settlements are the next logical phase, and Turner estimates that meaningful supplier engagement could begin within six months once systems are ready to operate at scale.

“If it returns more value to advisors and squeezes out unnecessary costs, that's good for the industry, for the ecosystem,” he said.

Crypto will not solve the luxury travel industry's payment problems overnight. But 360's move represents something more substantial than a pilot. An agency with more than 200 advisors across 60 countries claiming they made six figures in crypto payments within weeks of adoption would, if true, be a notable step forward in whether the industry can modernize how its money moves.

The travel industry's payment infrastructure has lagged other sectors for years. For agencies willing to engage seriously with the mechanics, stablecoins may offer a way to leapfrog some of that history — not by speculating on a new asset class, but by replacing an expensive and slow one with something faster, cheaper, and already working. 

The question now is whether suppliers and host agencies move quickly enough to meet them there.

From Paul O'Donoghue at AMLi



GOOD morning and welcome to the Thursday AML Intelligence Technology Newsletter, where we look at all the advances in the AFC tech space.  Here's your quick hit of the week's biggest stories.



AML RULES still vary wildly across the EU - something which certain crypto companies are looking to take advantage of.



Claudia Buch, Chair of the ECB (European Central Bank) Supervisory Board, warned that some crypto firms are choosing to operate in EU countries with ‘lighter' compliance controls.



She said that the ECB must work with AMLA, the EU's new AML Authority, to tackle these issues.



“The evolving crypto-asset sector is particularly vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing,” she said.



“AMLA will focus on the AML aspects of the supervision of higher-risk sectors, including CASPs (Crypto-Asset Service Providers). 



“Divergent national approaches to registration and authorisation can lead to supervisory fragmentation. And increase the risk of high-risk firms strategically choosing countries with lighter AML controls.”







NEW BOARD: AML RightSource has formed an International Advisory Board as it looks to accelerate its global rollout.



Chaired by 

        Vesna M.
      
  , the board sits within the firm's advisory structure and works alongside the North America Advisory Board.



Senior experts from the UK, Europe, APAC, and Australia make up the new board. A full list of the new board members and their backgrounds is available [HERE].



 



FUNDRAISE: Sphinx, a company that develops browser-native AI compliance agents for financial institutions, has raised $7.1 million in a seed funding round.



The firm said it will use the money to scale its “agentic compliance workforce.”





        Alexandre Berkovic
      
  , Co-Founder and CEO, said: “Compliance today is mostly human glue between systems that were never designed to work together.



“Sphinx takes on that work directly. So analysts can focus on the judgment calls. And institutions finally get a complete, defensible record of how every decision was made.”



The Summit takes place as Europe's AFC, AML, FCC and Fraud agenda is entering a defining phase.



Across the industry, leaders are grappling with the same hard questions – Crypto Regulations, AMLA expectations, MiCA execution, FATF scrutiny, fintech and BaaS risk, sanctions evasion and fraud escalations. SECURE YOUR PLACE TODAY!







BRETTON: Finally, US firm Bretton AI has raised $75 million in a Series B round led by Sapphire Ventures, as it looks to further develop its AI-powered anti-financial crime platform.



Additionally, the company has also rebranded, changing its name from Greenlite AI. The funding follows a $15 million Series A completed less than a year ago.



The new funding will support product development, regulatory engagement and expansion into additional financial crime domains, the company said.

Wallet infrastructure firm Kresus Labs has raised approximately 18 billion won ($13 million) in investment from Hanwha Investment & Securities, one of South Korea's largest financial institutions.

The investment follows a memorandum of understanding signed in December at Abu Dhabi Finance Week and is aimed at expanding Kresus' enterprise digital wallet infrastructure, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platforms and onchain financial workflows.

The wallet and blockchain infrastructure firm develops digital asset tools for both consumers and institutions, including ""seedless"" wallet recovery technology and multi-party computation (MPC)-based security systems. 

Seedless recovery refers to the means of restoring access to a digital asset stored in a wallet without having to use the traditional stream of 12-24 random words, which could prove a barrier to entry for some.

Kresus also operates wallet infrastructure and tokenization platforms designed to meet institutional compliance and operational requirements.

Hanwha plans to use Kresus' technology to enhance its client-facing digital asset services and to develop tokenized versions of traditional financial products. For established financial firms, wallet security and compliant tokenization frameworks remain key barriers to deeper engagement with blockchain-based markets.

The raise underscores how capital continues to flow into infrastructure providers even when broader crypto markets are volatile. Rather than backing speculative tokens, institutions are increasingly targeting custody, security and tokenization layers that can plug into existing financial systems.

Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone appeared to walk back his $10,000 forecast for bitcoin, instead highlighting $28,000 after being challenged on social media and accused of being an alarmist whose “nonsensical” forecasts put real capital at risk.

Earlier this week, McGlone warned that collapsing crypto prices could signal broader financial stress and that bitcoin could revert toward $10,000 if U.S. equities peak and recession follows. He framed the token as a high-beta risk asset vulnerable to a breakdown in the post-2008 “buy the dip” regime.

But in a subsequent post on X, McGlone pointed to $28,000 as a more probable level based on historical price distribution, a notable shift from his earlier base case. He also said his analysis “suggests why not to buy bitcoin or most risk assets.”

His correction upward also followed being challenged to a debate by market analyst and AdLunam co-founder, Jason Fernandes on X and LinkedIn posts.

Fernandes, whose LinkedIn challenge was liked but not accepted by McGlone, told CoinDesk his broader critique still stands, even after the Bloomberg analyst revised his target. “$28K is obviously more realistic than $10K,” Fernandes said. “Proportionately fewer things need to go wrong for $28K than $10K.”

Mati Greenspan, a market analyst and the Quantum Economics founder, said $28,000 was still unlikely, “but in markets we never want to rule anything out.”

Greenspan had also called McGlone out in a post on X following his lower forecast, saying, “Mr. @mikemcglone11 would have you believe that an asset with trillions of dollars in monthly volumes could crash to a market cap of 200 billion.” He said the forecast was “literally nonsense.""

Fernandes previously estimated a more likely reset in the $40,000 to $50,000 range absent a systemic liquidity shock. He noted that $28,000 now sits closer to his lower bound than to McGlone's original call. “It bears mentioning that he has adjusted his near-term outlook closer to my low end than his previous prediction,” Fernandes said.

At stake in the debate is more than price targets. Fernandes said that deterministic, alarmist framing can materially influence positioning and put “real capital at risk,” particularly in reflexive markets like crypto.

Eric Trump reitrates claim bitcoin is just getting started on its road to $1 million

U.S. President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump acknowledged bitcoin's volatility but said its upside potential outweighs the risks as prices hover below $70,000.

Crypto prices fell across majors on Thursday, with ether, XRP and Solana leading declines as traders struggled to extend this week's brief stabilization.

Bitcoin traded near $66,700, down about 1.7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk market data. Ether slipped a similar amount to around $1,965, while XRP fell nearly 5% and Solana dropped close to 4%. BNB and Dogecoin were also in the red, reflecting broad weakness rather than token-specific moves.

The slide came even as Asian equities pushed higher in thin holiday trading. MSCI's Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose about 0.5%, Japan's Nikkei gained roughly 0.85%, and South Korea's Kospi jumped around 3% to a record high. 

The move followed a rebound in U.S. tech stocks after Nvidia signed a multi-year deal to supply Meta Platforms with AI chips.

Crypto did not participate in that optimism. Instead, price action remains heavy. Recent bounces have been met with steady selling, with gains fading as soon as momentum stalls.

Unlike earlier in the quarter, the market is no longer unraveling on every push lower, but it is also failing to attract sustained spot demand that would shift the tone.

The dollar firmed after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting showed policymakers were in no rush to cut rates. Some officials even flagged the possibility of rate hikes if inflation remains sticky. 

A stronger dollar typically tightens global liquidity and weighs on risk assets, and crypto's pullback tracked that pattern.

Gold has been doing what gold does best, absorbing uncertainty with quiet strength even as risk assets chop around, and that contrast is sharpening the debate over whether bitcoin can still claim “digital gold” status. 

Alex Tsepaev, chief strategy officer at B2PRIME Group, said in an email to CoinDesk that he metal's resilience reflects investors reaching for the simplest hedge in a market still jittery on geopolitics, policy and the Fed.

""I believe that gold will continue to be a default haven and will probably attempt to break through the tough $5,000–$5,100 ceiling. That said, once risk appetite returns, ETF flows stabilize, and U.S. regulations stop dragging, Bitcoin may recover considerably more quickly,"" he said.

Oil prices held onto recent gains amid lingering U.S.-Iran tensions, keeping geopolitical risk in the background. Against that backdrop, crypto remains caught between periodic relief rallies and a macro environment that is not yet supportive enough to turn them into something more durable.

U.S.-listed crypto ETFs are flashing red across the board, with one notable exception.

Bitcoin spot ETFs saw $133.3 million in daily net outflows as of Feb. 18, led by BlackRock's IBIT, which shed $84.2 million, and Fidelity's FBTC, which lost $49 million. Total net assets across bitcoin funds stand at $83.6 billion, roughly 6.3% of bitcoin's market cap, but recent flows suggest institutions are trimming exposure rather than adding on dips.

Ethereum products followed a similar pattern. U.S. ETH spot ETFs recorded $41.8 million in net outflows on the day, with BlackRock's ETHA losing nearly $30 million. Total net assets across ether funds sit at $11.1 billion, about 4.8% of ETH's market cap. 

The steady bleed comes as ether trades below $2,000 and struggles to build momentum despite broader expectations of rate cuts later this year.

XRP ETFs also slipped into negative territory, posting $2.2 million in daily outflows. Total net assets across XRP funds are just over $1 billion, or roughly 1.2% of XRP's market cap. Price action in XRP has mirrored the cautious tone, with the token down over 4% on the day.

Solana, however, stood out. 

U.S. SOL spot ETFs recorded $2.4 million in net inflows, pushing cumulative inflows to nearly $880 million. Bitwise's BSOL led with $1.5 million in fresh capital. While modest in absolute terms, the inflow contrasts sharply with the broader risk-off positioning across bitcoin and ether products.

Elsewhere, smaller altcoin ETFs such as LINK saw marginal inflows, but the overall picture remains one of selective exposure rather than broad-based accumulation.

The divergence suggests investors are rotating within crypto rather than exiting entirely. With macroeconomic uncertainty lingering and the dollar firming, ETF flows offer a real-time read on where institutional conviction remains and where it is fading.

Alzheimer's blood tests predict what age people will be when the disease may cause symptoms, study finds

Tests that could reveal when Alzheimer's disease will emerge, while promising, are not ready for use in otherwise healthy people, scientists say

Blood tests that detect a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease could help predict the age at which the disease may strike people long before they develop symptoms, according to a new study. But questions remain about the accuracy and uncertainty of these tests, and experts caution that the assays aren't ready for prime time.

“While the results here are encouraging, they are not yet at the level of having significant clinical benefit for individual patients,” says Corey Bolton, a clinical neuropsychologist and an assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new study. “Alzheimer's disease is a complex condition with numerous intersecting risk and resilience factors that vary from person to person. These factors can have a large influence in the age of symptom onset and the rate of clinical decline.”

The study included more than 600 people aged 62 to 78 who were not cognitively impaired. They had blood tests to detect a protein called p-tau217, which accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. The researchers then used a model based on the tests to predict the age of onset of the disease in people with no cognitive impairment with three to four years of uncertainty.

“A key innovation was estimating when they're going to develop symptoms,” says Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who co-authored the study. The research was published on Thursday in Nature Medicine. Several of the study authors have consulted for or received funding from companies that make these Alzheimer's blood tests. Schindler says she provides unpaid consulting to diagnostic companies.

More than seven million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, and there is no cure. The neurodegenerative condition is associated with the buildup of plaques of amyloid protein and tangles of tau protein in the brain, which can develop for a decade or more before visible symptoms such as memory loss or confusion arise.

Blood tests are increasingly used to detect biological signs of the disease. They are much cheaper and easier to administer than traditional diagnostics such as spinal taps or positron-emission tomography (PET) scans. Two tests are approved for use in the U.S. in people with Alzheimer's symptoms—Lumipulse (made by Fujirebio) and Elecsys (made by Roche Diagnostics).

But these tests may not always accurately predict who will and won't develop Alzheimer's, experts say. And the medical consensus is that they should not be taken by people who do not have symptoms of cognitive decline.

Detecting Alzheimer's before symptoms show up, however, may be crucial to treating it: although there is no cure for the condition, two drugs have been approved that can slow the rate of progression in some people when the disease is caught early. And there are clinical trials of these drugs underway to determine whether treatment could head off the disease in people who have biological signs of the disease but no symptoms. The results are expected in the next few years.

In the new study, Schindler and her colleagues tested how well a blood test for p-tau217 could predict the age at which people who had the protein would develop symptoms of the disease. They found that these blood, or plasma, “clocks” could predict how likely and when people would develop symptoms of the disease. Interestingly, the older a person was, the sooner symptoms would appear.

“So, for example, if you have a positive blood test when you're 60, it may take 20 years before you develop symptoms—versus, if you don't have a positive blood test until you're 80, it may take only 10 years,” Schindler says.

Of course, the tests are not foolproof. It's important to note that the researchers are “not recommending this for people who are asymptomatic,” says Zaldy Tan, a memory and aging specialist at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. And a three- to four-year error margin on either side of diagnosis is “a big window,” he notes, especially if you're using the knowledge to make decisions about retirement plans or finances.

“Other medical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease and obesity, seem to have a large impact on the circulating levels of these proteins and can greatly influence results, leading to false positives or false negatives,” Bolton says. This study used a type of test that limits the effect of these conditions, he says, but “there are still many unanswered questions about how these blood tests perform in diverse populations.”

Despite their limits, however, the tests are still valuable for diagnosis and planning treatment, Bolton says. People found to be at greater risk of developing the disease could still benefit from interventions such as exercise, a healthy diet and cognitive or social stimulation.

Nathaniel Chin, a geriatrician and medical director at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in Madison, who was not involved in the study, is “impressed and excited” by its results. He hopes researchers will replicate the findings in other populations.

The study was funded by a public-private partnership through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium. Schindler notes that the study data are publicly available and that anyone can download and analyze them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New sodium ion battery stores twice the energy and desalinates seawater","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260218031603.htm","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:18:36 GMT","

Sodium-ion batteries are emerging as a promising option for cleaner, more sustainable energy storage. Researchers at the University of Surrey have identified a surprisingly simple way to improve their performance by keeping water inside a critical battery material instead of removing it.

Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the market, but they depend on costly materials that can harm the environment. Sodium, by contrast, is abundant and widely accessible. Even so, matching the performance of lithium-ion technology has been a major hurdle for sodium-ion systems.

Water Boosts Sodium Vanadium Oxide Performance

In research published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, scientists examined sodium vanadium oxide, a well-known sodium-based compound. They discovered that allowing the material to retain its natural water content significantly enhances how it functions inside a battery.

The compound, called nanostructured sodium vanadate hydrate (NVOH), delivered far stronger results when used in its hydrated form. It stored substantially more energy, charged at a faster rate, and maintained stability for more than 400 charge cycles.

During testing, the hydrated version held nearly twice as much charge as standard sodium-ion cathode materials. This performance places it among the top cathodes reported so far for sodium-ion batteries.

Dr. Daniel Commandeur, Research Fellow at the University of Surrey School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, and lead author of the paper, said:

""Our results were completely unexpected. Sodium vanadium oxide has been around for years, and people usually heat-treat it to remove the water because it's thought to cause problems. We decided to challenge that assumption, and the outcome was far better than we anticipated. The material showed much stronger performance and stability than expected and could even create exciting new possibilities for how these batteries are used in the future.""

Seawater Operation and Electrochemical Desalination

The team also explored how the material performed in salt water, an especially demanding environment for battery systems. Not only did it continue operating effectively, it also removed sodium ions from the saltwater solution. At the same time, a graphite electrode extracted chloride ions in a process known as electrochemical desalination.

Dr. Commandeur added:

""Being able to use sodium vanadate hydrate in salt water is a really exciting discovery, as it shows sodium-ion batteries could do more than just store energy -- they could also help remove salt from water. In the long term, that means we might be able to design systems that use seawater as a completely safe, free and abundant electrolyte, while also producing fresh water as part of the process.""

Toward Safer, Low Cost Alternatives to Lithium

This advance could speed up the adoption of sodium-ion batteries as a practical alternative to lithium-based technology. Because sodium is inexpensive and plentiful, these batteries have the potential to be safer, more affordable, and more environmentally friendly.

Possible uses include large-scale renewable energy storage for power grids as well as applications in electric vehicles. By simplifying the production of high-performance sodium-ion batteries, the Surrey team's findings move commercially viable, sustainable energy storage one step closer to reality.

Scientists at the University of New Hampshire are using artificial intelligence to speed up the search for advanced magnetic materials. Their work has produced a searchable resource containing 67,573 magnetic compounds, including 25 materials that had not previously been recognized as magnets capable of staying magnetic at high temperatures.

""By accelerating the discovery of sustainable magnetic materials, we can reduce dependence on rare earth elements, lower the cost of electric vehicles and renewable-energy systems, and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base,"" said Suman Itani, lead author and a doctoral student in physics.

A Massive Magnetic Materials Database

The new resource, called the Northeast Materials Database, makes it easier for scientists to explore materials that are essential to modern technology. Magnets are critical components in smartphones, medical devices, power generators, electric vehicles, and many other everyday systems. However, today's most powerful magnets depend on rare earth elements that are costly, largely imported, and increasingly difficult to secure. Despite the large number of known magnetic compounds, no entirely new permanent magnet has been identified from this pool.

The study, published in Nature Communications, describes how the team developed an AI system capable of reading scientific papers and pulling out important experimental data. That information was then used to train computer models to determine whether a material is magnetic and to calculate the temperature at which it loses its magnetism. The results were organized into one comprehensive and searchable database.

Reducing the Need for Rare Earth Elements

Researchers have long understood that many magnetic materials likely remain undiscovered. Yet testing every possible combination of elements, which could number in the millions, would take enormous amounts of time and money in a laboratory setting.

""We are tackling one of the most difficult challenges in materials science -- discovering sustainable alternatives to permanent magnets -- and we are optimistic that our experimental database and growing AI technologies will make this goal achievable,"" said Jiadong Zang, physics professor and co-author.

Expanding the Role of AI in Science and Education

The research team also includes co-author Yibo Zhang, a postdoctoral researcher in both physics and chemistry. Looking ahead, the scientists believe the large language model used in this project could serve purposes beyond building this database, especially in higher education. For example, the technology could convert images into modern rich text formats, helping update and preserve library collections.

The project received support from the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, U.S. Department of Energy.

Researchers at University College London have identified a biological process that helps the body shut down inflammation once it is no longer needed. The discovery could pave the way for new treatments for chronic diseases that affect millions of people around the world.

Inflammation is an essential defense mechanism that protects us from infection and injury. However, if it continues unchecked, it can contribute to serious conditions including arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. Until now, scientists did not clearly understand how the body transitions from an active immune attack to a healing phase.

Fat Derived Molecules That Calm the Immune System

The study, published in Nature Communications, found that small fat-based molecules known as epoxy-oxylipins act as natural regulators of the immune response. These molecules help prevent the buildup of specific immune cells called intermediate monocytes*, which are associated with chronic inflammation -- linked to tissue damage, illness and disease progression.

To explore this process, researchers conducted a carefully controlled experiment in healthy volunteers. Participants received a small injection of UV-killed E. coli bacteria in the forearm. This triggered a temporary inflammatory response -- pain, redness, heat and swelling -- similar to what occurs after infection or injury.

Volunteers were divided into two groups: prophylactic arm and therapeutic arm.

At different stages, participants were given a drug called GSK2256294. This medication blocks an enzyme known as soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which normally breaks down epoxy-oxylipins.

In the prophylactic arm, 24 volunteers participated -- 12 received the drug and 12 received placebo (placebo). They were treated two hours before inflammation began to test whether boosting epoxy-oxylipins early could prevent harmful immune changes.

In the therapeutic arm, another 24 volunteers -- 12 treated and 12 untreated (placebo) -- received the drug four hours after inflammation had started. This approach reflected how treatment would occur in real world settings once symptoms appear.

Boosting Protective Lipids Reduced Harmful Immune Cells

In both groups, blocking sEH increased levels of epoxy-oxylipins. Participants who received the drug experienced faster pain resolution and had significantly lower levels of intermediate monocytes in both blood and tissue -- the immune cells linked to chronic inflammation and disease. Notably, the medication did not meaningfully change visible symptoms such as redness or swelling.

Further investigation showed that one specific epoxy-oxylipin, 12,13-EpOME, works by suppressing a protein signaling pathway known as p38 MAPK, which drives monocyte transformation. Laboratory experiments and additional testing in volunteers who received a p38 blocking drug confirmed this mechanism.

First author Dr. Olivia Bracken (UCL Department of Ageing, Rheumatology and Regenerative Medicine) said: ""Our findings reveal a natural pathway that limits harmful immune cell expansion and helps calm inflammation more quickly.

""Targeting this mechanism could lead to safer treatments that restore immune balance without suppressing overall immunity.

""With chronic inflammation ranked as a major global health threat, this discovery opens a promising avenue for new therapies.""

Corresponding author Professor Derek Gilroy (UCL Division of Medicine) said: ""This is the first study to map epoxy-oxylipin activity in humans during inflammation.

""By boosting these protective fat molecules, we could design safer treatments for diseases driven by chronic inflammation.""

He added: ""This was an entirely human-based study with direct relevance to autoimmune diseases, as we used a drug already suitable for human use -- one that could be repurposed to treat flares in chronic inflammatory conditions, an area currently bereft of effective therapies.""

Scientists chose to investigate epoxy-oxylipins because previous animal research suggested they can reduce inflammation and pain. However, their role in human biology had not been clearly defined. Unlike well known inflammatory signals such as histamine and cytokines, epoxy-oxylipins belong to a lesser studied pathway that researchers believed might help naturally quiet the immune system.

Next Steps for Arthritis and Heart Disease Research

The findings open the possibility of clinical trials to test sEH inhibitors as treatments for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease.

Dr. Bracken said: ""For instance, rheumatoid arthritis is a condition in which the immune system attacks the cells that line your joints. sEH inhibitors could be trialled alongside existing medications to investigate if they can help prevent or slow down joint damage incurred by the condition.""

Dr. Caroline Aylott, Head of Research Delivery at Arthritis UK, said: ""The pain of arthritis can affect how we move, think, sleep and feel, along with our ability to spend time with loved ones. Pain is incredibly complex and is affected by many different factors. We also know that everybody's pain is different.

""That is why it is important that we invest in research like this, that helps us understand what causes and influences people's experience of pain.

""We are excited to see the results of this study which has found a natural process that could stop inflammation and pain. We hope in the future that this will lead to new pain management options for people with arthritis.""

The study was funded by Arthritis UK and included researchers from UCL, King's College London, University of Oxford, Queen Mary University of London, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, USA.

Notes

*Intermediate monocytes are white blood cells that help fight infection and repair tissue. In short bursts, they help coordinate the immune response and support recovery, but if they persist or grow in excess, they keep the immune system switched on, leading to chronic inflammation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New map reveals where lethal scorpions are most likely to strike","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260218044628.htm","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 04:37:58 GMT","

An international team of researchers has developed a method to identify and forecast hotspots for some of the most dangerous scorpion species on Earth.

By examining environmental conditions, the scientists determined which factors allow highly venomous scorpions to survive and spread -- insights that could help reveal where scorpion stings are most likely to occur in tropical regions around the world.

To reach their conclusions, the team combined field research in Africa with advanced computer modeling. This approach allowed them to estimate where high risk scorpion species are most likely to live and which environmental features shape their distribution.

Their results revealed a clear pattern -- soil type is the primary factor influencing where most scorpions are found, while temperature, including both average levels and seasonal variation, plays an important role for certain species.

Not all scorpions respond to their environment in the same way. Some species are flexible and occupy large areas. Others appear limited to very specific habitats, creating concentrated zones where the risk of stings may be especially high.

The project was led by researchers from the University of Galway in collaboration with the University Ibn Zohr in Morocco.

Published in Environmental Research Communications, the study focuses on central Morocco, one of the world's most severe scorpion sting hotspots. The findings are intended to support prevention strategies and aid the development of improved diagnostic tools and antivenoms.

Dr. Michel Dugon, Head of the Venom Systems Lab at University of Galway and senior author of the study, said: ""The findings could save lives. By pinpointing where dangerous scorpions are most likely to appear, health authorities can target awareness campaigns, train frontline medical staff, and focus community prevention in high-risk areas, especially protecting children. The approach can be applied wherever scorpions pose a threat, from Brazil to the Middle East and India.""

Scorpion Stings as a Global Health Threat

Scorpion stings are an often overlooked public health problem, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. More than 2 million people are stung every year. While many cases cause pain and swelling, some species inject venom that can trigger severe illness and even death, especially in children and older adults. Worldwide, scorpion stings are estimated to kill more than 3,000 children each year.

Although antivenoms are available for several species, doctors frequently face a major challenge. It can be difficult to determine which scorpion delivered the sting, making it harder to provide the most effective treatment quickly.

Ecological Modeling and Maximum Entropy Mapping

To address this gap, the researchers used a computer based mapping method known as Maximum Entropy. This tool helped them predict where dangerous scorpions are likely to live and which environmental conditions they favor.

By integrating globally available information on soil composition, temperature, and other habitat characteristics, the team demonstrated how high risk scorpion areas can be identified beyond Morocco. This is particularly valuable in tropical regions where detailed records of species distribution are limited.

The research involved senior scientists and doctoral researchers from both universities, with additional support from University of Galway undergraduate students who travel to Morocco each year as part of their Bachelor of Science Zoology programme.

Dr. Dugon added: ""Overall, we know very little about the ecology of scorpions, their venom and the best way to treat scorpion stings. Our international collaborative efforts aim to develop new tools for the prevention, diagnostic and treatment of scorpion stings globally. This requires multidisciplinary teams including public health specialists, clinicians, zoologists, and members of local communities.""

Fouad Salhi, doctoral researcher at the University Ibn Zohr of Agadir and first author of the study, said: ""This research shows how biodiversity data can inform public health policies. By combining long-term fieldwork with ecological modelling, we were able to identify where dangerous scorpions are most likely to occur. We aim to have real-world impact -- supporting prevention strategies, improving medical preparedness, and ultimately contribute to the reduction of the burden of scorpion stings, both in Morocco and beyond.""

Dr. Colin Lawton, Head of Zoology at University of Galway and co-author of the study, said: ""University of Galway is gaining momentum as a centre of excellence in zoological research, addressing questions of global importance, from fish stock to mammal conservation and animal-borne disease mitigation. We are very proud to integrate our BSc Zoology students into our research activities and international partnerships.""

Predicting not just if, but also when, cognitively unimpaired individuals are likely to develop onset of Alzheimerʼs disease (AD) symptoms would be useful to clinical trials and, eventually, clinical practice. Although clock models based on amyloid and tau positron emission tomography have shown promise in predicting the onset of AD symptoms, a model based on plasma biomarkers would be more accessible. Using longitudinal plasma %p-tau217 (the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated tau at position 217) from two independent cohorts (n = 258 and n = 345), clock models were used to estimate the age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity. The estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity was associated with the age at onset of AD symptoms (adjusted R2 of 0.337−0.612) with a median absolute error of 3.0−3.7 years. Notably, the time from %p-tau217 positivity to onset of AD symptoms was markedly shorter in older individuals. Similar models were constructed with data from one p-tau217/Aβ42 immunoassay and four plasma p-tau217 immunoassays. These findings suggest that the time until onset of AD symptoms can be estimated using a single blood test within a margin of error that is acceptable for use in clinical trials.

AD is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by amyloid plaques primarily comprised of amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) and neurofibrillary tangles comprising tau1. The burden of amyloid plaques as quantified by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) increases for about 10−20 years during the preclinical phase of AD when patients are cognitively unimpaired and then plateaus around the time of symptom onset2,3. By contrast, neurofibrillary tangles as measured by tau PET develop later and increase with symptom severity4,5. Although treatments for early symptomatic AD are now clinically available in some countries6,7, treating patients earlier during the preclinical phase of disease before major neurodegeneration has occurred may be more efficacious8,9. Although biomarkers can accurately identify individuals with AD brain pathology, predicting which individuals are likely to develop symptoms is more challenging, and novel predictive modeling approaches are needed.

Interestingly, once amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles start to accumulate, the burden of pathology follows a remarkably consistent trajectory across individuals2,10,11,12,13. These consistent trajectories enable the creation of clock models that relate levels of amyloid or tau PET signal to time and allow for estimation of when individuals developed amyloid or tau PET abnormality2,11,12,13,14,15. Unlike general biological aging clocks or categorical staging based on multiple biomarkers, clock models track disease progression with a specific biomarker, thereby providing granular and intuitive time-based staging1,10,13,16. Clock models allow alignment of trajectories to a reference point (for example, amyloid or tau PET positivity) that reduces heterogeneity compared to models using chronological age alone13,16. Furthermore, the age at amyloid or tau abnormality or positivity estimated by clock models can be used to estimate the age at AD symptom onset10,12,13,15,17. Knowing not just if, but also when, AD symptoms are likely to manifest would be very useful to clinical trials that aim to prevent or slow progression to symptomatic AD18.

Amyloid and tau PET are extremely useful tools in research and clinical trials but are expensive and burdensome methods with limited availability19. Recently developed blood-based biomarkers are much more accessible and less expensive20. The plasma ratio of amyloid-β peptide 42 to 40 (Aβ42/40) decreases very early during the preclinical phase of AD and then plateaus at moderate levels of amyloid plaque burden, resulting in poor correlations with AD symptoms13,16,21,22,23. However, plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at position 217 (p-tau217) and the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated tau at position 217 (referred to as %p-tau217) increase throughout the preclinical and early symptomatic phases of AD13,16,22. Importantly, plasma measures of p-tau217 and %p-tau217 have high associations not only with amyloid PET22,24,25,26,27,28 but also with tau PET24,25,29, brain volumes23 and cognition23,28. Although the concentration of plasma p-tau217 was previously demonstrated to predict risk for cognitive decline and progression to AD dementia30,31, no published studies have used plasma p-tau217 or %p-tau217 to estimate when individuals will develop onset of AD symptoms.

In the present study, we aimed to use measurements from a single plasma sample to estimate not only the probability of a cognitively unimpaired individual with positive AD biomarkers developing AD symptoms but also when they would be likely to develop symptoms. Primary analyses were performed with the C2N Diagnostics plasma %p-tau217 measure because large longitudinal datasets were available from two cohorts: the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Plasma %p-tau217 has high accuracy in classifying amyloid PET, tau PET and cognitive status; this assay is a component of C2N Diagnostics' clinically available PrecivityAD2 test and is used by some clinical trials23,25,26,27,32. Using longitudinal plasma %p-tau217 data, we created clock models that related %p-tau217 values to time and enabled estimation of the age at %p-tau217 positivity for each individual. Two approaches were used to create %p-tau217 clock models: Temporal Integration of Rate Accumulation (TIRA)10,13, which integrates the inverse of the modeled rate of change, and Sampled Iterative Local Approximation (SILA)12,17, which uses discrete rate sampling and Euler's method for numerical integration. Multiple statistical models were used to examine the relationships between the estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity and the onset of AD symptoms. Secondary analyses to assess the generalizability of this approach across plasma biomarkers were performed in the ADNI cohort with the Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42 measure that was recently cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration and with four commercially available p-tau217 assays: C2N Diagnostics, Janssen LucentAD Quanterix, ALZpath Quanterix and Fujirebio Lumipulse23.

Data from participants with longitudinal plasma %p-tau217 measurements collected at least 1 year apart were considered for potential inclusion in developing the clock models (Supplementary Table 1). When the baseline plasma %p-tau217 sample was collected, 506 individuals from the Knight ADRC cohort had a median age of 67.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 61.7–72.4 years); 54.2% were female, 35.8% were APOE ε4 carriers and 8.5% were cognitively impaired (defined by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) > 0). Knight ADRC participants had a median age of 7.1 years (IQR 5.0−11.0 years) from the first to last plasma collection. Of these participants, 310 of 506 (61.3%) provided three or more plasma samples. The ADNI cohort consisted of 406 individuals with a median age of 72.7 years (IQR 67.9–78.0 years); 49.3% were female, 34.2% were APOE ε4 carriers and 48.3% were cognitively impaired. ADNI participants had a median age of 5.0 years (IQR 4.0-6.5 years) from the first to last plasma collection. Of these participants, 404 of 406 (99.5%) provided three or more plasma samples.

The rate of change in plasma %p-tau217 as a function of the estimated %p-tau217 value at the midpoint of collected samples for each participant was modeled with generalized additive models (GAMs) separately in the two cohorts (Fig. 1a,b). As was described for similar models using amyloid and tau PET13, intervals with relatively low variance in the rate of change (that is, below the 90th percentile) were identified. These intervals were between plasma %p-tau217 values of 0.29% and 10.45% for the Knight ADRC cohort and between 1.06% and 10.59% for the ADNI cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The intersection yielded an interval of consistent change for plasma %p-tau217 of 1.06% to 10.45%.

For the Knight ADRC (a) and ADNI (b) cohorts, each gray point represents the rate of change in plasma %p-tau217 for an individual as a function of the estimated %p-tau217 value at the midpoint of follow-up. Black solid lines represent GAMs fitting the individual data points, showing the predicted mean rate of change. Gray shading indicates 95% confidence intervals around the fitted GAM curves. Red dashed vertical lines represent the estimated %p-tau217 value at which variance in the rate of change was greater than the 90th percentile of variance in rates of change for the cohort, which identified a range of 1.06−10.45% over which %p-tau217 had relatively consistent change. Clock models relating time to %p-tau217 are shown for the Knight ADRC (c) and ADNI (d) cohorts and were created using two approaches: TIRA (green) and SILA (orange). The vertical black dashed line represents the plasma %p-tau217 threshold of 4.06%, which aligns with an amyloid PET Centiloid value of 20. The horizontal black dashed line represents the estimated time that an individual has a %p-tau217 value of 4.06%.

For the development of clock models, the cohort was restricted to individuals with longitudinal data within the interval of consistent change (Extended Data Table 1). The Knight ADRC clock cohort included 258 individuals with a median interval between first and last plasma %p-tau217 values of 6.5 years (IQR 3.9−9.8 years). The ADNI clock cohort included 345 individuals with a median interval between first and last plasma %p-tau217 values of 4.5 years (IQR 4.0−6.3 years). Plasma %p-tau217 positivity was defined as more than 4.06% to align with an amyloid PET Centiloid value of 20 (ref. 23). Two methods that have previously been used to create clock models with longitudinal amyloid and tau PET data were used to estimate the years from plasma %p-tau217 positivity: TIRA10,13 and SILA12,17. The clock models relating time to plasma %p-tau217 levels are shown for the Knight ADRC (Fig. 1c) and ADNI (Fig. 1d) cohorts; numerical values are provided in Extended Data Table 2 and can also be accessed via a web-based application: https://amyloid.shinyapps.io/plasma_ptau217_time/#.

Similar clock models were constructed using all longitudinal data (Supplementary Fig. 1). At very low %p-tau217 values (<1.06%), there were highly unstable TIRA time estimates in the ADNI cohort. Longitudinal data from individuals with high %p-tau217 values were sparse (Fig. 1a,b), providing less certain clock estimates for higher values. Furthermore, there were rapid increases in %p-tau217 at high values (>10.45%) that could make time estimates unstable. These features provided further rationale to use clocks constructed with the restricted range of %p-tau217 values (1.06−10.45%).

Plasma %p-tau217 trajectories as a function of age are shown for individuals included in the clock models (Fig. 2a,d) and demonstrate considerable heterogeneity, reflecting that AD pathology begins at widely varying ages. The plasma %p-tau217 trajectories were then re-plotted by years from estimated %p-tau217 positivity (age at plasma collection minus the individual's estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity) for each cohort and clock model (Fig. 2b,c,e,f). The trajectories then demonstrated increased alignment, suggesting relatively consistent patterns of change in plasma %p-tau217 across individuals (Supplementary Video 1).

Longitudinal plasma %p-tau217 data from the Knight ADRC (a−c) and ADNI (d−f) cohorts are shown as a function of age (a,d) or estimated years from %p-tau217 positivity by TIRA (b,e) or SILA (c,f) clock models. Thick black lines represent the clock models shown in Fig. 1c,d; red lines represent individuals with at least one plasma %p-tau217 > 4.06%; and gray lines represent individuals with no plasma %p-tau217 > 4.06%. Horizontal black dashed lines represent the plasma %p-tau217 threshold of 4.06%. Vertical black dashed lines represent the estimated time that an individual had a %p-tau217 value of 4.06%.

To assess model performance, the estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity based on the clock models was compared to the age at observed %p-tau217 conversion, which was the average of the age at last negative and first positive %p-tau217 values. For TIRA models, the adjusted R2 was 0.733 in the Knight ADRC cohort and 0.815 in the ADNI cohort; for SILA models, the adjusted R2 was 0.506 in the Knight ADRC cohort and 0.801 in the ADNI cohort (Extended Data Fig. 2). Additionally, we performed cross-cohort comparison of the models and found that the estimated ages at plasma %p-tau217 positivity based on TIRA models implemented on either the Knight ADRC or ADNI cohorts were highly correlated (adjusted R2 of 0.978), and ages based on SILA models from the two cohorts were almost perfectly aligned (adjusted R2 of 0.999) (Supplementary Fig. 2). The estimated ages at plasma %p-tau217 positivity based on the TIRA or SILA models were also highly correlated in the Knight ADRC cohort (adjusted R2 of 0.942) but were less correlated in the ADNI cohort (adjusted R2 of 0.863) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall, the clock models estimated similar ages at plasma %p-tau217 positivity regardless of the method or cohort and were consistent with observed conversion ages from %p-tau217 negative to positive.

Cox proportional hazards models were used in the longitudinally assessed Knight ADRC cohort to estimate the probability of initially cognitively unimpaired individuals developing symptomatic AD as a function of age (Fig. 3a). Symptomatic AD was defined to align with the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic AD: cognitive impairment (CDR > 0) with an AD syndrome (clinical features consistent with cognitive impairment caused by AD, including amnestic, logopenic aphasia, posterior cortical dysfunction or dysexecutive presentations1,33,34,35) in the context of biomarkers, indicating the presence of AD pathology1,35. The onset of AD symptoms was defined as the first clinical assessment when initially cognitively unimpaired (CDR = 0) individuals with positive AD biomarkers (based on estimated %p-tau217) were found to be cognitively impaired (CDR > 0) with an AD syndrome. Furthermore, AD symptom onset was applied only to individuals who were cognitively impaired (CDR > 0) with an AD syndrome at their last assessment—that is, if an individual had transient cognitive impairment but returned to cognitively unimpaired or had a non-AD diagnosis at their last assessment, the earlier impairment was not considered to be the onset of AD symptoms. To account for variable time between clinical assessments, the time of AD symptom onset was interval-censored between the last cognitively unimpaired assessment and the first symptomatic AD assessment.

For individuals in the Knight ADRC cohort who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline, a Cox model evaluated the probability of remaining cognitively unimpaired from AD as a function of age, stratified by the age at %p-tau217 positivity based on TIRA (a). The estimated time from %p-tau217 positivity until 50% of individuals would be expected to have symptomatic AD is shown as a function of estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity (b).

Notably, the age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity dramatically affected the time until AD symptom onset. For example, with TIRA-based estimates, participants who became plasma %p-tau217 positive at age 60 had a median time until symptom onset of 20.5 years, whereas participants who became positive at age 80 had a median time until symptom onset of only 11.4 years (Fig. 3b). Cox models for both the Knight ADRC and ADNI cohorts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The probability of symptomatic AD associated with a specific plasma %p-tau217 value and age can be accessed via a web-based application: https://amyloid.shinyapps.io/plasma_ptau217_time/.

The discriminative ability of Cox models to rank individuals by their risk of developing symptoms was assessed with a concordance index (C-index), where 0.5 is random prediction, >0.7 is very good prediction, >0.8 is excellent prediction and 1.0 is perfect prediction. For the Knight ADRC cohort, the TIRA-based model yielded a bootstrapped C-index of 0.784 (95% confidence interval: 0.720−0.843), and the SILA-based model had a C-index of 0.790 (95% confidence interval: 0.728−0.847). For the ADNI cohort, the TIRA-based model yielded a C-index of 0.730 (95% confidence interval: 0.622−0.834), and the SILA-based model had a C-index of 0.750 (95% confidence interval: 0.636−0.853). Additional analyses incorporating left-censored participants for those with cognitive impairment at study enrollment confirmed these associations with better discrimination and addressed potential survivor bias (Supplementary Fig. 5). Knight ADRC models achieved bootstrapped C-indexes of 0.821 (95% confidence interval: 0.783−0.857) for TIRA-based models and 0.828 (95% confidence interval: 0.791−0.862) for SILA-based models, whereas ADNI models yielded C-indexes of 0.672 (95% confidence interval: 0.614−0.727) for TIRA-based models and 0.707 (95% confidence interval: 0.651−0.759) for SILA-based models.

Next, the estimated age of plasma %p-tau217 positivity was used to model the age at onset of AD symptoms.

For the Knight ADRC cohort, models included 59 individuals using TIRA and 61 individuals using SILA clock models; for the ADNI cohort, models included 20 individuals using TIRA and 22 individuals using SILA (see Supplementary Table 2 for cohort characteristics). The age at onset of AD symptoms was moderately associated with the estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity for both TIRA-based (Knight ADRC adjusted R2 of 0.599; ADNI adjusted R2 of 0.337) and SILA-based (Knight ADRC adjusted R2 of 0.612; ADNI adjusted R2 of 0.470) estimates (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3). Comprehensive model diagnostics confirmed the appropriateness of linear modeling across all cohort−method combinations (Supplementary Table 4). Sensitivity analyses removing outliers demonstrated continued significance of the linear models. The estimated age at AD symptom onset associated with a specific plasma %p-tau217 value and age can be accessed via a web-based application: https://amyloid.shinyapps.io/plasma_ptau217_time/#. Consistent with findings from the Cox models, these models demonstrated that older individuals had a much shorter interval from plasma %p-tau217 positivity to symptom onset (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Individuals were included who were initially cognitively unimpaired but had a typical AD syndrome at their last assessment and developed symptoms after estimated plasma %p-tau217 positivity. Age at %p-tau217 positivity was estimated using TIRA (a) or SILA (b) models in the Knight ADRC (green points) or ADNI (black points) cohorts. Each point represents an individual participant. Linear regression lines represent the predicted mean age at symptom onset for each dataset, with shaded bands indicating 95% confidence intervals around the regression lines (green shading for Knight ADRC data and gray shading for ADNI data). Linear regression equations, adjusted R2 values, Spearmanʼs correlation coefficients (ρ) and sample sizes (N) are shown for each cohort.

The effects of APOE ε4 carrier status, sex and years of education were also examined, but these variables were either not significant or had minimal effects and, thus, were not included in the models (Supplementary Table 5). Associations between estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity and age at symptom onset were lower when individuals who developed cognitive impairment before %p-tau217 positivity were included, likely because these individuals had non-AD causes of cognitive impairment (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The error in models predicting the age at AD symptom onset based on the estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity was examined (Extended Data Table 3). Within the same cohort, models predicting the age at AD symptom onset had a median absolute error (MdAE) that ranged from 3.0 years to 3.5 years and non-parametric concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) ranging from 0.771 to 0.839 (CCC > 0.6 is considered good and CCC > 0.8 is considered excellent). For models created in the Knight ADRC cohort and applied to plasma %p-tau217 values in the ADNI cohort, there were moderate associations (adjusted R2 of 0.467 for TIRA and 0.463 for SILA) with an MdAE of 3.0−3.2 years and a CCC of 0.801−0.805. Conversely, for models created in the ADNI cohort and applied to plasma %p-tau217 values in the Knight ADRC cohort, there were also moderate associations (adjusted R2 of 0.509 for TIRA and 0.577 for SILA) with an MdAE of 3.6−3.7 years and a CCC of 0.808−0.820.

The relationship between predicted AD symptom onset and longitudinal clinical diagnoses was examined. For initially cognitively unimpaired individuals in the Knight ADRC cohort with an estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity by the TIRA-based model (Supplementary Table 6), individuals who became %p-tau217 positive at age 60 were estimated to develop symptomatic AD after 14.0 years, whereas individuals who became %p-tau217 positive at age 80 were estimated to develop symptomatic AD after only 6.2 years (Figs. 4 and 5 Supplementary Table 7). Similar analyses were performed for individuals with an estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity by TIRA or SILA in both the Knight ADRC and ADNI cohorts, including only those who were initially cognitively unimpaired (Supplementary Fig. 8) and all individuals regardless of initial cognitive status (Supplementary Tables 7–9 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Regardless of the clock model used to estimate the age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity, there was a markedly shorter time until symptom onset for individuals who developed %p-tau217 positivity at older ages in both the Knight ADRC and ADNI cohorts.

For initially cognitively unimpaired individuals in the Knight ADRC cohort, the age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity was estimated using the TIRA clock model. Each row represents the longitudinal clinical diagnoses for one individual by estimated years from %p-tau217 positivity (x axis). Individuals are sorted vertically by estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity (y axis). The point color denotes the clinical diagnosis: blue represents cognitively unimpaired at the assessment; red (AD syndrome/biomarker positive) represents cognitively impaired at the assessment and a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment with symptoms starting after %p-tau217 positivity; purple (AD syndrome/biomarker negative) represents cognitively impaired at the assessment and a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment with symptoms starting before %p-tau217 positivity; and orange (non-AD syndrome) represents cognitively impaired and a non-AD diagnosis at their last assessment. The vertical dashed line at 0 represents the estimated time of %p-tau217 positivity. The brown line represents the estimated relationship between %p-tau217 positivity age and estimated symptom onset based on the Knight ADRC model in Fig. 4a.

Progression of initially cognitively unimpaired Knight ADRC participants with a positive plasma %p-tau217 value to cognitive impairment, with either an AD or a non-AD syndrome, demonstrated wide variation in the time until symptom onset (Fig. 6a). Progression of individuals to cognitive impairment as a function of years from estimated plasma %p-tau217 positivity (Fig. 6b) or estimated years from symptom onset (Fig. 6c) is shown for TIRA-based models. Consistent with the other models, binning individuals by estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity demonstrates that older individuals develop symptoms sooner after %p-tau217 positivity (Fig. 6d,e). However, models estimating symptom onset based on age at plasma %p-tau217 adjust for this age effect (Fig. 6f). Similar analyses are shown for SILA-based models in the Knight ADRC dataset (Supplementary Fig. 9) and for TIRA-based and SILA-based models in the ADNI dataset (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

For initially cognitively unimpaired individuals in the Knight ADRC cohort, the age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity was estimated using the TIRA clock model. Three groups were examined: red (AD syndrome/biomarker positive) had a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment with symptoms starting after %p-tau217 positivity; purple (AD syndrome/biomarker negative) had a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment with symptoms starting before %p-tau217 positivity; and orange (non-AD syndrome) had a non-AD diagnosis at their last assessment. Kaplan−Meier curves show the probability for each group of remaining cognitively unimpaired individuals as a function of time from first positive %p-tau217 collection (a,d), estimated years from %p-tau217 positivity (b,e) or estimated years from symptom onset (c,f). Density plots and points beneath Kaplan−Meier curves (a−c) represent the onset of symptoms for individuals in each group. For the red group (AD syndrome/biomarker positive), Kaplan−Meier curves are shown for individuals binned by estimated age of %p-tau217 positivity (blue, <70 years; cyan, 70−80 years; green, ≥80 years) (d−f).

The alignment of the 2024 Alzheimer's Association biological stages with plasma %p-tau217, years since estimated plasma %p-tau217 positivity and estimated years from symptom onset based on plasma %p-tau217 were examined. Individuals with amyloid PET, tau PET and an estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 were classified according to the biological staging framework: stage A (normal biomarkers), stage B (AD pathologic change), stage C (AD) and stage D (advanced AD). As expected, all three plasma %p-tau217-derived measures increased with advancing biological stage (stage A, stage B, stage C and stage D), demonstrating that %p-tau217 captures the co-evolution of amyloid and tau pathologies across the AD continuum. Estimated years since symptom onset did not as clearly separate the biological stages (Extended Data Fig. 4); it is possible that biological stages may have different relationships with symptoms across age groups.

To assess whether clock models could be generated using other measures of plasma p-tau217, the same approach was implemented in the ADNI cohort with the Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42 measure and with four commercially available p-tau217 assays. First, variance analysis was used to find a range of values where the measure had a relatively consistent rate of change: Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42, 0.00−0.02; Janssen LucentAD Quanterix p-tau217, 0.01−0.16 pg ml−1; ALZpath Quanterix p-tau217, 0.10−1.11 pg ml−1; C2N Diagnostics PrecivityAD2 p-tau217, 0.72−7.99 pg ml−1; and Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217, 0.02−0.51 pg ml−1 (Extended Data Fig. 1b−e). Previously published positivity thresholds that align with amyloid PET Centiloid 20 were used for the p-tau217 measures23; using the same methodology, the threshold for Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42 was 0.00631. Next, TIRA and SILA were implemented to create clock models that related time from plasma positivity. Plasma trajectories by age or estimated years from positivity are shown for each plasma measure (Extended Data Figs. 5−7 and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). Dynamic visualizations of trajectory alignment for each assay are provided in Supplementary Videos 2−6.

The associations between age at symptom onset and age at plasma positivity were examined: Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42, TIRA adjusted R2 of 0.276 and SILA adjusted R2 of 0.584 (Extended Data Fig. 5); Janssen LucentAD Quanterix p-tau217, TIRA adjusted R2 of 0.041 and SILA adjusted R2 of 0.211 (Extended Data Fig. 6); ALZpath Quanterix p-tau217, TIRA adjusted R2 of 0.082 and SILA adjusted R2 of 0.258 (Extended Data Fig. 7); C2N Diagnostics p-tau217, TIRA adjusted R2 of 0.084 and SILA adjusted R2 of 0.301 (Supplementary Fig. 12); and Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217, TIRA adjusted R2 of 0.239 and SILA adjusted R2 of 0.450 (Supplementary Fig. 13).

In this study, we demonstrated that clock modeling methods can be used to estimate the age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity and align %p-tau217 trajectories, revealing a relatively consistent change across individuals in %p-tau217 during the preclinical and early symptomatic phase of AD. Furthermore, the estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity was associated with the age at AD symptom onset, enabling prediction of the age at AD symptom onset with a single %p-tau217 value. We found similar results with plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 and p-tau217 measured by immunoassays, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach across different blood biomarker tests.

The estimated years until AD symptom onset based on plasma %p-tau217 had an MdAE of 3−4 years, which would limit its utility for individual decision-making, but it could still be useful for group-level studies. Clock models could improve selection of participants for clinical trials who are more likely to develop symptoms within the trial period, increasing statistical power and reducing the time needed to demonstrate treatment efficacy. The variance in age at AD symptom onset explained by estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity ranges from 0.337 to 0.599, which is similar to that explained by parental age at onset for autosomal dominant Alzheimerʼs disease (ADAD) (R2 = 0.384 (ref. 36)). The relatively predictable age at symptom onset has been a major advantage of performing clinical trials in ADAD cohorts3,37.

It is possible that clock models incorporating plasma %p-tau217 or p-tau217 with other biomarkers, such as eMTBR-tau243 (ref. 38) or biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease39, may enable greater precision in estimating time until AD symptom onset. Future investigations could also explore continuous cognitive measures that identify subtle cognitive changes that occur before the threshold for clinical diagnosis. More precise models may decrease the error in the estimated years until AD symptom onset to a level that it becomes relevant for individual decision-making, which could have considerable clinical and ethical implications40. AD biomarker testing of cognitively unimpaired individuals is currently not recommended outside of research studies or clinical trials due to uncertain benefits and potential risks19,41,42,43, and we discourage individuals from using these models to determine their personal estimated age at AD symptom onset.

Notably, we found that older individuals have a markedly shorter time until AD symptom onset after developing plasma %p-tau217 positivity. This is consistent with our previous work predicting symptom onset with amyloid PET10, where we found that older individuals developed symptoms at a lower amyloid PET burden. Age-related brain changes, including age-related increases in the prevalence of co-pathologies that affect the relationships between clinical symptoms and AD pathology44, may underlie this effect. As age increases, co-pathologies become more common and may further complicate the interpretation of %p-tau217 levels in older individuals. This finding has major implications for clinical trials: individuals with the same plasma %p-tau217 values likely have very different risks of developing cognitive impairment over a 3−5-year period depending on their age. Although statistical models typically include age as a covariate, the relationship between plasma %p-tau217 levels and symptom onset is complex and may not be well captured by linear or nonlinear models, although age-stratified analyses may be helpful. Nonlinear mixed-effects models characterize population-level trajectories with individual random effects, but clock models explicitly convert biomarker levels into individualized estimates that are intuitive (for example, years since biomarker positivity) and may reveal important findings such as the marked effect of age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity on the age at AD symptom onset.

Although our clock models use the single biomarker %p-tau217, its strong associations with amyloid and tau PET effectively integrate the pathological processes of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles into the models. Notably, %p-tau217 dynamics likely capture the intertwined progression of both amyloid and tau pathology. Furthermore, the shorter interval from %p-tau217 positivity to symptom onset observed in older individuals may, in part, reflect the influence of age-related co-pathologies, such as cerebrovascular disease and other neurodegenerative diseases44. Recognizing the impact of these additional pathologies is crucial, as they may modify clinical trajectories beyond the core AD pathology. Future work incorporating complementary biomarkers of amyloid, tau and other pathologies will be important for improving the accuracy and applicability of these models.

The %p-tau217 clock models were created by implementing two different mathematical approaches in the single-site Knight ADRC cohort and the multicenter ADNI cohort. Knight ADRC participants were younger, had a much lower rate of cognitive impairment at baseline and were more likely to be APOE ε4 carriers. Despite these differences, the TIRA and SILA models generally were aligned, and neither was clearly superior, indicating the robustness of the clock concept for modeling years until AD symptom onset. Still, there were some differences, such as TIRA estimating longer periods compared to SILA, particularly in the ADNI cohort. These findings suggest that it may be helpful to implement multiple approaches when developing clocks and to rigorously evaluate the model fit. We have shared code for the TIRA method (the code for the SILA method is already publicly available from the Betthauser laboratory at the University of Wisconsin), which will facilitate testing of these modeling approaches in additional cohorts and using other measures. We encourage interested investigators to further refine these and other approaches to improve prediction of AD symptom onset. We also recommend that clinical trialists use this code and data to create models tailored to their specific goals—for example, determining p-tau217 values for specific age groups that identify individuals at high risk of developing AD symptom onset within 3 years.

Despite these promising findings, our approach has limitations. The clock models can only be used for values over which there is a consistent change in %p-tau217 (values between 1.06% and 10.45%). Values outside this range, such as a %p-tau217 of 12%, cannot be used to estimate years until AD symptom onset, although individuals with very high %p-tau217 values are likely at very high risk for developing symptomatic AD. Similarly, very low %p-tau217 values suggest a low likelihood of developing symptomatic AD for many years, but precise estimates of years until AD symptom onset cannot be made. Our analysis focused on participants with plasma %p-tau217 values within the interval of consistent change, which increases model reliability but may limit generalizability to individuals with values outside this range. Symptomatic AD was defined as cognitive impairment with an AD syndrome in the context of an estimated positive %p-tau217 value. The threshold for %p-tau217 positivity corresponds to an amyloid PET Centiloid value of 20, below which very few individuals have symptoms due to AD23,45, making it unlikely that individuals with an estimated negative %p-tau217 value have cognitive impairment due to AD pathology. However, occasional individuals may have discrepant %p-tau217 values. Notably, results were also shown for individuals with an AD syndrome with an estimated negative %p-tau217 value and those with non-AD dementia syndromes. Interpretation of estimates for smaller subgroups or those with mixed clinical presentations may be affected by limited sample sizes and co-pathologies.

Additional limitations include that participants in the study had a variety of clinical diagnoses that were grouped together for analyses, and the models do not reflect the full complexity of clinical symptoms. Participants in the study largely identified as non-Hispanic White, which may limit the generalizability of these models to other groups, especially groups with different rates of non-AD co-pathologies. Furthermore, like other longitudinal aging studies, our analysis did not explicitly model participant dropout or death, which could introduce survival bias if individuals who develop more rapid cognitive decline are more likely to discontinue participation. This potential for survival bias is an important consideration when interpreting our results, as it may lead to underestimation of decline among the most vulnerable individuals.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a single plasma %p-tau217 value can be used to estimate years from onset of AD symptoms with an MdAE of 3−4 years. Models with this level of precision may assist in selecting participants for clinical trials targeting certain phases of preclinical AD. Further refinement of these models could potentially improve predictions, enabling shorter clinical trials and possible relevance for individual decision-making.

The STROBE requirements for an observational study were followed. Research participants were included who had been enrolled in previously described studies of memory and aging at the Knight ADRC16 or the ADNI13. Both cohorts consisted of community-dwelling older adults, including participants with and without cognitive impairment, who were followed longitudinally with standardized clinical and biomarker assessments. Sex was self-reported by participants in both cohorts. The Knight ADRC cohort is focused on longitudinal characterization of preclinical AD and the transition to symptomatic AD. ADNI was initiated in 2003 and represents a collaborative effort between public and private sectors, with Michael W. Weiner serving as the principal investigator (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/). The primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial imaging scans, other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of early AD.

All protocols were approved by the Washington University in St. Louis institutional review board (Human Research Protection Office) and by the local institutional review boards at each participating ADNI site. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant or, when appropriate, from a legally authorized representative.

Plasma was collected as previously described in the Knight ADRC16 and ADNI46,47 cohorts. Plasma %p-tau217 was measured by C2N Diagnostics with a liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC−MS)-based assay32. The plasma %p-tau217 measure was calculated as p-tau217 concentration divided by non-phosphorylated tau217 concentration times 100 and is also described as the percent phosphorylation occupancy27. The Fujirebio Lumipulse G assay for p-tau217 and Aβ42 was run in singlicate with research-use-only commercially available kits on a Fujirebio Lumipulse G1200 analyzer at the Indiana University National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Biomarker Assay Laboratory (NCRAD-BAL)23. The Janssen LucentAD Quanterix and ALZpath Quanterix p-tau217 assays were run in duplicate on a Quanterix Simoa-HD-X analyzer at the Quanterix Accelerator Laboratory. Additional details are included in the study methodology report, available in the ADNI database (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

Participants underwent clinical assessments that included a detailed interview with a collateral source, a neurological examination of the participant and the CDR48. Individuals with CDR = 0 were categorized as ‘cognitively unimpaired'. Individuals with CDR > 0 were categorized as ‘cognitively impaired'; this group includes individuals with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Individuals with clinical features consistent with cognitive impairment caused by AD (for example, most commonly, insidious onset, slowly progressive decline and early amnestic impairment but also including logopenic aphasia, posterior cortical dysfunction or dysexecutive presentations) were considered to have an AD syndrome1,33,34,35. Individuals with a primary clinical diagnosis that did not include AD (such as Parkinson disease dementia and vascular dementia) were considered to have a non-AD syndrome. The assessment of clinical syndrome was made by experienced clinicians who were blinded to biomarker results, and determinations were based solely on clinical presentation and established diagnostic criteria and were recorded as the primary clinical diagnosis1,33,34,35.

Symptomatic AD was defined to align with the established guidelines for clinical diagnosis of symptomatic AD: cognitive impairment with an AD syndrome in the context of biomarkers, indicating the presence of AD pathology1,35. The onset of AD symptoms was defined as the first clinical assessment when initially cognitively unimpaired individuals with positive AD biomarkers (based on estimated %p-tau217) were found to be cognitively impaired with an AD syndrome. Furthermore, AD symptom onset was applied only to individuals who were cognitively impaired with an AD syndrome at their last assessment—that is, if an individual had transient cognitive impairment but returned to cognitively unimpaired or had a non-AD diagnosis at their last assessment, the earlier impairment was not considered to be the onset of AD symptoms.

For longitudinal visualization and analysis, participants were categorized based on their cognitive status at each assessment and final diagnostic outcome relative to estimated %p-tau217 positivity timing: (1) cognitively unimpaired at the assessment; (2) AD syndrome/biomarker positive: cognitively impaired at the assessment with a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment and symptoms starting after %p-tau217 positivity; (3) AD syndrome/biomarker negative: cognitively impaired at the assessment with a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment but symptoms starting before %p-tau217 positivity; and (4) non-AD syndrome: cognitively impaired with a non-AD diagnosis at their last assessment.

Amyloid and tau PET imaging was conducted as previously described23. A mesial-temporal meta-region of interest (ROI) that included the entorhinal, parahippocampal and amygdala regions was used to assess early tau pathology (Tearly) with a corresponding positivity threshold of 1.328 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) derived from Gaussian mixture modeling using the mean plus 2 s.d. of the first component23. A temporo-parietal meta-ROI that included the superior temporal, cuneus, inferior-superior parietal, inferior-middle-superior temporal, isthmus cingulate, lateral occipital, lingual, posterior cingulate, precuneus and superior marginal was used to assess late tau pathology (Tlate) with a corresponding positivity threshold of 1.224 SUVR, using a similar approach for identifying the threshold.

For analysis of variance in the rate of change in plasma %p-tau217, participants were included who had two or more %p-tau217 values at least 1 year apart. For development of clock models, the cohort was restricted to individuals who had two or more plasma %p-tau217 values between 1.06% and 10.45% at least 1 year apart. For models of age at AD symptom onset, individuals were included who were (1) initially cognitively unimpaired (CDR = 0), (2) subsequently developed cognitive impairment (CDR > 0) with an AD syndrome after estimated plasma %p-tau217 positivity and (3) were cognitively impaired (CDR > 0) with an AD syndrome at their last assessment. For visualization of predicted AD symptom onset as a function of estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity, all individuals or individuals who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline were included.

Clock models refer to mathematical transformations that convert biomarker levels (for example, plasma %p-tau217) into disease time (estimated years since biomarker positivity), enabling temporal staging of AD pathology progression. This approach first identifies periods of consistent biomarker change and then aligns data relative to time since estimated biomarker positivity rather than chronological age, which complements traditional longitudinal modeling methods. This terminology should be distinguished from general biological aging clocks. Our clock models are developed using the single biomarker %p-tau217, which reflects pathological processes of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles23. Although these pathologies typically evolve jointly during the progression of AD, our approach does not explicitly model their joint evolution. Instead, by leveraging the strong associations of %p-tau217 with both amyloid and tau PET, our models may capture an integrated measure of disease progression.

The rate of change in plasma %p-tau217 as a function of the estimated %p-tau217 value at the midpoint was modeled with GAMs as previously described13. To determine the range of plasma %p-tau217 values over which rates of change were consistent, we quantified prediction uncertainty using squared standard errors from GAMs, which represent the variance of model-estimated rates. As was previously described for models using amyloid and tau PET13, intervals with variance in rates of change below the 90th percentile were identified. Plasma %p-tau217 values within the interval of consistent change were used for developing clock models.

The TIRA approach estimates individual plasma %p-tau217 rates of change using linear mixed-effects modeling with random slopes and intercepts10,16. The rates of change are used in GAMs with cubic splines to characterize nonlinear relationships between the rates of change and plasma %p-tau217 levels at the estimated midpoint of follow-up. The inverse of the modeled rate of change is integrated to derive the time between plasma %p-tau217 values.

The SILA algorithm models longitudinal biomarker trajectories through discrete rate sampling and numerical integration17. The method estimates the first-order relationship between biomarker accumulation rate and biomarker levels by sampling rates across evenly distributed values and then applies Euler's method to numerically integrate this relationship into a non-parametric biomarker versus time curve.

Both clocks were centered so that time zero was a plasma %p-tau217 value of 4.06%, which aligns with an amyloid PET Centiloid value of 20 (ref. 23). To obtain an estimated age of plasma %p-tau217 positivity, participants with at least one %p-tau217 value between 1.06% and 10.45% were included. The plasma %p-tau217 clocks were used to calculate an individual's estimated age of %p-tau217 positivity by subtracting the %p-tau217 time from the age at the plasma collection. For example, if an 80-year-old person had a plasma %p-tau217 value of 7.06%, which corresponds to 8.8 years from %p-tau217 positivity (based on the Knight ADRC TIRA clock), their estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity would be 71.2 years (80 years minus 8.8 years). For individuals with more than one plasma %p-tau217 value, their estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity was an average of estimates from all plasma samples.

Scatter plots were generated with data points being color coded by cohort for visualization, to assess the concordance of estimated ages of plasma %p-tau217 positivity between different clock models (TIRA and SILA) and across cohorts (Knight ADRC and ADNI). Associations were evaluated using metrics of adjusted R2, Spearmanʼs r and CCC.

The onset of AD symptoms was defined as the first clinical assessment when initially cognitively unimpaired (CDR = 0) individuals with positive AD biomarkers (based on %p-tau217) were found to be cognitively impaired (CDR > 0) with an AD clinical syndrome. For participants who were cognitively normal at baseline, we used interval-censored and right-censored Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the association between estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity and time to cognitive impairment, accounting for the uncertainty in exact onset timing inherent in longitudinal studies. For participants who remained cognitively unimpaired throughout follow-up, survival times were right-censored at their last assessment age. To account for variable time between assessments, the time of AD symptom onset was interval-censored between the last cognitively unimpaired assessment and the first symptomatic AD assessment. In a sensitivity analysis, participants with cognitive impairment at baseline were included in the models and were left-censored. The models were fitted using the icenReg package in R with semi-parametric baseline hazard estimation. Bootstrap resampling (n = 5,000 samples) was performed to obtain robust standard errors and confidence intervals. Model discrimination was assessed using C-indexes calculated specifically for interval-censored data. Survival curves were generated to visualize the probability of remaining cognitively unimpaired across different estimated plasma %p-tau217 positivity age groups. Survival models treated estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity as a fixed covariate from the clock model estimation.

For individuals with AD symptom onset after plasma %p-tau217 positivity, linear models estimated AD symptom onset as a function of the estimated age of %p-tau217 positivity. Sensitivity analyses included individuals with AD symptom onset prior to plasma %p-tau217 positivity. Sex, years of education and APOE ε4 carrier status were considered as covariates in the models but not included in the final models due to not being significant predictors. Model diagnostics were conducted to ensure the appropriateness of linear modeling. Normality of residuals was assessed using Shapiro−Wilk tests; homoscedasticity was evaluated using Breusch−Pagan tests; and linearity was confirmed through Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based model comparison and F-tests comparing linear, quadratic and cubic polynomial specifications. Sensitivity analyses were performed by refitting models after excluding observations with Cook's distance > 4/n to assess model robustness to influential points.

Participant data were visualized as raster plots with estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity on the y axis and estimated years from %p-tau217 positivity on the x axis, with participants ordered by their estimated positivity age and color coded by clinical diagnosis category to illustrate the temporal relationship between estimated %p-tau217 positivity and symptom onset. The estimated age at symptom onset from the linear models was overlaid on the plots to aid visualization of how the timing of symptom onset varies as a function of estimated years since plasma %p-tau217 positivity.

To examine cognitive impairment risk across different temporal frameworks, we used Kaplan−Meier curves with different timelines. The primary analysis used time from baseline plasma %p-tau217 collection to onset of cognitive impairment. We also used estimated years from plasma %p-tau217 positivity and estimated years from predicted symptom onset, where predicted symptom onset age was calculated using the linear models described above. Kaplan−Meier curves were combined with density plots showing the distribution of observed events to visualize both survival probabilities and the timing of actual cognitive impairment for each outcome. For each timescale, we binned participants by age at estimated %p-tau217 positivity (<70 years, 70−80 years and ≥80 years) to assess age-dependent risk patterns.

Statistical comparisons were performed to evaluate differences in plasma %p-tau217 levels and estimated years from %p-tau217 positivity across the four 2024 Alzheimer's Association biological stages: stage A (normal biomarkers; equivalent to A−Tearly−Tlate−), stage B (AD pathologic change; equivalent to A+Tearly−Tlate−), stage C (AD; equivalent to A+Tearly+Tlate−) and stage D (advanced AD; equivalent to A+Tearly+Tlate+). Pairwise comparisons between all groups were conducted using non-parametric Conover−Iman tests with Benjamini−Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons.

The same methodology for developing clocks was implemented using Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42 and p-tau217, C2N Diagnostics p-tau217, Janssen LucentAD Quanterix p-tau217 and ALZpath Quanterix p-tau217. Thresholds for each were obtained from previously work23. Thresholds were 2.34 pg ml−1 for C2N Diagnostics p-tau217, 0.158 pg ml−1 for Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217, 0.0615 pg ml−1 for Janssen LucentAD Quanterix p-tau217 and 0.444 pg ml−1 for ALZpath Quanterix p-tau217.

Variance analysis was performed to identify biomarker ranges with relatively consistent rates of change (below the 90th percentile) for five plasma p-tau217 assays: C2N PrecivityAD2 %p-tau217 (A), Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217/Aβ42 (B), Fujirebio Lumipulse p-tau217 (C), ALZpath Quanterix p-tau217 (D), and Janssen LucentAD Quanterix p-tau217 (E). The rate of change in each biomarker was modeled using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and variance in the rate of change was calculated across biomarker values. Red dashed vertical lines mark the boundaries of intervals where variance in rates of change was below the 90th percentile, defining the biomarker ranges suitable for clock model development. Blue points indicate intervals with variance below the 90th percentile; red points indicate intervals with variance above the 90th percentile.

The estimated age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity based on clock models is shown as a function of the observed conversion age, which is the average of the age at last negative and first positive %p-tau217. Clock models in the Knight ADRC (A, B) and ADNI cohorts (C, D) were created with the TIRA (A, C) and SILA (B, D) approaches. Each point represents an individual participant. Blue lines represent linear regression fits, and gray shaded bands represent 95% confidence intervals for the regression line. Adjusted R² and Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) are shown for each model.

For individuals in the Knight ADRC (A, B) and ADNI (C, D) cohorts, age at plasma %p-tau217 positivity was estimated using either the TIRA (A, C) or SILA (B, D) models. Each row represents the longitudinal clinical diagnoses for one individual by estimated years from %p-tau217 positivity (x-axis). Individuals are sorted vertically by estimated age at %p-tau217 positivity (y-axis). The point color denotes the clinical diagnosis: blue was cognitively unimpaired at the assessment; red (AD syndrome/biomarker positive) was cognitively impaired at the assessment and had a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment with symptoms starting after %p-tau217 positivity; purple (AD syndrome/biomarker negative) was cognitively impaired at the assessment and had a diagnosis of symptomatic AD at their last assessment with symptoms starting before %p-tau217 positivity; orange (non-AD syndrome) was cognitively impaired and had a non-AD diagnosis at their last assessment. Vertical dashed lines at 0 represent the estimated time of %p-tau217 positivity. Brown lines indicate the relationship between %p-tau217 positivity age and estimated symptom onset based on the Knight ADRC models in Fig. 4.

Using data from ADNI, raincloud plots show plasma %p-tau217 levels (A), estimated years since %p-tau217 positivity by TIRA (B) and SILA (C), and years since estimated symptom onset by TIRA (D) and SILA (E) stratified by the 2024 Alzheimer's Association biological staging framework: Stage A (normal biomarkers), Stage B (Alzheimer's disease pathologic change), Stage C (Alzheimer's disease), and Stage D (advanced Alzheimer's disease). The n values provided for each group indicate the number of individual human participants included in that biological stage; each participant contributes one data point to the analysis. Raincloud plots display individual data points, probability distributions (violin plots), and box plots where the box represents the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile), the center line represents the median, and whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range; points beyond whiskers represent outliers. Group means with 95% confidence intervals are shown. Statistical comparisons between all biological stages were conducted using two-sided non-parametric Conover-Iman tests with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons. Significant group differences are indicated by asterisks (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Longitudinal plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 data from ADNI is shown as a function of age (A) or estimated years from p-tau217/Aβ42 positivity by TIRA (B) or SILA clock models (C). Thick black lines represent the clock models, red lines represent individuals with at least one plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 > 0.006312, and grey lines represent individuals with no plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 > 0.006312. The horizontal black dashed lines represent the plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 threshold of 0.006312. Models for age at symptom onset included individuals who were initially cognitively unimpaired but had a typical AD syndrome at their last assessment and developed symptoms after estimated plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 positivity. Age at p-tau217/Aβ42 positivity was estimated using TIRA (D) or SILA (E) models. Each point represents an individual participant. In D and E, black lines represent linear regression fits showing the predicted mean age at symptom onset, and gray shaded bands indicate 95% confidence intervals around the regression lines. Linear regression equations, adjusted R² values, Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ), and sample sizes (N) are shown.

While we have previously shown that a first pregnancy changes women's brain structure and resting-state brain activity, it is currently unknown how a woman's brain is transformed when she undergoes another pregnancy. Therefore, we performed a prospective pre-conception cohort study involving 110 women, including women who became pregnant of their second (PRG2) or first child (PRG1) and nulliparous women. Multimodal MRI data were acquired and differential changes between PRG2 and PRG1 were observed in grey matter volume, white matter tracts and functional neural network organization. Together, these results show similar but less pronounced structural and functional changes in the default mode and frontoparietal network in PRG2, suggesting a primary adaptation of these networks in first-time mothers that is further fine-tuned across a second pregnancy. Furthermore, stronger alterations were found in PRG2 in the dorsal attention and somatomotor network including the corticospinal tract, pointing to an enhanced plasticity within these externally-oriented networks. Neurostructural changes in both groups related to mother-infant attachment and peripartum depression. These findings show that a second pregnancy uniquely changes a woman's brain, entailing both convergent and distinct neural transformations.

Pregnancy represents a monumental phase in many women's lives, orchestrated by unparallelled physiological and neuroendocrine changes that influence all major bodily systems. We have previously shown that reproduction is associated with widespread changes in women's brain structure1,2, which has since been replicated in various other studies across the world3,4,5. Additionally, we have shown that pregnancy also affects functional neural network organization in the default mode network2. While research is beginning to uncover pregnancy-induced brain plasticity, all studies so far have focused solely on first-time mothers, leaving it unclear whether similar brain changes occur as a result of subsequent pregnancies.

Animal studies point to an association between subsequent reproductive experiences and neuroanatomical variations in the brain. Hippocampal dendritic morphology, neurogenesis and protein levels have been shown to differ between primiparous and multiparous female rodents6,7,8. Additionally, parity has lasting effects on synaptic plasticity and inflammation in the hippocampus and the response to ovarian hormones in middle-aged rodents9,10,11,12. While these findings provide evidence for structural variations in the rodent brain on the basis of parity, research on this topic in human mothers is still in its infancy.

Recent studies have suggested that parity may involve long-lasting neural changes in human mothers measured beyond the postpartum period. In middle-aged women, parity has been linked to brain age, with multiparous women having younger-looking brains compared to primiparous and nulliparous women13,14. Additionally, parity has been associated with cortical thickness, functional connectivity and gray matter volume in women during late life15,16,17. Parity may also modulate the risk for and effects of various brain disorders that may occur later in life, such as Alzheimer's Disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury18,19,20,21. Furthermore, links between parity and cognition have been shown22, characterized by a U-shaped effect of parity on cognition, with the highest scores on the Mini Mental State Examination in women with one to four pregnancies, compared to nulliparous women and women with grand parity23. Although these findings provide evidence for long-lasting differences in neural anatomy in relation to multiple childbirths in human mothers, it remains unclear whether a first and second pregnancy differentially affect the human brain.

Therefore, we performed a prospective pre-conception cohort study involving second-time mothers, first-time mothers and nulliparous control women to investigate whether a second pregnancy is associated with structural and functional changes in the brain. We acquired multimodal 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, involving high-resolution anatomical MRI, resting-state functional MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), before pregnancy and in the early and late postpartum period in 30 women undergoing a second pregnancy (PRG2; becoming multiparous between the scans) and in 40 women undergoing a first pregnancy (PRG1; becoming primiparous between the scans). We also included a control group of 40 nulliparous control women (CTR), who underwent MRI scanning at a similar time interval. We assessed the differential effects of a second pregnancy on brain structure, functional neural networks, white matter organization and neural metabolite concentrations. This study demonstrates that a second pregnancy changes a woman's brain and uniquely impacts its gray matter structure, neural network organization and white matter tracts.

To investigate anatomical brain changes across a first and second pregnancy compared to control women, we performed vertex-wise longitudinal analyses of cortical volume, thickness and surface area in Freesurfer. Generalized linear models (GLMs) comparing the volume change from pre-pregnancy (PRE) to the early postpartum period (POST) between multiparous and control women demonstrated widespread volumetric decreases across a second pregnancy (Fig. 1a, b). The median percentage volume decrease across these significant vertices in the left and right hemisphere was 2.8%. Similarly, women who were pregnant for the first time showed significant volumetric decreases from PRE to POST compared to control women (Fig. 1c, d). The areas of significant change covered a 79% larger part of the brain than in second-time mothers, and the median percentage of change was 3.1% within these significant vertices. Effect sizes for these volumetric decreases across a first and second pregnancy were large (Cohen's D > 1.0; Supplementary Table 1). In both groups, there were no significant increases in cortical volume across pregnancy compared to control women. Similar results were found when investigating cortical thickness (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and surface area (Supplementary Fig. 1b), showing decreases in cortical thickness and surface area across a first and second pregnancy when compared to control women.

Vertex-wise analyses showing brain areas in which the cortical volume decreased from pre-pregnancy (PRE) to early postpartum (POST) in second-time mothers (PRG2; n = 30; a) and in first-time mothers (PRG1; n = 40; c) versus control women (CTR; n = 40). Values represent −log(FDR-corrected p value), thresholded at 3 (being p = 0.001). Extracted total volumes of all the significant vertices are shown in b (PRG2-CTR) and d (PRG1-CTR), with *p < 0.001 for two-sided paired t-tests (PRG2-CTR) or two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests (PRG1-CTR) within groups. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

When directly comparing cortical volume changes across a first and second pregnancy using a permutation-based correction for multiple comparisons, we found several areas of significantly different volumetric change between PRG1 and PRG2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), although it should be noted that these effects do not surface when applying an FDR correction as in the comparisons with CTR women. Areas with a larger decrease in volume in PRG1 were mainly localized in the default mode network, whereas areas with a larger decrease in volume in PRG2 were localized in the dorsal and ventral attention network and the sensorimotor network. Effect sizes for these differences between a first and second pregnancy were smaller than the very large effect size of a pregnancy itself, but the contrast for PRG1 vs. PRG2 still showed a moderate to high effect size (Cohen's D > 0.5; Supplementary Table 1). A visual inspection of the results also shows a divergence in both the extent and localization of brain changes between these groups (Fig. 1a, c).

This divergence between brain changes across a first and second pregnancy was supported by a multivariate classification approach. We performed a multivariate pattern classification analysis in PRonTo24,25 (v3.0) on the gray matter volume difference maps resulting from the longitudinal symmetric diffeomorphic modeling pipeline implemented in SPM1226. This analysis demonstrated that, based on the gray matter volumetric changes in the brain, 80% of women could be correctly classified as becoming primiparous or multiparous in between the PRE and POST session (PRG1 vs. PRG2; p = 0.0001 after 10,000 permutations; Fig. 2a). When classifying women getting pregnant and women not getting pregnant in between these sessions, the accuracy is even higher (PRG2 vs. CTR: 87%, p = 0.0001, Fig. 2b; PRG1 vs. CTR: 94%; p = 0.0001, Fig. 2c). Using k-folds cross-validation with ten folds to reduce the risk of overfitting, classification accuracy dropped slightly, but was still significant for all three combinations of groups (PRG1 vs. PRG2: accuracy = 70%, p = 0.009; PRG2 vs. CTR: accuracy = 87%, p = 0.0001; PRG1 vs. CTR: accuracy = 91%, p = 0.0001). Adding age as a regressor to the models involving groups with age differences rendered highly similar results, both with leave-one-out cross-validation (PRG1 vs. PRG2: accuracy = 81.43%, p < 0.0001; PRG2 vs. CTR: accuracy = 84.29%, p < 0.0001) and with ten-folds cross-validation (PRG1 vs. PRG2: accuracy = 74.29%, p = 0.0008; PRG2 vs. CTR: accuracy = 82.86%, p < 0.0001.)

On the right side is the weight map for the classifier, showing the relative contribution of each voxel. Similarly, the multivariate classification between control women (n = 40) and women getting pregnant for the second time (b; balanced accuracy 87%; 10,000 permutations; p = 0.0001) and for the first time (c; balanced accuracy 94%; 10,000 permutations; p = 0.0001). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In the affected regions, brain volumes slightly increased in the late postpartum period (POST1) but had not returned to pre-pregnancy levels in both multiparous and primiparous women (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Correlation analyses between the volumetric change across pregnancy and age of the first child at the PRE session in the PRG2 group suggested that time since birth of the first child does not influence the amount of volumetric brain changes across a second pregnancy (Supplementary Fig. 4). We also tested whether there were baseline differences in cortical volumes between groups, showing no significant differences between PRG1, PRG2 and CTR women in cortical volumes at the pre-pregnancy baseline. Extracting gray matter volumes inside the area of change across a first pregnancy, suggests a partial volume reversal across the postpartum period that seems to continue after the first postpartum year (Supplementary Fig. 5).

We then assessed the relationship between the volumetric brain changes across a second or first pregnancy and maternal behavior and mental health status. When comparing PRG1 and PRG2, we did not detect any significant differences in maternal behavior and mental health status (Supplementary Table 3), although we found a trend towards more depressive feelings during pregnancy in the PRG2 group. Correlation analyses showed that maternal behavior during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period was negatively correlated with the amount of volumetric change across pregnancy, except for the postpartum bonding questionnaire (PBQ) which showed a positive correlation due to its reversed scoring where higher values represent lower maternal behavior (Supplementary Fig. 6), with stronger changes in brain structure thus being associated with higher levels of maternal behavior on the employed measures. These correlations between brain volumetric changes and maternal behavior seem to be more widespread across a first compared to a second pregnancy (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4). While the volumetric changes across a first pregnancy were associated with maternal-fetal attachment as measured with the maternal antenatal attachment score (MAAS) and prenatal attachment inventory (PAI), this was not evident in second-time mothers. Associations between volumetric changes and measures of postpartum mother-infant attachment and impairments in the mother-infant relationship as measured with the maternal postnatal attachment score (MPAS) and PBQ were observed in both PRG1 and PRG2, but these were more widespread in PRG1. Nesting behavior was similarly associated with mothers' brain changes across a first or a second pregnancy.

Regarding maternal mental health, we found associations between the observed brain changes with peripartum depression, measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS) and psychological distress measured with the K10 in both PRG groups, with less pronounced brain changes linked to more depressive complaints for most significant vertices. However, more widespread correlations were observed between volumetric change and depression and psychological distress in the PRG2 group during pregnancy, but in the PRG1 group in the early postpartum period (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 5).

To further investigate the regional distribution of changes in gray matter structure occurring across a first and second pregnancy, we assessed the differences and similarities between the changes in these groups in relation to the brain's functional networks using a cluster-wise approach (for cluster-wise results, see Supplementary Tables 6–9). Therefore, a combination of clusters resulting from the two significant contrasts (PRG2 vs. CTR and PRG1 vs. CTR) were applied on the volumetric GLM results described above. This resulted in three different areas of interest: Areas that are affected in both first and second pregnancies (overlap), areas that are only affected during a first pregnancy (only CTR-PRG1) and areas that are only affected during a second pregnancy (only CTR-PRG2) (Fig. 3a).

Combining the cluster-corrected vertex-wise analyses of the multiparous (PRG2; n = 30) vs. control women (CTR; n = 40) and primiparous (PRG1; n = 40) vs. CTR resulted in three areas of interest: areas affected in both first and second pregnancies (Overlap; yellow), areas only affected in a first pregnancy (Only CTR-PRG1, magenta) and areas only affected in a second pregnancy (Only CTRL-PRG2; green) (a). We localized these areas according to the seven resting-state networks of Yeo27 (b). After calculating the expected overlap based on a random distribution across the gray matter in the brain, we calculated the observed/expected ratio for each area for each functional network (c). The horizontal line represents an observed/expected overlap of 1, meaning that the observed intersection of the area is similar as when there would be a random distribution across the brain.

To acquire more information on the localization of these areas across the brain, we then determined their intersection with the seven resting-state networks of Yeo27 (Fig. 3b). These analyses showed that the overlapping areas in first and second pregnancies were mostly located in the default mode network (DMN), followed by the frontoparietal and ventral attention network. For these networks, the intersection between the overlapping areas and the networks was larger than expected based on a random distribution across the gray matter in the brain (Supplementary Table 10 and Fig. 3c). Interestingly, the additional areas that were specifically affected only across a first pregnancy were localized in those same networks (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 11). In comparison, the areas affected in a second pregnancy only were not localized in the default mode network but instead were mainly located in the somatomotor and dorsal attention network (Supplementary Table 12 and Fig. 3c, d).

To study functional network organization, we also analyzed resting-state functional MRI data, but we did not find significant changes in within-network coherence between a first or second pregnancy in any of the identified resting-state networks. Subsequent analyses using a default mode network (DMN) region that represents the area of significant change in functional coherence across a first pregnancy2, showed a significant group*session interaction effect between PRG1 and PRG2 in the DMN (MNI coordinates (x y z) = 12 −84 15, T = 2.85, p = 0.006 FWE-corrected; Supplementary Fig. 8), characterized by an increase in DMN network coherence only across a first pregnancy. Results for between-network connectivity are presented in the supplement (Supplementary Tables 13–15).

We also investigated the effects of a first and second pregnancy on the organization of white matter tracts in the brain, measured with diffusion-weighted MRI. Based on these diffusion-weighted images, we extracted mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD in 10−5 mm2/s) in 11 large white matter tracts across the brain (Fig. 4a) and compared PRE- and POST-pregnancy measurements between PRG2 and CTR subjects, PRG1 and CTR subjects, and between PRG2 and PRG1 subjects.

We investigated the white matter organization of eleven large white matter tracts in the brain (a). Extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD; in 10−5 mm2/s) in white matter tracts that showed significant changes from pre-pregnancy (PRE) to the early postpartum period (POST) across first (PRG1; n = 40) and/or second (PRG2; n = 30) pregnancies and control women (CTR; n = 40) (b). *p < 0.05 for two-sided paired t-tests after FDR correction for multiple testing, #p < 0.1 for two-sided paired t-tests after FDR correction for multiple testing. The CTR-PRG1 comparison in the left SLFT revealed p = 0.03, the CTR-PRG2 comparison in the right CST p = 0.03 and the PRG1-PRG2 comparison in the right CST p = 0.03, all after FDR correction.

General linear models showed significant group*session interaction effects in the MD of the right corticospinal tract (CST) between PRG2 and CTR (F(68) = 6.28, p = 0.03, η2 = 0.15, 95% CI [0.02, 0.29]) and in the FA of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (temporal part; SLFT) between PRG1 and CTR (F(78) = 7.86, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.16, 95% CI [0.03, 0.30]) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Tables 16 and 17). These effects were also visible when directly comparing subjects undergoing a first or second pregnancy, although the FA effect in the left SLFT did not survive the FDR correction for multiple testing (MD CST: F(68) = 7.44, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.18, 95% CI [0.03, 0.32]; FA SLFT: F(68) = 4.09, p = 0.09, η2 = 0.10, 95% CI [0.001, 0.23]; Supplementary Tables 16 and 17). Subsequent paired t-tests/Wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed that these effects were driven by decreases in the MD of the right CST in the PRG2 group (V = 386.5, p = 0.02, r = 0.58, 95% CI [0.28, 0.78]) and decreases in the FA of the left SLFT in the PRG1 group (t(39) = 3.74, p = 0.01, d = 0.59, 95% CI [0.26, 0.93]). We did not observe any differences in the organization of white matter tracts at the PRE session between all three groups.

To examine if these changes were maintained across the postpartum period, we also analyzed the MD in the subset of PRG2 participants of which we had complete PRE, POST and POST1 measurements (n = 14). These analyses showed that the MD in the right CST was still decreased 1 year postpartum compared to the pre-pregnancy baseline (t(13) = 4.39; p = 0.02, d = 1.17, 95% CI [0.49, 1.85]), although in this subgroup of women there was no significant difference between the pre-pregnancy baseline and the early postpartum period after correction for multiple testing (t(13) = 2.45, p = 0.18, d = 0.65, 95% CI [0.08, 1.23]).

To assess the influence of a second pregnancy on neural metabolite concentrations, we measured the concentration of five major metabolites, in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex VOI, an area showing strong volume reductions across a first pregnancy1: total NAA (tNAA: N-acetylaspartate including contributions from N-acetylaspartylglutamate), total creatine (tCr: creatine and phosphocreatine), total choline (tCho: phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylcholine), Glu (Glutamate), and Ins (myo-Inositol) (Fig. 5a). At the baseline measurement, there were no significant differences in metabolite concentration between the three groups.

Neural metabolites were measured in a voxel placed in the precuneus/posterior cingulate (a). Extracted changes in tCr, tNAA, tCho, myo-Inositol and Glutamate concentration (mM) from pre-pregnancy (PRE) to the early postpartum period (POST) across a first (PRG1; n = 39) and second (PRG2; n = 27) pregnancy and in control women (CTR; n = 37) (b). tCr total creatine (creatine and phosphocreatine), tNAA total N-acetylaspartate including contributions from N-acetylaspartylglutamate, tCho total choline (phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylcholine). Boxplots show the median and interquartile range (IQR); whiskers extend to 1.5x IQR. Individual points (jittered) are overlaid for visualization and include all values. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We compared the PRE and POST measurement between multiparous and control women, and between multiparous and primiparous women (Fig. 5b). When examining the changes in metabolite concentration between PRG2 and CTR with general linear models, we observed a group*session interaction effect for tCr only, although this effect did not survive the correction for multiple testing (F(62) = 4.24, p = 0.08, βstd = 0.31, 95% CI [0.01, 0.61]) (Fig. 5b). Subsequent one sample-tests showed that this effect was driven by significant increases in tCr across a second pregnancy (t(26) = −5.07, p < 0.0001, d = −0.98, 95% CI [−0.85, −0.36]). Results for the other metabolites can be found in Supplementary Table 18. Additionally, directly comparing PRG2 and PRG1 did not show any significant differences in metabolite concentration changes across a first and second pregnancy (Supplementary Table 19).

Although we are starting to unravel the drastic neuroplasticity associated with a first pregnancy, it is currently unknown how a woman's brain is transformed by undergoing another pregnancy. Therefore, we performed a prospective pre-conception cohort study involving 110 women and acquired multimodal imaging data, including high-resolution anatomical MRI, resting-state functional MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This allowed us to investigate the effects of a second pregnancy on gray matter volume, resting-state brain activity, white matter tract organization and neural metabolite concentrations in comparison to women undergoing a first pregnancy and nulliparous control women.

These results revealed that widespread reductions take place in cortical brain volume across a second pregnancy compared to control women, which are similar to the structural changes seen across a first pregnancy. Nevertheless, classification and cluster-wise analyses demonstrated that a second pregnancy differentially affects women's gray matter brain structure compared to a first pregnancy, identifying differences in the patterns of neural change and the degree to which different networks are affected. The observed divergence in the affected networks across a first and second pregnancy was also supported by our functional MRI data showing that functional coherence in the default mode network only increases across a first pregnancy. Furthermore, changes in white matter tract organization in different neural networks were observed across a first and second pregnancy. Together, these results demonstrate that a first and second pregnancy induce similar but also distinctive effects on a woman's brain.

The widespread cortical volume reductions we demonstrated across a second pregnancy resemble what we and other independent research groups have shown as brain plasticity across a first pregnancy1,2,3,4,5. However, a multivariate pattern recognition approach showed that women could significantly be classified as having undergone a first or a second pregnancy based solely on their brain changes between sessions. Whereas a previous cross-sectional study in mothers did not show differences in brain volume between primiparous and multiparous women in the early postpartum period28, our longitudinal approach reveals that the brain is differently affected across a first and second pregnancy. Deviations between reproduction-related neuroplasticity in primiparous and multiparous mothers have also been demonstrated in animal studies showing different cellular and molecular signatures in the early postpartum period6,7,8. Whereas multiparity has been associated with lower levels of hippocampal amyloid precursor protein (a marker of neurodegeneration)8 and enhanced spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus6, primiparity has been associated with dendritic remodeling in the CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus6 and a decrease in cell survival in the dentate gyrus7. Although our MRI-based measures of neuroplasticity cannot provide information about the underlying cellular processes across a first and second pregnancy, our data show that, similar to rodents, reproductive experience also differently influences the brain of human mothers.

Subsequent analyses examining differences in brain plasticity across a first and second pregnancy reveal both distinct and overlapping neural networks involved. The overlapping areas affected across a first and second pregnancy were mostly located in the default mode network (DMN), followed by the frontoparietal and ventral attention network. We know from previous research that these introspective and higher-order cognitive networks are strongly affected during a first pregnancy, both structurally1,2,3,5 and functionally2. Our findings suggest that these networks represent the main networks associated with pregnancy-induced brain plasticity, being it the first or a subsequent pregnancy. Interestingly, the additional areas that were specifically affected across a first pregnancy were localized in those same networks. This suggests a primary adaptation of these networks in women who become a mother for the first time, which is then further fine-tuned in a similar but more subtle way during a second pregnancy. Our resting-state functional connectivity analyses show a similar pattern. While an increase in DMN network coherence was found in the cuneus of the DMN network in a first pregnancy2, this functional change did not occur to the same degree across a second pregnancy, pointing to a primary structural and functional adaptation of this network when becoming a mother for the first time. The increase in DMN coherence opposes the effect of healthy aging on DMN connectivity, which is characterized by a decrease in within-network DMN connectivity with increasing age29 and associated with changes in cognitive functioning30. On the other hand, psychiatric disorders have shared and disorder-specific patterns of within-network DMN connectivity, characterized by increases and decreases across various diagnosis31. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the functional implications of increased DMN connectivity across a first pregnancy.

It has been well-established that the default mode network plays an important role in introspection, self-perception and social cognition32,33,34, and the cuneus—the main area where we found the differential effect of a first and second pregnancy on functional network coherence—represents a core structure subserving the neural representation of the self32. Changes in the DMN across a first pregnancy have been interpreted as shifts in a mother's self-perception and her ability to understand her children's needs and feelings. Indeed, we have previously shown that pregnancy-related brain changes in the default mode network relate to a mother's neural, physiological and emotional reactions to her infant1,2,35,36 and the degree to which she differentiates her fetus from herself during pregnancy2. Similarly, our current results show that the volumetric changes across pregnancy are related to maternal behavior. These correlations are more widespread in a first compared to a second pregnancy, suggesting that brain changes in a first pregnancy more strongly contribute to the induction of maternal behavior, whereas in a second pregnancy these changes play a smaller role as maternal behavior was already developed across the first pregnancy. Furthermore, the volumetric brain changes were also associated with peripartum depression and psychological distress in both first-time and second-time mothers, suggesting that pregnancy-induced brain changes play a role in the development of disorders of maternal mental health. Interestingly, the volumetric brain changes were more prominently associated with mental health status during a second pregnancy, but with mental health status in the postpartum period after a first pregnancy. We can speculate that his may be due to higher stress levels during a second pregnancy since the mother needs to care for another child during her pregnancy, although we did not find significant differences in stress and depression across a first and second pregnancy. More research investigating the neural substrates of maternal mental health disorders is needed to further elucidate these findings.

Similar to the DMN changes across a first pregnancy, we found a primary modulation of the frontoparietal network in first-time mothers, namely a decreasing FA in the temporal part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, also known as part of the arcuate fasciculus, compared to control participants but not compared to women undergoing a second pregnancy. Although a matter of debate, lower FA values might indicate reduced integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, as water diffusion is less directional, suggesting a less organized tract. This tract plays an important role in language processing, and enables communication of the frontoparietal regions and the temporal lobe37. Disruptions in white matter integrity have been associated with cognitive dysfunction in different disorders, such as an association between lower FA values in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and working memory deficits and speed of processing in Schizophrenia38. In accordance with the relatively pronounced cortical volume changes in first-time mothers in the frontoparietal network2,3, these results suggest that a first pregnancy more strongly transforms this higher-order cognitive neural network compared to a second pregnancy.

In comparison, the areas affected specifically across a second pregnancy were not localized in the introspection-related default mode network and the cognitive frontoparietal network but instead were mainly located in networks involved with the responsiveness to external stimuli, goal-oriented attention and task demands, such as the somatomotor and dorsal attention networks. These changes can be speculated to prepare a woman for the increased demands associated with caring for multiple children at the same time. Indeed, a previous study showed different neural responses as an index of attention to both social and non-social visual stimuli during pregnancy in primiparous compared to multiparous women39. The changes in the sensorimotor network across a second pregnancy were also supported by our diffusion-weighted MRI findings. In women undergoing a second pregnancy, mean diffusivity (MD) in the right corticospinal tract reduced across a second pregnancy, compared to control participants and women pregnant of their first child. A reduction in MD in white matter indicates that water molecules are diffusing less freely in all directions within the tissue, potentially reflecting an increase in the structural integrity. The corticospinal tract is the main white matter tract conveying motor and sensory signals from and to the sensorimotor network40. It has been suggested that a change in MD may reflect synaptic plasticity, and may be a biomarker for microstructural changes associated with learning41,42. In comparison, aging is associated with increases in MD across the white matter43, suggesting that pregnancy may oppose this aging effect. However, further research is needed to elucidate the functional implications of these changes in brain structure in second-time mothers.

When analyzing the magnetic resonance spectroscopy data measuring neural metabolite concentrations in the precuneus/posterior cingulate voxel, we did not find robust changes that survived a correction for multiple testing across a second pregnancy. This is in line with our previous study that found indications for changes in myo-inositol, total creatine and total choline concentrations across a first pregnancy, but these also did not survive the multiple testing correction2. These results suggest that there is no clear effect across a first or second pregnancy on metabolite concentrations in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex.

Comparisons of the baseline MRI data revealed no significant group differences in any of our presented neural measures of vertex-wise brain volumes, resting-state functional connectivity, white matter tract organization and neural metabolites. This is in line with our findings of changed temporal coherence in the DMN, which reverts to baseline across the first year postpartum2. Previous findings showing changes in white matter organization also indicate that these effects are transient4. However, the changes in gray matter structure seem to be long-lasting. Although a partial reversal to pre-pregnancy baseline has been shown across the postpartum period1,2,3,4, structural alterations were still evident 21 and even 6 years44 after delivery. While the volumetric means at the PRE sess are lower in PRG2 women in brain areas that undergo reductions across a first pregnancy, these are not statistically significantly different. This lack of observed differences in gray matter structure in the pre-pregnancy session between the PRG2 and other groups in our study could be due to the reduced power and sensitivity of cross-sectional analyses, especially because the variation in gray matter volumes at the PRE timepoint is very large. Additionally, the postpartum recovery process is highly dynamic45, with volumetric increases shown across different time points postpartum46,47,48,49, but also volumetric decreases from 1 to 2 years postpartum50. The large range of postpartum time since the first pregnancy in our second-pregnancy group may have masked baseline differences between the PRG2 and other groups in our current study. Future studies examining brain changes across a first and second pregnancy within the same women may provide a deeper insight into the recovery of brain changes in between subsequent pregnancies and the shared and distinct neural effects of successive pregnancies.

Although our manuscript focusses on relatively short-term effects of parity on the brain, studies in late life showing associations between parity and brain structure in middle-aged women suggest that traces of pregnancy-related neural changes may be present throughout the lifespan. Middle-aged women who had undergone multiple pregnancies showed younger-looking brains compared to primiparous and nulliparous women14. Additionally, cortical thickness and functional connectivity was related to parity in elderly women15,16, and reproductive experience may influence the risk for and effects of different diseases in later life, like Alzheimer's Disease and stroke18,23. Similarly, in middle-aged rodents, long-term effects of parity on the immune system and reduced brain aging associated with reproductive experience have been shown, characterized by more neurogenesis, higher levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and more synaptic proteins in the hippocampus9,10,51. Additionally, the response to ovarian hormones at middle age seems to be related to parity in rodents11,12. The differential neural effects of a first and second pregnancy we showed may contribute to these neural effects of parity in late life.

Various limitations of our study need to be considered. First, due to local ethical constraints, we were not allowed by the ethical committee to acquire MRI scans during pregnancy. Therefore, the exact timing of the pregnancy-induced changes cannot be concluded from our analyses. Nevertheless, previous studies examining changes during pregnancy have consistently replicated the changes demonstrated in a pre-post pregnancy design3,4,5. This strong consistency of pregnancy-induced volumetric decreases measured at different time points across pregnancy, characterized by an inverted U-shape from pre to post-pregnancy with the lowest volumes during the third trimester of pregnancy3,4,5, supports the notion that the changes we observed are induced by pregnancy.

Although we demonstrate clear effects on MRI-based measures of cortical volume and white matter tracts across pregnancy, our study cannot reveal any information about the cellular processes that are underlying these changes. Gray matter volume reductions may reflect neurodegeneration, although our previous research has demonstrated a high similarity between morphometric change in pregnancy and adolescence, suggesting that pregnancy-induced brain plasticity may rather reflect a fine-tuning process52,53. Additionally, the cellular processes underlying changes in diffusion-based metrics in white matter tracts are a matter of debate54, and changes in FA or MD could reflect different processes underlying neuroplasticity and learning, such as astrocyte swelling, dendritic spine changes, angiogenesis or synaptic changes41,55,56. Nevertheless, decreases in MD have also been shown during adolescence57,58, further supporting the notion that pregnancy-induced neuroplasticity resembles brain plasticity across adolescence. Results regarding white matter fractional anisotropy or quantitative anisotropy changes in white matter across pregnancy have not been conclusive, with our previous study showing no changes from pre-pregnancy to the early postpartum period2 and another study showing increasing quantitative anisotropy during pregnancy, returning to baseline postpartum in a single women undergoing her first pregnancy4. Different timings of research sessions and different analysis strategies may explain these discrepancies, and more research is needed to fully elucidate the effect of pregnancy on white matter tracts.

Although our study includes a relatively large group of women, especially given the complicated nature and logistics of our longitudinal study design, the group sizes are still limited for classification analyses. To control for the risk of overfitting in small sample sizes, we performed a leave one subject out cross-validation scheme, keeping the training dataset as large as possible to train our classifier. Since it has been shown that the leave-one-out cross-validation can potentially lead to over-optimistic model performance estimations, we repeated our analyses with a k-fold cross-validation scheme with 10 folds, which resulted in a slightly lower accuracy but still significant classification between PRG1 and PRG2. Nevertheless, future research with larger group sizes would be beneficial to confirm our findings.

Because of time constraints during data acquisition, we were able to collect only 5 min of resting-state fMRI data. These data are valuable to compare to our previously published results about resting-state functional connectivity changes in the DMN across a first pregnancy2 that was acquired with the same MRI protocol, but we acknowledge that according to newer standards these data may be limited and should be interpreted with caution, and are therefore presented in the supplement. Future studies acquiring more resting-state fMRI volumes are needed to confirm changes in resting-state functional connectivity across pregnancy.

Lastly, although we tried to match our groups based on demographic variables, there was a significant difference in age between second-time mothers and first-time mothers and control women. Since age is also known to influence cortical volumes59, resting-state functional connectivity60,61 and diffusion-based structural connectivity61, we corrected for age in all analyses. Since these aging effects on functional and structural connectivity are in the opposite direction compared to the pregnancy-induced effects we have found, we do not expect age differences to solely underlie our results. Additionally, there may be other potential confounding factors related to pregnancy that influence the observed changes across a second pregnancy, such as age of first pregnancy, breastfeeding, type of delivery and other contributing factors, such as sleep disturbances, stress or social support. Although our previous findings suggest that several of these factors including sleep, stress, type of delivery and breastfeeding do not strongly contribute to pregnancy-induced brain changes2, it is likely that such factors are associated with relatively subtle effects that only surface in large samples. Studies involving a larger group of women becoming mothers may be able to acquire more insights into the influence of such factors on pregnancy-induced brain changes.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated widespread volumetric decreases across a second pregnancy, which are highly similar to the effects we and others have shown across a first pregnancy1,2,3,4,5. Despite these similarities, women could be classified as having undergone a first or second pregnancy solely based on the changes in their brain structure, indicating that subsequent pregnancies are associated with distinct neural transformations. Both a first and second pregnancy particularly strongly impacted the introspective default mode network and the frontoparietal network and one of its major white matter trats, the superior longitudinal fasciculus. However, these changes were more prominent in a first pregnancy, suggesting a primary adaptation of this network in women who become mothers for the first time that is further fine-tuned during a second pregnancy. Accordingly, the changes in the temporal coherence in the default mode network observed in a first pregnancy were not found in second-time mothers. On the other hand, second-time mothers exhibited stronger structural alterations in the dorsal attention and somatomotor networks including the corticospinal tract, suggesting that a second pregnancy entails an enhanced plasticity within these externally-oriented networks. Correlation results revealed associations of volumetric brain changes across both a first and a second pregnancy with mother-infant attachment, but these were more widespread in first-time mothers. Furthermore, the structural brain changes across both a first and a second pregnancy were associated with maternal mental health, but these were more prominently associated with postpartum depression and psychological distress in the postpartum period in first-time mothers and with depression and psychological distress during pregnancy in second-time mothers. These findings demonstrate that the human brain is altered across a second pregnancy, involving changes in gray matter structure, white matter tracts and resting-state brain activity, and show that both a first and second pregnancy confer a unique mark on a woman's brain.

This research was evaluated and approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Leiden University Medical Center and complies with all relevant ethical regulations. All participants signed the informed consent forms before any study-related measurement and received monetary compensation. We used a prospective pre-conception cohort study, in which we followed women with the intention to become pregnant of their second child in the following year (PRG2: n = 30). Only women (self-reported) were included in this study. We started with a pre-conception research session (PRE session), followed by a session during the third trimester of pregnancy, a session in the early postpartum period (80.32 ± 27.72 days from parturition; POST session) and a session in the late postpartum period (408.67 ± 38.75 days from parturition; POST1 session). Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a subset of women could participate in the POST1 session (n = 14). Due to this low sample size, we just included the POST1 timepoint in analyses where we found a significant pregnancy effect from PRE to POST in the PRG2 group, to study the long-term effects of pregnancy. The pregnancy session only included questionnaires, hormone sampling and cognitive testing, since MRI scanning was not allowed during pregnancy by the ethical committee. Additionally, this study included a primiparous group, including women who became pregnant of their first child during the course of the study (PRG1: n = 40, for the POST1 session n = 28) and nulliparous control women (CTR: n = 40), who underwent a similar study set-up (see Fig. 6)2. All groups were scanned in the same time period, and individuals of different groups were scanned intertwined. For more information about the sample included, see Supplementary Table 20.

We included second time mothers (multiparous; PRG2), first-time mothers (primiparous; PRG1) and control women (CTR) not getting pregnant in between the scans (CTR). We acquired structural T1-weighted, resting-state functional, diffusion-weighted MRI scans and a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scan before pregnancy (Session 1: PRE), in the early postpartum period (Session 3; POST) and the late postpartum period (Session 4; POST1). The pregnancy session only included questionnaires, hormone sampling and cognitive testing, since MRI scanning was not allowed during pregnancy by the ethical committee.

The PRG2 group was significantly older (32.03 ± 2.33 years) than the PRG1 (29.35 ± 3.51 years; p = 0.0027) and the CTR group (29.33 ± 3.57 years; p = 0.0025), so age has been used as a covariate in all analyses. There were no significant differences in level of education, time between PRE and POST sessions, time between birth and POST session and time between birth and POST1 session (Supplementary Table 20).

All MRI scans were acquired on a Philips 3 T MRI system.

High-resolution 3D anatomical T1-weighted images were acquired in transverse orientation, with the following acquisition parameters: repetition time (TR) = 9.8 ms, echo time (TE) = 4.6 ms, Flip Angle = 8°, Field of View (FOV) = 178 × 224 × 168 mm, voxel size = 0.875 × 0.875 × 1 mm. All MRI scans were visually checked for quality control, and no scans had to be excluded. Additionally, we determined Freesurfer's Euler number as a measure of data quality for each T1w image at each time point (Supplementary Table 21), and did not find a significant group (PRG2, PRG1, CTR) * session (PRE, POST, POST1) interaction effect (F(3,254) = 0.42, p = 0.74). After processing in Freesurfer, all individual T1w images had Euler numbers of 2, which reflect an accurate surface reconstruction.

Functional MRI scans were acquired in all participants during rest, while fixating at a crosshair at the screen to prevent them from falling asleep. A total of 137 T2*-weighted whole-brain echo-planar images (EPIs) and two dummy scans were acquired with the following parameters: TR = 2.2 s; TE = 30 ms, Flip Angle = 80°, FOV = 220 × 220 × 111.65 mm, voxel size = 2.75 × 2.75 mm, 37 descending slices.

Two sets of transverse diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were acquired with reversed k-space encoding direction, to allow for distortion correction. For both DWI scans, the acquisition parameters were: TR = 7315 ms, TE = 69 ms, Flip Angle = 90°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm, acquisition matrix = 128 × 98, reconstruction matrix 128 × 128, 30 different diffusion directs with b-factor 1000 s/mm2, 5 B0 acquisitions, SENSE factor = 3, 75 slices of 2 mm, no slice gap, no cardiac gating.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed with single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) localization (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 37 ms; 128 averages, 2 dummy scans, and 16 reference scans without water suppression). Shimming was performed with an automated second order projection-based algorithm. The volumes of interest (VOIs) were positioned in two regions that were found to undergo strong changes in brain structure in our previous study1. One was the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), centered between both hemispheres (Fig. 6a), which had a volume of 8 mL (20 × 20 × 20 mm3). The other VOI was positioned in the right superior temporal gyrus and had a volume of 12 mL (20 × 30 × 20 mm3), but due to low quality spectra, this VOI was excluded from all analyses.

The anatomical MR images were processed with Freesurfer 7.2.0, using the longitudinal recon-all stream62. We performed vertex-wise analyses using cortical volume, thickness and surface area, for which the subject's cortical maps were registered to the fsaverage space and smoothed with a 10 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) kernel. Cortical change maps were created for each measure, and generalized linear models (GLMs), including age as a covariate, were performed to determine differences in the vertex-wise change between each combination of groups (PRG2 vs. CTR, PRG1 vs. CTR and PRG2 vs. PRG1). These linear models were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple testing. We also determined Cohen's D effect sizes for the significant vertices (Supplementary Table 1). In order to allow for slightly less prominent effects to surface, we also used a more lenient approach to correct this contrast for multiple testing than the FDR-correction, using 1000 permutations and a vertex-wise threshold of p < 0.01, corrected for performing analyses in the left and right hemisphere. Cortical volumes were extracted from the total area as output of each GLM, and paired t-tests, or in case of non-normality Wilcoxon signed rank tests, were used to determine the direction of effect in the three groups. These paired t-tests/Wilcoxon signed rank tests were repeated in multiparous (n = 14) and primiparous (n = 28) women with complete datasets, including the late postpartum timepoint (POST1). Differences between groups at the pre pregnancy baseline were determined using linear models corrected for age.

To further investigate differences in brain changes across subsequent pregnancies, we determined whether women undergoing a first or second pregnancy could be separated based on their anatomical MRI scans. To do so, we performed linear support vector machine classification in Pronto (PRoNTo v3.0)24,25 on the smoothed gray matter volume difference maps as output from longitudinal symmetric diffeomorphic modeling pipeline26 in SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.uncl.ac.uk/spm/) implemented in Matlab 7.8 (Mathworks), using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Because of our relatively small sample size for classification analyses, the leave-one-out cross validation provides the largest training dataset as possible, but at the risk of overfitting and overestimating classifier accuracy. Therefore, we repeated the analyses using a k-fold cross-validation using 10 folds, which reduces the risk of overfitting although it's better suited for large sample sizes. Details about the longitudinal pipeline in SPM12 can be found in Hoekzema et al.2. Permutation testing using 10,000 permutations was used to determine the significance of the classification accuracy for all three combinations of groups (PRG2 vs. PRG1, PRG2 vs. CTR and PRG1 vs. CTR).

Lastly, we performed a cluster-wise correction on the results from the above described GLMs with a vertex-wise cluster threshold of 0.001 and a cluster-wise p-threshold of 0.05 to determine clusters of significant volumetric differences. We combined these cluster maps of the results from PRG1-CTR and PRG2-CTR, to determine the similarity and difference in areas affected with a first or second pregnancy compared to control women. This resulted in three areas of interest: areas affected in both a first and second pregnancy (Overlap), areas affected only in a first pregnancy (Only CTR-PRG1) and areas affected only in a second pregnancy (Only CTR-PRG2). To localize these areas in the brain, we determined the intersection of those regions with the 7 resting-state networks of Yeo27, relative to the expected volume of the intersection based on a random distribution across the gray matter in the brain.

The resting state fMRI images were pre-processed using DPARSF (version 4.5)63, involving slice timing correction, realignment, and co-registration of the anatomical images to the mean functional images. The transformed anatomical images were then segmented64, and DARTEL65 was used to transform the images to MNI space, followed by the application of a 10 mm3 FWHM Gaussian kernel. To account for head motion, we applied the Friston 24-parameter model66 and subjects with any frame-wise displacements (FD) exceeding 2 mm (for translations) or 2° (for rotations) or with a mean FD exceeding 0.2 in any of the sessions were excluded67. Therefore, 3 participants of the PRG2 group and 4 participants of the CTR group had to be excluded. After these exclusions, there were no significant group (PRG1, PRG2 and CTRL) * session (PRE and POST) interaction effects in the mean FD or any of the other motion parameters (maximum translations and rotations in the x, y and z-directions) (Supplementary Table 22).

We performed Group spatial independent component analyses (ICA) using the Group ICA for fMRI Toolbox in Matlab (GIFT v4.0b, http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift), using default options, 20 components and the InfoMax algorithm. Components were selected through automated selection by spatial sorting with the components of Smith et al.68 who defined the major networks in the resting brain using a similar ICA-based approach, using a cutoff value of R > 0.25. We compared within-network coherence across the obtained functional networks, by determining the functional connectivity of each voxel with all the other voxels in the network. After determination of the neural networks, we extracted the correlation between the functional networks using the Functional Network Connectivity toolbox (FNC Toolbox version 2.3, https://trendscenter.org/software/fnc/) for Matlab with a lag-shift algorithm using default options. FNC calculates a constrained maximal lag correlation between each pair of networks by calculating Pearson's correlations and constraining the lag between the time courses69.

To examine whether there were differences between groups in the within-network coherence change across the PRE and POST sessions, we performed generalized linear models in SPM12 and investigated the group * session interaction effect using the PRG2 and PRG1 group, and the PRG2 and CTR group. As a follow-up analysis, for the model investigating the default mode network, a region of interest representing the significant within-network coherence change across a first pregnancy2 was applied as mask. In these analyses, we used the average functional connectivity of the voxels inside this mask only with the rest of the DMN. Results were considered significant at an FWE-corrected statistical threshold of p < 0.05. When significant interaction results were obtained, these were followed by paired sample t-tests, or in case of non-normality the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, using the PRE and POST measurement within each group. Baseline differences between groups were determined using linear models corrected for age. For the between-network correlation changes, we performed repeated-measures general linear models in Rstudio (version 23.06.1). In case of significant group * session interaction effects, we performed paired t-tests, or in case of non-normality the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, using the PRE and POST measurement within each group. Results were considered to be significant at a statistical threshold of p < 0.05, corrected for multiple testing using an FDR correction. To create images, the statistical maps were projected onto the PALS surface provided in Caret software (http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret). Slice overlays were created using MRIcron (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/).

Diffusion-weighted images were processed using MRtriX370, unless otherwise stated. We denoised the data, preprocessed the data including eddy current-induced distortion correction, motion correction and susceptibility-induced distortion correction using FSL tools eddy & top-up, and corrected the data for B1 inhomogeneity using dwidenoise, dwifslpreproc and dwibiascorrect, respectively. Subsequently, we fitted the diffusion-tensor and calculated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps. Diffusion tensors were fitted in two steps using dwi2tensor with default settings: first, using weighted least-squares with weights based on empirical signal intensities, and second, by further iterated WLS with weights determined by the signal predictions from the previous iteration. Mean B0 maps were linearly registered using FSL (version 6.0.3) to one individual B0 map, followed by taking the mean to create a study-specific template. Afterwards, individual mean B0 maps were non-linearly registered to the study-specific template, and subsequently to the JHU-ICBM atlas template71. Registrations were inverted, and masks of 11 large white matter tracts of interest were registered to individual subject space. These included the Forceps Major, Forceps Minor, left and right Thalamic Radiation, left and right Corticospinal Tract, left and right Cingulum bundle (Cingulate part and Hippocampal part), Left and right Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, left and right inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, left and right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (Body and temporal part) and the left and right Uncinate Fasciculus. ROI masks in individual space were masked with a fractional anisotropy (FA) mask >0.25, to ensure inclusion of white matter, and mean FA and MD were calculated for each subject at each time point.

General linear models in Rstudio (version 23.06.1) were performed to compare changes in white matter tracts (FA and mean diffusivity (MD)) between the PRE and POST measurements across PRG2 and CTR women, PRG1 and CTR women and PRG2 and PRG1 women. In case of significant group * session interaction effects, we performed paired t-tests, or in case of non-normality the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, using the PRE and POST measurement within each group. Baseline differences between groups were determined using linear models corrected for age. To correct for multiple testing across all white matter tracts per measure (FA or MD), we performed FDR corrections. Lastly, for individuals with a complete PRE-POST-POST1 dataset (PRG2: N = 14, PRG1: n = 28), we performed paired t-tests/Wilcoxon signed rank tests between the PRE and POST1 measurements to investigate the long-term effects of pregnancy.

MRS data of the PRE and POST session were available of 27 women in the PRG2 group, since the spectroscopy had to be omitted in three participants due to a lack of time. The POST1 data was excluded from the MRS analyses because data was only available of four participants in this group. Additionally, MRS data was acquired from 39 PRG1 women and 37 CTR women at the same timepoints (PRE and POST). Metabolite concentrations were estimated with LCModel, (version 6.3-1 M), using a dataset containing seventeen metabolites. For this study, we considered the major metabolites tNAA (N-acetylaspartate including contributions from N-acetylaspartylglutamate), tCr (creatine and phosphocreatine), tCho (phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylcholine), Glu (Glutamate), Ins (myo-Inositol). These metabolites (or combinations thereof) can typically be measured with high precision (see next section about spectral quality). Concentrations were expressed using water scaling. Next, we corrected for partial volume contributions of GM, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid in the corresponding VOI, based on Sienax segmentation (FSL 5.0.10) of each subject's 3DT1 images.

Spectral quality was examined based on the full-width half maximum (FWHM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the estimated CramerRao lower bounds of each metabolite. Spectra with FHWM > 0.1 ppm (12 Hz) and/or SNR < 5 were considered poor quality. All PCC spectra in the PRG2 group had high quality, with SNR mean ± sd of 24.83 ± 1.51, FWHM 4.32 ± 0.51 Hz, and Cramer Rao lower bounds of metabolites well below 10%: tCr 2.06 ± 0.23%, tNAA 2.17 ± 0.38%, Cho 4.50 ± 0.50%, Ins 6.63 ± 0.62%, and Glu 8.00 ± 0.34%. Information about spectra quality in the PRG1 and CTR group can be found in our previous paper2. There were no differences in FWHM and SNR ratio across groups and time points.

The metabolite concentrations resulting from LCModel were analyzed in Rstudio (version 23.06.1), using repeated measures general linear models to assess whether the change in metabolite concentration from PRE to POST was different in PRG2 women, compared to PRG1 and CTR women. In case of significant group * session interaction effects, we performed paired t-tests, or in case of non-normality the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, using the PRE and POST measurement within each group. Baseline differences were determined using linear models corrected for age. These analyses were FDR corrected across the five metabolites as correction for multiple testing.

To measure maternal behavior, we used several questionnaires during pregnancy (at the PREG session) and in the early postpartum period (at the POST session). To assess maternal-fetal attachment during pregnancy, women filled in the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI72) and the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS73). Additionally, to examine nesting behavior, the preparational activities during pregnancy, women filled in the Nesting Behavior Questionnaire74. To assess maternal-child bonding and impairments in the mother-infant relationship in the postpartum period, we asked women to fill in the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS75) and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ76) respectively. Questionnaires were filled in by both the PRG1 and PRG2 group, although some subjects had missing data at a specific time point (PREG: PRG1: n = 36, PRG2: n = 28; POST: PRG1: n = 39, PRG2: n = 28).

We assessed mental health status during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period. To assess psychological distress, women in the PRG1 and PRG2 group filled in the K10 questionnaire77. Additionally, to measure signs of postpartum depression, we acquired data from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS78). For both questionnaires, data were missing from several of subjects (PREG: PRG1: n = 36, PRG2: n = 28; POST: PRG1: n = 39, PRG2: n = 28).

We determined whether there was a difference in maternal behavior or maternal mental health between the PRG1 and PRG2 group using ANOVA analyses. Additionally, we performed correlation analyses in Freesurfer, to assess whether the maternal behavior or mental health status was associated with the volumetric changes across a first or second pregnancy. We applied the significant areas of change across a first or second pregnancy (PRG1 vs. CTR or PRG2 vs. CTR) as mask for these analyses, to only use the area of significant volume decrease across a first or second pregnancy. Results were corrected for multiple testing using 1000 permutations, with a vertex-wise p value of 0.01, and corrected for performing the analyses across the left and right hemisphere.

Cross-coupling of aryl boronic esters forms a cornerstone of how chemists make molecules. More recently, enantiomerically enriched boronic esters have shown great promise in modular synthesis as versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of diverse molecules. A significant challenge in this area is to employ boronic esters for the catalytic construction of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds, especially those where the reaction site is a stereogenic carbon center. Addressing this challenge would not only expand the utility of boronic esters in the modular synthesis of organic frameworks, but also prove more broadly beneficial in the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules.1 In this connection, we have developed a stereospecific C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling reaction catalyzed by a copper acetylide complex. This reaction operates with four-coordinate boron “ate” complexes while remaining inert to simple functional groups including boronic esters, and thereby enables efficient strategies for modular synthesis of complex molecules. Applications to the synthesis of (–)-spongidepsin and the carbon skeleton of fluvirucinine A1 are described.

Cellular-level information is routinely used as part of clinical diagnostics1. Laboratory workers use a microscope to inspect cells on glass slides to detect early signs of cancer in organs such as the lung and bladder. Although this method, called cytology, is a long-established diagnostic procedure, it has major weaknesses. Human interpretation is subjective and labour intensive, and workforce shortages are increasingly a challenge2. Writing in Nature, Nitta et al.3 present an artificial-intelligence approach that offers advantages over current methods in clinical cytology.

Scientists report that a type of giant virus multiplies furiously by hijacking its host's protein-making machinery1 — long-sought experimental evidence that viruses can co-opt a system typically associated with cellular life.

The researchers found that the virus makes a complex of three proteins that takes over its host's protein-production system, which then churns out viral proteins instead of the host's own.

Virologists had already suspected that viruses could perform such a feat, says Frederik Schulz, a computational biologist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the work. But the new findings, published in Cell on 17 February, are an important confirmation. Compared with other viruses, he says, this one “has a more powerful toolbox to really replace what the host is doing”.

Giant viruses, which are so named for their massive genomes, might seem exotic, but they are decidedly commonplace. They tend to infect single-celled organisms called protists — a group that includes amoebae and protozoa — that “are all over the place”, says Eugene Koonin, an evolutionary biologist at the US National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland.

Scientists glimpse oddball microbe that could help explain rise of complex life

The giant DNA virus used in this study, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, has a genome that is about five times larger than those of poxviruses, which have the biggest genomes of any virus that infects humans. Mimivirus is giant in another way too: it is large enough to be seen under a light microscope.

To understand whether the virus affects its host's protein-assembly line, the researchers isolated viral proteins that interact with host organelles called ribosomes. These structures translate RNA molecules into proteins.

The scientists identified three viral proteins that seemed likely to be involved in hijacking host protein production. They then genetically engineered the viruses to lack these proteins and found that viruses that were missing any one of the three multiplied 1,000–100,000 times more slowly than those that did have these proteins.

Organic batteries using abundant and recyclable organic electrode materials provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to commercial lithium-ion batteries1,2,3,4,5, which rely on resource-limited mineral-derived inorganic electrode materials6,7,8. However, the practical use of organic batteries has been severely hindered by the intrinsic insulation and dissolution of organic electrode materials9,10. Here we report practical organic batteries using an n-type conducting polymer cathode, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), which exhibits excellent mixed ionic and electronic transport and low solubility. The PBFDO cathode maintains its n-doped state throughout the electrochemical processes and exhibits stable and reversible redox characteristics, high electrical conductivities and significant lithium-ion diffusion coefficients, without the need for additional conductive additives. Consequently, ultrahigh-mass-loading polymer cathodes, with mass loadings up to 206 mg cm−2, are realized, delivering a high areal capacity of 42 mAh cm−2 and demonstrating robust cycling stability. Furthermore, practical 2.5 Ah lithium–organic pouch cells were fabricated, achieving an impressive energy density of 255 Wh kg−1. Notably, the conducting polymer cathode operates efficiently over a wide temperature range from −70 °C to 80 °C and demonstrates excellent flexibility and safety, marking considerable potential for applications in extreme conditions and wearable electronics.

a, Schematical illustration of the lithium storage processes. Owing to the complexity of conducting polymer resonance and lithium-ion storage mechanisms, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the positions of counter-ions, only a schematic representation of one possible resonance pathway was provided here. The pristine PBFDO, with an n-doping level of around 90%, was first discharged to 1.5 V by lithium-ion uptake. During the subsequent charge process, lithium ions were extracted, while approximately half of protons were also removed, leaving the remaining protons preserved within PBFDO, which also contributed to PBFDO maintaining its n-doped state. Afterward, PBFDO experienced reversible electrochemical reactions, with some protonated carbonyl groups persisting, leading to a reversible capacity of 230.4 mAh g−1. b, XPS spectra of the PBFDO cathode at different charge/discharge states. c, Voltage profiles of the PBFDO cathode at 50 mA g−1 with marked voltages for the FTIR tests. d, FTIR spectra of the PBFDO cathode at different charge/discharge states as indicated in c. e, In situ Raman spectra of the PBFDO cathodes during charge/discharge processes.

No one can say exactly when, or if, gay men started running Silicon Valley. They seem to have dominated its upper ranks at least the past five years, maybe more. On platforms like X, the clues are there: whispers of private-island retreats, tech executives going “gay for clout,” and the suggestion that a “seed round” is not, strictly speaking, a financial term. It is an idea so taken for granted, in fact, that when I call up a well-connected hedge fund manager to ask his thoughts about what is sometimes referred to in industry circles as the “gay tech mafia,” he audibly yawns. “Of course,” he says. “This has always been the case.”

It had been the case, the hedge funder says, back in 2012, when he was raising money from a venture capitalist whose office was staffed with dozens of “attractive, strong young men,” all of whom were “under 30” and looked as though they had freshly decamped from “the high school debate club.” “They were all sleeping with each other and starting companies,” he says. And it is absolutely the case now, he adds, when gay men are running influential companies in Silicon Valley and maintain entire social calendars with scarcely a straight man, much less a woman, in sight. “Of course the gay tech mafia exists,” he continues. “This is not some Illuminati conspiracy theory. And you do not have to be gay to join. They like straight guys who sleep with them even more.”

Ever since I started covering Silicon Valley in 2017, I've heard variations of this rumor—that “gays,” as an AI founder named Emmett Chen-Ran has quipped, “run this joint.” On its face, a gay tech mafia seemed too dumb to warrant actual investigative inquiry. Sure, there were gay men in high places: Peter Thiel, Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Keith Rabois, the list went on. But the idea that they were operating some kind of shadowy cabal seemed born entirely of homophobia, the indulgence of which might play into the hands of conspiracy-minded conservatives like Laura Loomer, who, in 2024, tweeted that the “high tech VC world just seems to be one big, exploitative gay mafia.”

Over time, though, the rumor refused to die, eventually curdling into something closer to conventional wisdom. Last spring, at a venture capitalist's party in Southern California, a middle-aged investor complained to me at length about how he was struggling to raise his new fund. The problem, he explained, boiled down to discrimination. I took him in as he spoke. He had the uniform down cold: a white man with a crew cut, wearing a tasteless button-down stretched over mild prosperity, and a fluent conviction that AI was, thank god, the next big thing. He looked exactly like the sort of man Silicon Valley has been built to reward. And yet here he was, insisting that the system was rigged against him. “If I were gay, I wouldn't be having any trouble,” he said. “That's the whole thing with Silicon Valley these days. The only way to catch a break,” he claimed, “is if you're gay.”

Over the course of 2025, similar sentiments bubbled up on X, where Silicon Valley tech workers joked about offering “fractional vizier services to the gay elite.” Anonymous accounts hinted at an underworld of gay Silicon Valley power brokers who influenced and courted—“groomed”—aspiring entrepreneurs. At an AI conference in Los Angeles, an engineer casually referred to a top AI firm's offices, more than once, as “twink town.”

By the fall, speculation intensified, and then a photo appeared on X of a group of Y Combinator–backed founders crowded near a sauna with Garry Tan, the incubator's president. The image seemed innocuous enough: a few young, nerdy men in swim trunks, squinting into the camera. But almost instantly, it set off a round of viral gossip about the peculiar intimacies of venture capital culture. Not long after, a founder from Germany, Joschua Sutee, posted a photo of himself and his male cofounders—apparently naked, swaddled in bedsheets—submitted as part of what seemed to be a Y Combinator application, a move that appeared designed to court a knowingly erotic male audience. “Here I come, @ycombinator,” the caption read.

The notion that Y Combinator was grooming male entrepreneurs makes little sense—for lots of reasons, and for one in particular. “Garry is straight straight straight straight,” says a person who knows Tan. “But he believes in the benefits of the sauna.” When I ask Tan for a comment, he is blunt—some founders were over for dinner and asked to use his recently installed sauna and cold plunge. From there, Tan says, “rejects” of Y Combinator “manufactured this meme that it was somehow more than that.”

And yet, similar rumors persisted and compounded, originating as often from outsiders (sometimes with dubious political motivations) as from insiders. When I call up my longtime industry sources to get their thoughts on the gay tech mafia, not only have they heard of it—they have highly specific notions of how it works. These are credible people who believe seemingly incredible things. One San Francisco investor tells me that he believes the Thiel Fellowship is a training ground for gay industry leaders. (When I run this notion past a couple of former Thiel Fellows, they tell me they met Thiel one time at a dinner, where he appeared “slightly bored,” says one of the fellows, a straight man. “I mean, I wish Peter tried to groom me.”) Meanwhile, people's gaydars are practically overheating. I hear, more than once, that anyone in Silicon Valley who has achieved outsize success is probably gay.

Isn't it strange, one San Francisco–based venture capitalist muses, how a certain defense-tech executive achieved so much success at a relatively young age? “Isn't he gay?” the VC asks. “He must be.” I tell him he is mistaken—the executive is married to a woman. “Sure,” he replies. “But have you ever seen them together?” Another entrepreneur who raised capital from two well-known gay investors tells me that he's accustomed to fielding scrutiny about his sexual orientation. “People say I'm gay,” he says. “There's always jokes. Like, ‘How'd you get the money, bro?'”

Then there are the anonymous X accounts amplifying allegations of misconduct. Their posts are calibrated for attention: detailed enough to suggest insider knowledge of the Valley, vague enough to invite darker interpretations. I take the bait and, one afternoon in late November, spend nearly an hour texting one such account owner over Signal who agrees to speak to me only if I keep his handle secret.

This person describes the Valley as a place known for “ecstasy, psychedelic fueled gay sex stuff.” Has he experienced any of it himself? No. But he knows people who have—people who are “pretty afraid” and “young af.” He won't name names, won't connect me to anyone, but he swears that any negative rumor I've heard about gay men in Silicon Valley is true. He suggests a conspiracy so sprawling it rivals QAnon and implicates the entire US government. He gives me vague reporting advice: “It should be easy to find. 2nd page of Google type thing.”

Finally, frustrated by his evasiveness, I ask what he thinks will happen if he tells me what he knows. “I truly believe,” he says, “killed.” Then he offers a suggestion. The only way to expose this blockbuster of a tale is “project veritas style: Take a 20 year old dude, make an X acc[ount]. Send him to the right places in SF and you'll break the story if you go deep enough.”

The problem with conspiracy theories, even offensive ones, is that they are rarely wholly invented. They almost always arise from some fragment of truth, which imagination then contorts. The difficulty with this particular rumor is that, while I was unable to substantiate darker allegations, parts of the story still resonate. In conversations with 51 people—31 of them gay men, many of them influential investors and entrepreneurs—a portrait emerged of gay influence in Silicon Valley that is intricate, layered, and often contradictory. It is a world in which power, desire, and ambition interweave in ways both visible and unseen, a world that is, in some ways, far richer—and more complicated—than the rumors themselves suggest.

Most of the people who speak to me for this story do so on the condition that their names be kept confidential. Some of it is just garden-variety caution. “It may not be wise for me to be talking to a reporter describing all these parties,” says one, “because people would be like, Geez, why would we invite you?” Other excuses are murkier: “It's not so safe to speak about this in too much detail,” says a founder who works in AI. “Anyone involved is an operator or a VC, and it might lead people to wonder about who is getting advantages.” Amid the deflections and whispers, though, there seems to be an unmistakable truth: Gay men are rising.

“The gays who work in tech are succeeding vastly,” an angel investor, who is a gay man, tells me. “There's the founder group of gays who all hang out with each other, because the gays always cluster together. By virtue of that, they become friends and vacation together.” Even more importantly: “They support each other, whether that's to hire someone or angel invest in their companies or lead their funding rounds.”

Some of these networks have begun to spill into public view. There is a Substack called Friend Of, written by Jack Randall, who formerly worked in communications at Robinhood, that chronicles gay ascendence into the centers of power. “We run the tech mafia (see Apple, OpenAI),” Randall writes. “We hold top government posts (see the Treasury Secretary). We anchor primetime news and the NYE Ball Drop. Our dating app's stock outperforms its straight peers. And in the US, gay men are, on average, better educated and wealthier than the general population.”

A new company called Sector aims to formalize this network. Founded by Brian Tran, a former designer in residence at Kleiner Perkins, Sector has a website that features photos of handsome men on beaches and at dimly lit dinners. One member describes it to me as a curated network where introductions unfold between well-heeled gay men with shared interests. “It's up to you to decide,” the member tells me. “Is this professional, is it platonic, or is it something romantic?” In an interview with Randall, Tran said, “I think we could displace Grindr in the coming years.”

On any given week in San Francisco, Partiful invites float around the community. If there is a “regular Halloween party, the gays will have their own Halloween party, and Sam Altman will be there,” says Jayden Clark, a straight podcaster who hosts a tech culture podcast and was not invited to the gay Halloween party. (Altman attended dressed as Spider-Man, a nod to Andrew Garfield, who played the superhero and has since been cast as Altman in an upcoming film.) I hear of not one but two White Lotus–themed gay tech parties, both equally extravagant. “Girls are not present,” says that same angel investor. “They are just not there.” There is also a “Gay VC Mafia” group chat that is, as one member describes it, “60 percent business” and “40 percent hee hee ha ha” about “classically gay topics.” With a steady churn of tech events aimed at gay men, the social incentives stack up fast. Connections blur—“professional, physical, or sometimes romantic,” as an AI founder puts it. The pull of this bubble is so strong, he continues, that it's “an uphill battle to socialize with straight people.”

None of this is necessarily unfamiliar in the clubby world of Silicon Valley, where the smart, successful, and wildly rich have always formed in-groups. There's the so-called OpenAI mafia and the Airbnb mafia, and before those the PayPal mafia—alumni of moonshot companies who bankroll the next wave of startups. So some of what reads as advantage is, on closer inspection, structural and unremarkable. San Francisco combines two things in unusual density: one of the country's largest gay populations and a tech industry that has reshaped global power. “For sure, gay men are overrepresented and have had an unbelievable run in the Bay Area,” says Mark, another gay entrepreneur who runs an AI startup. “In a city that has the most venture capital in the world, it isn't surprising that this money is going directly to gay men.” (This perception, for what it's worth, runs counter to statistics: Between 2000 and 2022, the years for which data is available, only 0.5 percent of startup venture funding went to LGBTQ+ founders.) “It's not that there is some kind of gay mafia,” Mark continues. “But if I told you who are my friends that I want to invest in, they happen to be gays. Who are the people without kids who can grind away on the weekends? It's the gays.” (Sources identified in this story by a first name only, like Mark, preferred the use of pseudonyms.)

Imagine this, Mark says: You are a young, nerdy, closeted gay man. You grow up never quite fitting in. Your parents start asking questions. Why don't you have a girlfriend? You tell them you're too busy for a relationship. Eventually, you move to San Francisco, a city that, as one person puts it, is like “Disneyland for gay men.” Your world opens up. You meet other people like you—men who are openly out, many for the first time in their lives. These men happen to be working at influential companies. They are building technology that is astonishing. And slowly it dawns on you: Maybe you, too—a person who has spent a lifetime overlooked and underestimated—can build something extraordinary. “Gays feel,” Mark says, “that they have something to prove.”

This is, more or less, the nature of how power and money have moved throughout networks since the dawn of time. And gay networks seem naturally aligned to the dynamics of venture funding, where established wealth meets emerging talent. “One of the key things to realize is that gays are different than straights in many different ways,” says a longtime gay venture capitalist. “Gays are cross-generational.” While straight people tend to spend more time with people their own age, “that is not true with gay men. I can hang out with someone at an event who is 18 years old, and Peter [Thiel] might also be there.”

Just because you are gay and work in tech does not necessarily mean you are part of the so-called gay tech mafia. Much of the queer spectrum is conspicuously absent from events geared toward gay founders. “There are barriers within the community,” says Danny Gray, a leader at Out Professionals, a networking organization for LGBTQ+ businesspeople. “Cis gay men are the biggest gay group within the acronym, and it is much harder for other letters.” Lesbians tend to be sidelined; when I ask the hyperconnected tech journalist Kara Swisher about the gay tech mafia, she says she wasn't aware there was one. And even if you are a gay man, inclusion is not necessarily guaranteed. “I've found it hard to break into this group myself,” one gay investor tells me. “I probably need to lose 20 pounds.”

It may be that what outsiders perceive as the gay tech mafia is not gay people working in tech, or even, broadly speaking, gay men, but a small, self-selecting group with shared politics and sensibilities. They are assumed to prize aesthetics and the masculine physique, scorn identity politics, reject DEI in favor of MEI—“merit, excellence, and intelligence”—and lean right-wing, if not MAGA. I've heard straight entrepreneurs describe them as “the Greco-Roman gays,” part of “an insular, hypermasculine culture” in which “women are seen as totally redundant and completely unnecessary.” (A woman who once worked for a gay Republican startup founder describes it like this: “You get about the same amount of misogyny, but not the sexual harassment. So that's nice.”)

Where, then, might these almighty power gays be observed in their natural habitat? This is one of the guiding questions in my research, the answer to which perpetually evades me. When I ask a gay investor if perhaps I can attend one of these parties as a fly-on-the-wall observer, he tells me no, because it would be weird, given that I am—unfortunately for the purposes of this story—a woman. “People will be like, ‘Is that your sister?'” he says. I float an idea past my editor that I attend a party disguised as a man. Perhaps, I suggest, we should discuss the budget for my makeover? While not entirely disinterested in the idea, my editor offers another suggestion, that he—a gay man—come along as a kind of chaperone, “for safety” purposes. Neither of us revisits the idea.

There is one place, though, that is mentioned again and again: Barry's, the fitness bootcamp, which has become a gay mecca, thanks in part to the high-profile investor Keith Rabois, who has long been one of its most avid devotees, to the point of teaching occasional classes. And one Barry's in particular keeps coming up: “The Barry's in the Castro is ranked supreme,” says that same gay angel investor. “It is all guys, all gays, and everyone has abs.” (“From what I've learned working here, gay men do love to work out,” confirms a female employee at the Castro Barry's.)

The fact is, most people seem eager to talk about this, no deceptions on my part necessary. Many of them reply almost immediately to my vague inquiries. Even more surprising is their willingness to talk at length. Calls often run for hours, blending measured observations about life in a masculine-dominated culture with tours through the most salacious industry intrigue of my entire career. There can be an edge to the gossip, though—an implication that one of the most reliable paths to power in Silicon Valley may run through the bedroom. Some men are eager to hop on a call to ask what I may or may not have already heard about them. One gay founder tells me how a rumor has been circulating (a version of which I have, in fact, heard) that he and his husband slept with a gay investor in exchange for a down payment on their home. “Do people really think,” he wonders, “that we can't afford a condo?”

Many have, at some point or another, been suspected of romantic involvement, even if they've never been in the same room together. When I call up Ben Ling, an investor and early Google employee, to ask about long-standing speculation that he might be a good match for Tim Cook—a pairing intriguing enough to be referenced in The Atlantic—he laughs. “People make up these rumors because they have nothing better to do,” he says. “Tim Cook does not know who I am.”

And while it is true that at least some of these men know and see each other socially, these meetups do not reliably lead to romance. A friend of Rabois tells me that Rabois likes to tell a story of the time, years earlier, when he invited Sam Altman as his plus-one to an event. “He said that Sam brought two phones and was texting on both of them the entire time,” the friend says. “Keith says it was the worst date he ever went on.” (Use of the word “date” has, by relevant parties, been disputed.)

For rising figures who have formed genuine friendships with powerful gay industry leaders, success sometimes comes with a penalty: the assumption that it is borrowed, not earned. Brad, a gay industry leader, has long lived with rumors about his friendship with Peter Thiel—rumors that followed him even as his career advanced. “When I started working with Peter so long ago, people would be like, Oh, did you sleep with him? Blah blah blah.” The answer, he says, is no. And yet, “for some reason everyone felt perfectly comfortable asking me about it. Straight people were interested in it generally, but the people who were really fucking fascinated were other gay guys. Guys would be like: What does he have that I don't have? So then they assume, Well, Peter must have thought you were cute.” (Thiel did not respond to requests for comment.)

Still, it's naive to insist that intimacy with power is without its advantages. When Altman's former boyfriend, early Stripe employee Lachy Groom, raised a $250 million solo venture fund while still in his twenties, some observers read the achievement less as an anomaly of talent, I'm told, than as an artifact of access. This interpretation, according to a gay investor close to both Groom and Altman, is not entirely fair: “When Lachy and Sam were dating, Sam was kind of famous, but not nearly as famous as he is now, and Lachy was a person in his own right,” the investor says. “I did give a reference to [an investor in Groom's fund] saying, ‘Yes, he's unproven as an investor, yes, he's young. But he is in the network, and he is Sam's ex-boyfriend.' But Lachy didn't date Sam to get these things.” (Groom declined to comment on the record, as did a representative for Altman.)

Meanwhile, when straight men attempt to tap into the gay network, the gay investors chat amongst themselves. Mark, who hosts dinner parties and events for the gay tech community in San Francisco, says that he noticed one man constantly RSVPing to his events. “We don't have a purity test,” he says, “but someone said that guy is definitely not gay, he just goes to the gay man events because he wants deal flow.” It isn't like straight men are excluded per se, but they are not exactly a welcome addition to the world of gay capital. The joke, if a straight founder does show up, is: Just don't tell anyone you're straight.

“I have seen straight men do untoward things,” says a gay investor. “There is a straight guy who is not important enough to be named who would pitch all the gay investors, and in one meeting at the VC partnership he was talking to a gay general partner who I know. And in the meeting, this guy put his hand on the GP's leg under the table. It is so inappropriate. It became a running joke, like, not this guy again.”

One person in particular has helped fuel the notion that being gay can benefit one's career: Delian Asparouhov, the mischievous, 31-year-old cofounder of Varda Space Industries, who was once hired as Rabois' chief of staff. Rabois, who helped Thiel start PayPal and was later a partner at Thiel's venture firm, Founders Fund, was a subject of corporate scrutiny years earlier. While at Square, Rabois was accused of sexual harassment by a male colleague, an episode that ultimately ended with Rabois' departure from the company. (After an internal investigation, the company backed Rabois.)

In 2018, about 100 people attended Rabois' wedding to Jacob Helberg, a former adviser at Palantir who currently serves as the US undersecretary of state for economic growth. The wedding was a multiday affair with a guest list that included many of the most important people in tech and culminated in a beachside wedding ceremony officiated by Sam Altman. (Rabois' bad “date” with Altman resulted, apparently, in close friendship.)

During the wedding, Asparouhov gave a toast, which was later recalled by Fred, a longtime gay tech leader who was in attendance. “Delian said something like, ‘I'm the intern that Keith hired, and I would wear short shorts and tank tops at Square.'” Fred says he was sitting at a table with two famous tech executives. “We just raised our eyebrows,” Fred continues. “It was so embarrassing that Delian would say that at someone's wedding. I mean, here was Keith getting married to Jacob.” (Other wedding attendees claim not to remember the contents of the speech but say it sounds like Asparouhov.)

Rumors of Asparouhov and Rabois' dating lives have long traveled in industry circles, thanks in part to Asparouhov, who has fanned the flames online. (“Delian is like Gretchen Wieners,” explains Fred.) In 2022, a popular anonymous tech insider X account, Roon, tweeted that it was “crazy how venture capitalists have reinvented the Roman system of pederasty.” Asparouhov responded to the tweet almost immediately: “It only took a little gay and now I get to work on space factories,” he wrote. “Pretty reasonable trade.” He now says the tweet was “obviously a joke.”

But as Fred recounted, Asparouhov was known for wearing neon tank tops, short shorts, and mismatched shoes when he joined Square in 2012. “He would jump a lot—it was very odd,” says someone who worked at the company at that time. Others have similar recollections. OpenStore, the Miami-based company Rabois cofounded in 2021, which mostly shut down last year, seemed to be, according to John, who says he visited its offices, “almost like a harem, filled with jacked white men, all of them handsome and good-looking, straight and gay. People were wearing kind of inappropriate clothing: really short shorts and tight shirts even though the AC was blasting.” Rabois, when I ask him for a comment, denies this categorically. “Attire was quite standard for Florida,” he says. “And I doubt more than two of the 100-plus employees could be reasonably described as ‘jacked.'”

Rabois has been known to take extravagant vacations—helicopter trips to Icelandic volcanoes, white-water rafting in Costa Rica. Exclusion can stir serious envy, as it did with one young gay tech consultant I speak with who says he has begun a kind of “micro-journalism” project to track the appearances of a couple of guys on Rabois' Instagram. These are “low-level” workers, he says, who nonetheless are “always posting photos in St. Barts.” “Here I am doomscrolling on the A train, and I'm like, ‘How are these guys on a private jet?'”

But how far back do these rumors really go? Has Silicon Valley always been semi-secretly, kinda-sorta gay? More than once, I'm told to connect with Joel, a gay man who works in tech and who spent a lot of time among the older in-group of powerful gay men in Silicon Valley, more than a decade ago. “So,” I say when he answers my call, “are you a member of the gay tech mafia?” He laughs. “Maybe someone thinks I'm in it, which is why you're calling me.”

When I ask Joel to explain how the gay tech mafia works, he tells me that it's similar to people who “went to the same college or came from a similar background or a similar town.” And it indeed started, he says, with people like Rabois and Thiel, who, after they rose to power, “brought a lot of people along. Keith hired gays at Square, and Peter hired Mike [Solana] at Founders Fund. Then there was a cohort of Google gays that Marissa Mayer ran in 2010. And there is Sam, who is friends with Keith, and Sam was running in parallel, assembling other gays around him.”

Joel tells me about the parties at the time—the exact specifics of which remain off the record. But they were, in summary, what you might expect. “There was lots of drinking that would turn into weird situations. Random people hooking up. Generally, there was a sexual tone.” But this was years ago. These types of parties, at least from what I've heard, have either disappeared or moved entirely underground. (“Once you get to the end of your reporting, you will find that the real story is much less explosive,” says Mark. “Like all these wild orgies: If you do find out where they are, please tell me, because I'd like to go.”)

I tell Joel that I've heard from some young men in the tech industry who feel pressured to sleep around to get ahead. Was that true in his experience? “Mmmmm,” he says, and pauses. Then he bursts out laughing. “I mean, in all of this, there are weird gray areas. It can be very sexual. It is not all professional. A lot of people have dated or slept with each other.” He had experienced a kind of coercion firsthand. “I definitely felt pressured to do—not overtly illegal things. But they walked the line.” Joel is older now, and while he can see how someone might describe this as an abuse of power, he resists the framing. The exchange of sex and status may not be the reason these men rose so quickly, but it can be a factor—if only because sex, as he puts it, “makes people become closer rapidly.”

As Silicon Valley has matured into the power center of the world, it has grown sharply cutthroat. Leverage is scarce, and ambition is often laced with a kind of ruthless opportunism. In gay circles, some feel the Valley resembles the old Hollywood casting couch. Many of the critics are rising gay entrepreneurs and investors themselves, for whom parts of the gay community seem steeped in the attitudes and values of the 1970s and '80s. “There's this feeling,” one observes, “that because there were years of historical oppressions only recently recognized, certain people think, ‘I can do this, or I deserve this, because no one will cancel me for it.'”

This is a community that, as one young gay investor describes it, is “power-hungry, network-driven, and, at times, very horny.” The arrangement, he suggests, is tacitly understood by everyone involved: “Both sides know they are in the game and want something from each other. Which is fine, I guess, if you're into that.” This is not, in his telling, the whole of the gay tech scene, most of which is a “lovely, amazing community that supports its people and their career progress.” But alongside that exists a sexual undercurrent—one that, he insists, is impossible to deny and especially pronounced in AI circles. “It's like a gay nepo thing,” he says. “While it's not explicitly for sexual favors, there is an element at work in the background. Like, you're young and you're hot and I'm down to hook up.”

One gay man, Dean, describes moving through a professional world in which sexual suggestion flowed freely. Early on, it came from limited partners curious about his prospective fund; after he raised the fund, it came from founders seeking capital. In one instance, a potential limited partner proposed a meeting at his home. “He was like, ‘We don't need to wear clothes, we can just sit around and talk about your fund in my hot tub.'” Dean frames these encounters as an irritation—ambient, expected, and largely inconsequential. “Sex is devalued in gay male culture,” he says. “Often, it's just another piece of currency.”

After Dean raised his fund, he was occasionally approached by young men, “founders looking for money who indicated they were open to whatever it takes to raise it.” At events geared toward LGBT founders, young men would ask to grab drinks one on one. Sometimes, they'd send nudes on Instagram. “Like ‘Hey …' with a winky face. And ‘Do you like that?' And I'd be like, ‘No, that's actually inappropriate,'” he says. It's not confined to Silicon Valley, he adds. Having left tech for a different industry, Dean has come to see the entanglement of sex, power, and ambition as a recurring feature of certain pockets of gay professional life.

Another man who works in the queer tech space puts it this way: “There is an aspect of being queer and in business and in life and having relationships that can be frankly sexual and not sexual at the same time. You can turn off and do business with someone you were hooking up with yesterday.” Plus, he continues, there is the inescapable fact that much of gay male culture tends to be sexually charged. “Straight guys have the golf course. Gay guys have the orgy,” he says. “It doesn't mean it's problematic. It's consensual, but it is a way we bond and connect.”

Of the 31 gay men I spoke to for this story, nine tell me they experienced unwanted advances from other gay men in the industry. Some of these advances were mild but annoying: repeated invitations to soak in hot tubs or explore wine cellars. Others involved unwanted touches. One person, an up-and-coming gay investor, tells me that he believes that turning down a sexual advance from a senior colleague cost him a job. Multiple sources speak of “sex pests” who send unsolicited dick pics and make overt come-ons.

“What demoralizes me in the conversations around the gays in tech in San Francisco is that none of this is entirely a secret,” says one gay investor who experienced an unwanted sexual advance. “People are aware this is an issue.” Another gay man who works in tech adds: “There is an element to this story that is a cautionary tale. You take a brilliant entrepreneur who has a great idea trying to make it in the world of venture capital. And then they have to put up with someone sending them dick pics and asking for an investment meeting. It shouldn't be normalized. And right now, everything is so gray. Like, it's our little thing, our little world. But it has a massive impact.”

Again and again, gay men working in tech ask me: Why has this story never been written? The question somewhat answers itself. Unfair stereotypes about gay men persist, and why else would sources insist on pseudonyms? I am warned, more than once, to be careful, that figures in Silicon Valley are “vindictive.” Even as many consider this culture of sexual pressure a feature of Silicon Valley life, it is, as someone else tells me, “a true minefield” to write about.

Gerald knows the feeling. He's a young gay man in San Francisco, described by acquaintances as a “quirky individual” and a “social puppeteer.” Over a call, Gerald lays out the reasons he has hesitated to talk about his time in tech. “This is a complex subject,” he says, “and I don't think readers can draw the distinction between some bad men being gay and all gay men being bad. It can be a slippery slope into homophobia.”

He won't give his story to me. Not yet. But he does tell me he suspects that other stories, in the coming months, will surface. “People have a difficult time articulating power with nuance,” he says. “This is not just one story. There will be many.” From what he's told me so far, and from everything else I've heard—the heartfelt, late-night confessions over the phone; the insights shared quietly and kept off the record; the admissions of dozens of funny, brilliant, young gay men competing for, yes, power and money and recognition, but also for love, romance, and a place to belong in the heart of San Francisco—I believe him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Mark Zuckerberg Tries to Play It Safe in Social Media Addiction Trial Testimony","https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-testifies-social-media-addiction-trial-meta/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 02:04:00 GMT","

Mark Zuckerberg walked somewhat stiffly into a courtroom of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County at 9 am on the dot on Wednesday, having first been escorted into the building by a security detail that included two Department of Homeland Security officers. The venue, overseen by Judge Carolyn Kuhl, was bursting with spectators and media, many crammed elbow-to-elbow on benches, all there to witness the Meta CEO testify before a jury about allegations that his company's products pose serious risks to younger users.

Specifically, Zuckerberg was on hand to answer questions as to whether Meta products such as Facebook and Instagram were intentionally engineered to be addictive—as well as allegations that the tech giant had deliberately targeted tweens and teens with engagement-boosting strategies that led to mental health crises. It was to be a crucial showdown in a lawsuit brought by a now 20-year-old Californian identified as K.G.M. (although her counsel usually referred to her by her first name, Kaley) and her mother against Meta, YouTube, Snap, and TikTok back in 2023. They allege that her compulsive use of those platforms accounts at an extremely young age caused severe psychological damage.

After Meta and Google failed to get the case dismissed in November, Snap and TikTok settled out of court, leaving the other companies to face the first of nearly two dozen so-called bellwether trials about social media addiction currently on the docket in Los Angeles. These are the cases selected as representative of a much larger pool of litigants—some 1,600 in total—who have filed suits against the same brands on similar grounds, alleging that their children fell victim to depression, dysmorphia, and suicide after they got hooked on apps that absorbed their attention. The families of some of these children were among those vying for a chance to finally see Zuckerberg in the hot seat on Wednesday.

K.G.M.'s counsel, Mark Lanier, launched into his examination of Zuckerberg by putting the 41-year-old executive's credibility under the microscope. Lanier picked apart claims Zuckerberg had made under oath in January 2024 during congressional testimony about online child safety. While Zuckerberg had claimed that children under 13 are not allowed on Instagram, Lanier showed that in 2015 the platform internally estimated that there were then 4 million Instagram users under age 13, comprising 30 percent of 10- to 12-year-olds in the US. While Zuckerberg previously claimed that the Meta team does not receive directives to increase the time users spend on their platforms, Lanier produced a 2015 goal-setting email from Zuckerberg that listed this as the first item.

Elsewhere, Lanier sought to establish Zuckerberg's ultimate decisionmaking authority over Meta and quoted a remark he made in an interview with Joe Rogan last year: “Because I control our company, I have the benefit of not having to convince the board not to fire me,” he'd told the podcast host. Zuckerberg insisted in court that this was merely a “simplified” version of the truth.

Over the course of his testimony, Zuckerberg was oddly evasive about even insignificant details and basic definitions. He was not quite prepared to confirm that his relevant congressional testimony had taken place on January 31, 2024, for example, and was hesitant to agree with Lanier's proposition that when something is “addictive,” people “do it more.” He ultimately hedged: “Maybe in the near term.” Zuckerberg also preferred to acknowledge any past comment, in probabilistic fashion, by saying, “It sounds like something I would have said.” Likewise, when asked whether internal documents appeared to suggest Meta's interest in maximizing “total teen time spent” on their apps, he often replied, “That's what the document says.”

Zuckerberg repeatedly fell back on accusing Lanier of ""mischaracterizing"" his previous statements. When it came to emails, Zuckerberg typically objected based on how old the message was or his lack of familiarity with the Meta employees involved. “I don't think so, no,” he replied when directed to clarify whether he knew Karina Newton, Instagram's head of public policy in 2021. And Zuckerberg never failed to point out when he wasn't actually on an email thread entered as evidence.

Perhaps anticipating these detached and repetitive talking points from Zuckerberg—who claimed over and over that any increased engagement from a user on Facebook or Instagram merely reflected the “value” of those apps—Lanier early on suggested that the CEO has been coached to address these issues. “You have extensive media training,” he said. “I think I'm sort of well-known to be pretty bad at this,” Zuckerberg protested, getting a rare laugh from the courtroom. Lanier went on to present Meta documents outlining communication strategies for Zuckerberg, describing his team as “telling you what kind of answers to give,” including in a context such as testifying under oath. “I'm not sure what you're trying to imply,” Zuckerberg said. In the afternoon, Meta counsel Paul Schmidt returned to that line of questioning, asking if Zuckerberg had to speak to the media because of his role as head of a major business. “More than I would like,” Zuckerberg said, to more laughter.

In an even more, well, “meta” moment after the court had returned from lunch, Kuhl struck a stern tone by warning all in the room that anyone wearing “glasses that record”—such as the AI-equipped Oakley and Ray-Ban glasses sold by Meta for up to $499—had to remove them while attending the proceedings, where both video and audio recordings are prohibited.

K.G.M.'s suit and the others to follow are novel in their sidestepping of Section 230, a law that has protected tech companies from liability for content created by users on their platforms. As such, Zuckerberg stuck to a playbook that framed the lawsuit as a fundamental misunderstanding of how Meta works. When Lanier presented evidence that Meta teams were working on increasing the minutes users spent on their platforms each day, Zuckerberg countered that the company had long ago moved on from those objectives, or that those numbers were not even “goals” per se, just metrics of competitiveness within the industry. When Lanier questioned if Meta was merely hiding behind an age-limit policy that was “unenforced” and maybe “unenforceable,” per an email from Nick Clegg, Meta's former president of global affairs, Zuckerberg calmly deflected with a narrative about people circumventing their safeguards despite continual improvements on that front.

Lanier, though, could always return to K.G.M., who he said had signed up for Instagram at the age of 9, some five years before the app started asking users for their birthday in 2019. While Zuckerberg could more or less brush off internal data on, say, the need to convert tweens into loyal teen users, or Meta's apparent rejection of the alarming expert analysis they had commissioned on the risks of Instagram's “beauty filters,” he didn't have a prepackaged response to Lanier's grand finale: a billboard-sized tarp, which took up half the width of the courtroom and required seven people to hold, of hundreds of posts from K.G.M.'s Instagram account. As Zuckerberg blinked hard at the vast display, visible only to himself, Kuhl, and the jury, Lanier said it was a measure of the sheer amount of time K.G.M. had poured into the app. “In a sense, y'all own these pictures,” he added. “I'm not sure that's accurate,” Zuckerberg replied.

When Lanier had finished and Schmidt was given the chance to set Zuckerberg up for an alternate vision of Meta as a utopia of connection and free expression, the founder quickly gained his stride again. “I wanted people to have a good experience with it,” he said of the company's platforms. Then, a moment later: “People shift their time naturally according to what they find valuable.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Organize Safely in the Age of Surveillance","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-organize-safely-in-the-age-of-surveillance/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

Rarely in modern US history have so many Americans opposed the actions of the federal government with so little hope for a top-down political solution. That's left millions of people seeking a bottom-up approach to resistance: grassroots organizing.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

Yet as Americans assemble their own movements to protect and support immigrants, push back against the Department of Homeland Security's dangerous incursions into cities, and protest for civil rights and policy changes, they face a federal government that possesses vast surveillance powers and sweeping cooperation from the Silicon Valley companies that hold Americans' data.

That means political, social, and economic organizing presents a risky dilemma. How do you bring people of all ages, backgrounds, and technical abilities into a mass movement without exposing them to monitoring and targeting by a government—and in particular Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, agencies with paramilitary ambitions, a tendency to break the law, and more funding than some countries' militaries.

Organizing safely in an age of surveillance increasingly requires not only technical security know-how, but also a tricky balance between secrecy and openness, says Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital civil liberties. “You may want to limit access to some information to a smaller group of people, and you need to consider the platforms you are using, so that when law enforcement shows up to Google with a subpoena, there's nothing sensitive it can hand over,” says Galperin. “But you have to weigh that against the fact that the majority of organizing is done in public, with other people, because the power of organizing is in numbers and solidarity.”

There's no simple set of tech tips that can help organizers safely build a movement while facing that dilemma, but there are approaches, guidelines and tools that can help. WIRED asked technologists, activists, aid groups, and cybersecurity experts for their guidance on how to organize and collaborate in an age of surveillance. Here's what we found.

The first step to safer and more surveillance-resistant organizing is what digital security experts and organizers call “threat modeling”: Gaming out what potential adversaries might seek to surveil and what needs to be protected. That means creating clear delineations around what information can be public or which conversations can happen on less private platforms, versus which aspects of your organizing must stay secret. You'll almost certainly need a mix of both approaches.

“If you have no rules on what should or should not be encrypted or secured, then you're going to want to encrypt every single thing,” says Matt Mitchell, a former founder and security trainer at CryptoHarlem and now CEO of the risk-mitigation firm Safety Sync Group. “It comes from a good place, but that creates a lot of barriers and makes it more likely that someone will make mistakes.”

EFF's Galperin suggests one guideline is to think about what will inherently become public anyway and when. You may want to keep the time and place secret for a small in-person planning meeting, but if something is going to soon be in the open—like the organizing of a massive rally that involves seeking permits from city officials—there's less pressure to lock down the planning.

Galperin warns that too much secrecy can be unwelcoming for new members of a movement and self-defeating. “A very, very large part of activism is telling people what you're doing,” she says. “It's casseroles and phone trees. It is deeply unsexy, but also not secret work.”

Taylor Fairbank, cofounder of the humanitarian relief group Distribute Aid, says, for example, that most of the logistics and communication work the organization does to connect specific supplies with communities in need can be done—or even must be done—in the open or on platforms that could be surveilled. “I will never be able to leave Facebook because I have the cutest grandparents in the UK who reach out to me once a year offering a bunch of knitted hats and sweaters to send to a refugee camp in Europe,” he says. “It's my job to be available and to be on insecure tools to help match those opportunities and translate that across geographical boundaries.”

Crucially, though, some information, like the locations of Distribute Aid warehouses, is carefully protected. “We will never post warehouse addresses online, because we have seen our warehouses and our partners' warehouses get targeted for theft and political violence,” Fairbank says. “I really recommend explicitly identifying sensitive data and holding that close.”

That means considering, for every kind of collaboration or communication, whether and how it needs to be protected. For each element of an organization's digital footprint that truly must stay secret, you'll need to take measures to encrypt it, delete it after a certain time, store it under your own control instead of in the cloud—or both. The next section includes some of the tools and tactics experts recommend.

TLDR: Trying to keep everything secret is neither practical nor always desirable. Instead, create a threat model: Identify what's sensitive, make an effort to protect it by encrypting it, storing it in a safe place, or deleting it after a certain time—and worry less about the stuff that will eventually be public anyway.

The core, default tool for text and voice communications recommended by every activist and security expert WIRED spoke to remains the encrypted messenger Signal. That's because Signal is end-to-end encrypted—meaning that only the phones or PCs of the participants in a conversation can decrypt its communications—and it's battle-tested, free, open source, popular, and simple enough to allow seamless onboarding of new members of an organization. Unlike WhatsApp, which also uses Signal's encryption protocol for its own end-to-end encrypted messaging and calls, Signal doesn't log metadata such as who is calling or texting whom, a crucial privacy feature. Finally, Signal has become increasingly reliable, even for group video calls, making it a key alternative to not only email but also Zoom or other video meeting tools.

A few practices can still vastly increase the security Signal offers. Just as important, perhaps, as Signal's encryption is its disappearing message feature, which lets you keep messages for a set amount of time, from four weeks to as little as 30 seconds. Turn it on. Even with a countdown clock as long as one week for less sensitive conversations, you'll significantly reduce the risk of your organization's communications leaking. Also, take advantage of Signal's username feature rather than asking new members for their phone number, which can further limit a group's potential exposure of identifying contact info.

As your organization's Signal groups grow, however, keep in mind that encryption doesn't offer magical protection from leaks by a group's members—a lesson made all too clear by the Trump administration's SignalGate scandal. As a Signal group grows beyond a certain size, it's likely that newly invited members haven't been strictly vetted. “If your group has more than 50 people in it, it's not a private space for communication,” says Galperin. Keep truly sensitive information to the smallest possible groups, or to one-on-one communications.

End-to-end encryption, too, only offers as much security as the devices on either end. Group members should set up authentication to access the Signal app itself—go to Screen Lock under the Privacy menu in Signal's settings. For organization members with access to sensitive data and Signal groups, make sure everyone has set up a strong passcode, and consider disabling biometric access for that screen lock. Better yet, turn off all biometric access to the phone or computer Signal is running on, given that face- or fingerprint-based unlocking methods have fewer Fourth Amendment protections from law enforcement searches. (As the case of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson demonstrated, biometric access to a PC with a Signal desktop app can give authorities access to your linked Signal account, no matter how carefully you've locked down your phone.)

If that level of security is too cumbersome, Galperin suggests that applying it to a second device intended for sensitive organizational communications. Think of it not so much as a “burner phone” as an “alt phone” with more security measures. This can be a good practice for members of a group with the most reason for caution. “Compartmentalization is good,” Galperin says, “so that you don't mix up these two parts of your life—one where you have to be extremely careful and one where you can kind of just live your normal life and do your work.”

In recent years, plenty of other encrypted communications apps have risen in popularity in the security community, some of which have been touted as superior to Signal, such as SimpleX, Session, and forks of Signal—which aren't interoperable with Signal itself. But none of the experts WIRED asked about these alternatives recommended switching, in part due to their relative lack of testing and the organizational cost of asking people to use a less familiar, often more complex tool. They also warned against using private messaging features on social media apps, despite their convenience for organizers, due to those tools' relative lack of privacy promises or strong encryption.

One communication tool that Signal can't easily replace, the security experts WIRED spoke to conceded, is Slack. The app's flexible group messaging and notification features often make it feel far more efficient than Signal for complex organizing among teams. But given that Slack has no end-to-end encryption or disappearing message features and is centrally hosted by a company that responds to law enforcement requests, it represents a potential privacy nightmare for organizers, warns Harlo Holmes, a security trainer and director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. (All of this applies to Discord as well.) She points out that even the name originally stood for Searchable Log of all Communications and Knowledge—not a good place to keep sensitive information safe. “Slack is designed to feel like the water cooler, so you can just say what you want,” Holmes says. “But it's not your friend.” (Disclosure: WIRED's global editorial director sits on the Freedom of the Press Foundation's board.)

As a safer alternative, Holmes and other cybersecurity experts recommended tools like Mattermost and Matrix, which feature more security measures: Matrix offers end-to-end encryption, both tools offer timed auto-deletion for messages, and both can be self-hosted—set up on a server your organization owns and runs itself, rather than one in the hands of a company like Slack. Self-hosting presents its own significant security challenges—more on that below—but may still be preferable to putting all your communications history in the hands of a third-party firm that could offer little resistance or transparency when an authority figure demands the company hand it over.

TLDR: Use Signal for as many texts, calls, and video chats as possible, and set up disappearing messages. Just remember that encryption isn't magic. Consider the security of the devices on each end of the conversation—and how much you trust everyone in it.

Organizing involves a lot of, well, organization. Whether you need a spreadsheet to schedule community watch slots with your neighbors or a set of planning documents that multiple group members can regularly update, cloud-based tools that sync automatically like the Google Docs Suite or Microsoft Office 365 will naturally be most people's go-to. But they also leave your group's information in the hands of Google or Microsoft, which can revoke your access if they choose to or hand your data over to any federal agency that legally demands it.

That presents a tough decision: These types of tools are undeniably vulnerable to surveillance, but they're recognizable and accessible—essential attributes when you are potentially collaborating with people of all different backgrounds and ages.

There's an expensive solution to that quandary: Organizations with a big budget can pay to implement an enterprise “client side” encryption scheme, using a platform like Google Docs but managing the encryption keys for their data with a third party like Virtru, so Google or another platform provider is shut out. For regular people who can't afford to spend thousands of dollars a year on such a setup, though, experts say there's still a place in most threat models for normal, unencrypted Google Docs—as long as you understand the risks.

“Will Google hand over your data to the feds if they serve them with a subpoena? Yes. Is it still basically a functional tool for the thing that you're trying to do? Yeah,” says Evan Greer, the director of nonprofit advocacy group Fight for the Future. “And would I tell you to switch to some cool open-source alternative in the middle of the fight? Not necessarily. We're in a crisis moment right now. I want organizers out there fighting and organizing, not figuring out how to configure their email.”

The good news is that, if you do need to prioritize security in collaboration tools without the expense of an enterprise client-side encryption setup, there's a growing list of cheaper options that are still safer than the mainstream, consumer cloud. The Switzerland-based company Proton offers a suite of end-to-end encrypted tools, including its flagship email service Proton Mail as well as Docs, Sheets, Calendar, and Drive.

(A note here about the Proton Mail part of that suite of tools: Keep in mind that if you use it, your emails are only end-to-end encrypted when messaging with other Proton Mail accounts. If you email a Gmail account from Proton Mail, your message is treated like any other on Google's end. Better to stick with Signal, which isn't interoperable with messaging platforms that aren't end-to-end encrypted, so it's harder to make a mistake that exposes your communications.)

Free Proton accounts come with 1 GB of storage, and the company offers $13- and $20-per-month plans that include more storage and other features like expanded account protection. Proton also has business products for large organizations. (For cloud storage, another Swiss company called Tresorit offers an end-to-end encrypted option that's not open source, but that some experts recommended.)

Offering synchronous collaboration tools while keeping everything end-to-end encrypted is complex, and Proton's offerings aren't quite as easy to use or chock full of features as traditional web platforms. (Its word processor doesn't even split documents into pages, Safety Sync's Matt Mitchell points out.) But the fact that the user interface is straightforward and familiar goes a long way—an approach the company has been focused on for years now.

Proton products are open source and independently audited. Keeping the company's operations in Switzerland also provides some additional legal protections on data privacy. Multiple sources noted to WIRED, though, that there have been situations where law enforcement compelled Proton to produce metadata about certain customers, including a case in 2021 where Proton logged the IP address and device ID of a French activist at the behest of Swiss law enforcement.

Better than a server owned by a Swiss company, in some respects, is one your organization owns and controls itself. Fight for the Future's Greer points to “self-hosted” options as another approach to making your organization's data less resistant to surveillance: Nextcloud offers a Google Docs-like collaboration suite that organizations can set up on their own server—a kind of “private cloud.” Another tool set called Cryptpad offers the same self-hosted option and also end-to-end encrypts your data. That keeps data out of the hands of an untrusted company, while still keeping it protected, in theory, even if your organization's own Cryptpad server is seized or compromised.

A major warning here, however: Self-hosting is hard. It requires a dedicated IT person to maintain infrastructure, keep a network secure, update software, and respond–sometimes in the middle of the night—if a server crashes. “People doing activism talk about hosting things locally and think it will be more secure. That depends: How good a systems administrator are you?” says the EFF's Galperin. “Let me tell you, trying to keep your server up and running and secure is not a part-time job. It is very, very hard to do correctly.”

For a well-resourced, sufficiently tech-savvy organization, however, it can be a powerful option. Fight for the Future, for instance, has over the last year largely “de-Googled,” Greer says, switching most of its tooling to end-to-end encrypted or self-hosted alternatives including Signal, Nextcloud, Matrix, and the self-hosted wiki tool Outline. (Greer adds that the move was partly driven by security, and partly by a sentiment she describes as “fuck these Big Tech monopolists, we don't want to use their software if we don't have to.”) Distribute Aid's Fairbank notes that some nonprofit organizations, like Movement Infrastructure Research and Rise Against Big Tech, may be able to offer assistance.

One more risk to keep in mind: Web-based services offer the convenience of being able to access them from any browser, but if the encryption underlying a secure platform is compromised—say, by a company legally compelled to undermine its security or whose server is seized—it can expose all your browser-based activity in that web tool without any signs of a change. To be maximally cautious, the most secure way to use end-to-end encrypted platforms is in desktop and mobile applications where you've already downloaded and installed the software that implements the encryption scheme, and that can only be altered by installing an update. Nextcloud and Cryptpad both offer stand-alone applications, while Proton has them for services like Mail and Calendar, but not Docs and Sheets.

Setting aside the entire privacy spectrum of cloud-hosted collaboration tools, there's also the old fashioned way: keeping a copy of files locally on your own computer. Collaborating within a small group on the draft of a truly secret document? Take turns editing it on one PC at a time with a text editor before passing it to the next editor over Signal.

For all these approaches, from the fully public to the paranoid, the same principle applies as in a Signal conversation: A piece of information is only as secure as the least secured device that accesses it. So as you consider your threat model and whose devices and accounts within your group have access to your most sensitive data, make sure they're appropriately locked down: That means full-disk encryption—here's a breakdown for Windows and Mac—strong passwords (we recommend a password manager), and multifactor authentication on all accounts for both cloud- and self-hosted services.

TLDR: A growing spectrum of collaboration approaches offer a range of options: from insecure-but-accessible Google Docs, to end-to-end encrypted or self-hosted tools like Proton and CryptPad, to storing and editing files locally and sharing them over Signal. Choose what works best for you based on your threat model.

If you're in the same region as people you're organizing with, does it make sense to bypass all of these digital gymnastics and just hang out? In many cases the answer is a resounding yes, experts told WIRED—but there are caveats here, too. First you should do the same threat model evaluation for in-person meetings that you did for your digital organizing: Is the association between you and the people you would be meeting already public? Or is it a secret that you know each other and work together? Carry out this same evaluation for the location where you would meet and anywhere else you would go together, just as you would for where and how you host sensitive data.

If you cannot be spotted together or be seen coming or going from a secret or sensitive location, meeting in person may not offer privacy benefits. You could be observed by bystanders, followed by law enforcement, or tracked via cell phone data, surveillance cameras, face recognition, automatic license plate readers, or any of the myriad ways that you can be surveilled in the physical world.

Just as with your threat model assessment for your data, there are no doubt plenty of situations where your affiliation is already public or non-sensitive—meeting people you know from your neighborhood, for example, or people you regularly volunteer with through a religious group, labor union, or other non-secret organization. If you can be seen together without giving away anything sensitive, experts emphasize that in-person meeting is one of the most valuable and potentially secure ways to collaborate.

“The communication that people have together physically can never be replaced, and I champion it,” Freedom of the Press Foundation's Holmes says. “I would like to say that the best encryption is the noisy bar where you're whispering to somebody. But we always do have to think about surveillance architecture, which is incredibly prevalent.”

TLDR: Meeting in person eliminates many technical vulnerabilities that could compromise your organization's privacy and security. But consider your threat model: If the very fact of your meeting needs to stay a secret, physical surveillance can make in-person meetings just as–or even more—risky than digital communications.

The truth, says Distribute Aid's Taylor Fairbank, is that all organizing that runs counter to the interests of the powerful, digital or physical, carries a threat of surveillance and its consequences. “There's always going to be some inherent risk to helping other people, unfortunately,” says Fairbank. “That's the reality that we live in, so think about what you're doing. Build your own threat model. And if you're not willing to accept the inherent risks of doing something, then don't do it.”

But Fairbank also says that those considerations shouldn't prevent people from acting. “Look at the risk in context, make informed choices, try to be as safe as possible,” says Fairbank. “But, my God, go out there and help people. Because we need it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This AI Tool Will Tell You to Stop Slacking Off","https://www.wired.com/story/fomi-ai-will-tell-you-to-stop-slacking-off/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

I've tested a lot of software tools over the years designed to block distractions and keep you focused. None of them work perfectly, mostly because of context.

Reddit, for example, is something I should generally avoid during the workday, so I tend to block it—this is a good decision for me overall. The problem is that sometimes the only place I can find a particular piece of information online is in a Reddit thread, meaning that to get that information I need to turn off my distraction-blocking tool. Then I inevitably end up down some kind of rabbit hole.

This is the exact problem Fomi, a macOS distraction-blocking tool, is built to solve. The application asks you what you're working on, then watches everything you do on your Mac desktop—every app you open—and uses AI to analyze what's on your screen. The tool can tell, from context, whether you're using a particular website productively or as a distraction.

Zach Yang, part of the team behind the app, tells me on Discord he dreamed up the app after talking with a friend who was studying for an MBA. “He needed YouTube for study videos, so web/app blockers didn't work, and once he was watching, recommendations would often pull him away,” Yang says. “That's when I started thinking about using AI to solve this. I built a small prototype to test whether current models were capable of distinguishing distraction from actual work, and the results were good enough that I decided to turn it into a real project.”

Fomi offers a three-day free trial. If you decide you like it, subscription plans cost $8 per month. However, since the tool uploads screenshots of your desktop to an AI model in the cloud, there are privacy concerns you will need to weigh before deciding if a tool like this is right for you.

I've been trying out this application for a couple of days. The first time you launch it, you're asked what you do day-to-day and what kind of tools you use to do it. Then, when it's time to focus, you tell the software what you're working on and which tools you plan to use while doing it.

As you work, a green dot and a timer appear at the top of the screen, surrounding your MacBook's notch. If you switch to a potentially distracting application, the dot changes to yellow. If you start engaging in things that are clearly distractions, the dot turns red and an animated tomato splats across the screen. You'll see a custom message telling you to get to work—the app calls out your specific distraction.

This worked surprisingly well for me while testing. If I'm reading an article relevant to the topic I'm writing about, the application will leave me alone. If I read an article about something else, though, I'm warned to stop—even if that article is on the same site as the relevant one. The same goes if I look at Reddit posts, or even YouTube videos. There were a few false positives, granted, but I could always click the False Alert button and get back to it.

“Defining what counts as ‘work' versus ‘distraction' is pretty nuanced,” Yang says. “For example, a content creator might be browsing Instagram for inspiration, which can be legitimate work, but the same behavior can also be pure leisure.”

You can avoid some of these problems by being very specific while describing your occupation and tasks. Yang says his team is constantly working on improving this recognition engine.

You might legitimately worry about the privacy implications of something like this. The application regularly takes screenshots of your currently open window and sends it to an online AI model—OpenAI's GPT 5 Mini—for processing. Some users will find it concerning that their private and potentially sensitive data is being uploaded to a cloud service. Yang tells me the Fomi team has taken steps to address this.

“Before anything leaves your machine, we run a local computer-vision pass to detect and redact personally identifiable information (things like names, phone numbers, emails, passwords, or card numbers),” he says. “Only the redacted image is sent to an AI model for one-time analysis.”

Yang says his company doesn't store any information in its own servers and that screenshots are stored only in RAM. He also says the app is distributed through the App Store, and not a direct download, in part to reassure customers that the application meets Apple's privacy standards.

Still, the amount of data sent to the AI model is considerable. In my tests, the application uploaded around half a gigabyte of files during the course of a regular workday, which is a lot of screenshots. This application isn't something you should use if your job requires secrecy.

None of which is to say I didn't find Fomi useful. I really enjoyed having a robot yell at me when I ended up slipping into distraction. I don't know if I'll use it forever, but it might help me build better habits while I do.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Why Distinguishing Trade Secrets From Public Knowledge Matters","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/why-distinguishing-trade-secrets-from-public-knowledge-matters-180178.html","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 13:03:20 GMT","

As companies deploy AI-driven platforms, analytics systems, and data-powered services, much of their competitive advantage now lives in internal documentation, deployment methods, proprietary workflows, and institutional know-how — not just patents or source code.

Trade secret protection is often assumed to safeguard that advantage. In practice, however, many technology organizations struggle to clearly distinguish between what is truly proprietary and what reflects common industry practice. When that distinction breaks down, even sophisticated products and extensive documentation may fail to qualify as legally protectable trade secrets.

While courts consider multiple factors when evaluating trade secrets, one requirement is often overlooked. Whenever a company seeks trade secret protection, it must clearly define what distinguishes its trade secrets from publicly known information.

Generally, the question is what distinguishes your trade secrets from common industry practice. Failing to do so can significantly weaken a company's position in court. For a company or individual defending against trade secret theft allegations, forcing the suing company to identify how its trade secrets differ from general industry knowledge can be a powerful defense.

One recent dispute involving a predictive analytics platform illustrates how this issue plays out in practice.

In a dispute between APT (acquired by MasterCard) and MarketDial (Applied Predictive Technologies Inc. v. MarketDial, Fed. Cir. Jan. 28, 2026), APT alleged that two consultants who had access to APT's materials later founded MarketDial, a direct competitor, prompting APT to file a trade secret misappropriation lawsuit.

APT built and licensed a predictive analytics platform, Test & Learn (T&L), for retailers and large enterprises. The company cited its Standard Deployment Guide (SDG), Partner Capabilities Briefing (PCB), and customized data feeds within T&L as alleged trade secrets.

APT lost the case because the court faulted APT for failing to move from high‑level labels (“SDG”, “PCB”, “custom data feeds”) to a precise articulation of what within those assets was truly secret and not readily ascertainable by others.

For example, APT did not isolate specific algorithms, workflows, parameterizations, or configurations that it claimed as trade secrets. APT also asserted that the “compilation” of features and processes in its materials was secret.

However, the court found that APT never identified which specific details in its materials constituted the actual secrets and were distinguishable from public knowledge. The court commented at the hearing that it should not have to wade through hundreds of pages of documents or a 70-page slide deck to determine the alleged trade secrets.

Despite having sophisticated software and extensive documentation, the APT dispute offers a clear warning: If you can't articulate precisely what in your product, documentation, or data architecture is non‑obvious and non‑public, your “secret sauce” may not be legally protectable when it matters most.

Generally speaking, “our deployment methodology” or “our data model” is not a defensible trade‑secret definition. Some courts permit a business, at the outset of a case and throughout discovery, to rely on such broad definitions. However, by the time a party reaches summary judgment (and the latter stages of a case), the business must specify how its trade secrets are distinguishable from what is publicly known.

In California, you will generally have to provide that level of specificity from the outset of the case, or the court will dismiss the case.

For technology leaders, trade secrets are no longer merely a legal designation — they define your competitive advantage but only when their boundaries are clearly understood and protected. Technology leaders need to enact operational discipline and create internal documentation to capture analytics workflows, AI models, and deployment processes.

The APT dispute demonstrates that sophisticated technology alone is insufficient. Companies that cannot precisely define what makes their systems non-public and non-obvious risk losing protection when disputes arise. Aligning technical documentation, governance practices, and security controls around those definitions is now essential for protecting modern technology businesses.

A large house overlooking Meydenbauer Bay in Bellevue, Wash., could be the home of the Seattle-region's next big AI startup. At the very least, it's a place where ideas are being hatched by tech founders who are inspired by living and working with one another.

Bili House is a hacker house started by a group of young people interested in improving connections and opportunities in the Seattle-area startup community.

The 7,000-square-foot waterfront house, complete with swimming pool and boat dock, features five bedrooms and co-working space. It's already serving as a gathering space for events and workshops for such things as learning to vibe code. And applications are open for a first cohort of four to six teams.

The house was launched by four founders: Sylviane Zhao, who recently graduated from Cornell University, and Shawn Yang and Tehani Cabour, who both worked at French software giant Dassault Systèmes. They're working together on projects including CodeChimp, a project management platform that aims to turn vibe coding into a “multiplayer experience” by using multi-agent orchestration and other AI-powered tools. Last fall they were part of a Plug and Play cohort in Seattle. Jatin Kumar is the fourth founding member and a Z Fellow.

“We're just trying to get the early stage startup scene kick started here in Bellevue,” Yang told GeekWire.

“Every morning you wake up, you just go upstairs from your room and start working with each other,” Zhao added. “Everything is 24/7, and it's very accessible.”

Yang said that before starting the hacker house, they were considering a move to San Francisco. He joked that the money they're paying for the house in Bellevue would get them a two-bedroom apartment in the Bay Area.

“I was living in San Francisco back in 2022-23 and I established rooms in different hacker houses. That really changed my perspective,” Yang said, adding that he feels like there are more startup “doers” than just “talkers” choosing to live and work this way.

The hacker house idea is not a new concept, especially in Silicon Valley where communal living for the tech-inclined has long been a way to incubate the next big thing. And it's been tried in the Seattle area. Tech veteran Andy Rebele (Pure Watercraft) ran a few different spaces more than a decade ago, including on Capitol Hill and in the University District. 

Seattle startup Tune also ran a house in 2015 near the University of Washington for women studying computer science. The desire for houses geared specifically toward female entrepreneurs continues today with FoundHer House, a San Francisco-based space spotlighted by The New York Times last year. Seattle is on the radar for potential expansion.

The Bili House website says rent ranges from $500 to $2,000 per month depending on room size. Amenities include utilities, high-speed internet, access to all common spaces, and community events. A minimum stay is three months.

In addition to events such as demo nights, founder dinners, and hackathons, the group is looking into partnerships, perhaps with a venture capital firm that could help defer some costs for startup founders. Bili House is also running a marketplace to connect renters to hacker spaces in other cities.

Other AI startups currently working out of Bili House include legal simulation platform LexSims and construction cost analysis company Bevr.

“I really just enjoy the culture,” Yang said. “I think it's nice to have people building alongside you, and to be able to share experiences, as well as skill sets, especially in today's age. It really helps to stay connected in the community, to encourage each other.”

After mentioning parking can be a bit of a constraint at the location, Yang offered up a hack for commuting to or from Bili House.

“University of Washington is 10 minutes by boat. Driving is like 30 or 40,” he laughed.

Seattle startup Adronite raised $5 million in a Series A round led by Gatemore Capital Management, as it looks to expand its AI-powered platform designed to give large organizations visibility into sprawling and complex codebases.

The funding comes amid intense competition in the AI developer tools market. Unlike many AI coding tools that operate at the level of individual files or snippets, Adronite ingests complete codebases, including both modern and legacy systems.

The idea is to help organizations understand how their software works as a system, with applications in security analysis, modernization, and active remediation at scale.

Adronite can also build apps from natural language prompts and offers an AI chat feature that provides details on system-wide insights. 

The system supports more than 20 programming languages and has been proven on a codebase with 2.5 million lines of code.

The 15-person company expects initial commercial deployments to begin in the first quarter of 2026.

There are various companies that offer code review tools, including CAST and Sonar. Adronite says its software differentiates in part due to its private network settings, as it can run entirely inside a secured internal environment.

Adronite co-founder and CEO Edward Rothschild is a former software engineer at Facebook and director of engineering at Nayya. He helped launch Adronite in 2023.

As part of the funding round, Liad Meidar, managing partner of Gatemore, was named chair of Adronite's board. Gatemore has offices in New York and London.

OpenAI is nearing a deal to raise more than $100 billion at a valuation that could exceed $850 billion, Bloomberg reports, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

The deal comes as the ChatGPT-maker burns through cash as it inches toward profitability. To that end, OpenAI has said it has started testing ads in ChatGPT for free users, a gamble that could lead to more revenue or could send users running from the platform. 

Apparently investors think it's worth the risk if they're valuing the company $20 billion higher than the $830 billion valuation initially expected. The company's pre-money value will remain at $730 billion, per Bloomberg's source. 

The first tranches of funding are reportedly coming from the usual suspects: Amazon (already in talks to invest up to $50 billion), SoftBank (gearing up for $30 billion), Nvidia (close to investing $20 billion), and Microsoft. VC firms and sovereign wealth funds are expected to close later, potentially bringing the total amount raised higher.

TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.

Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairperson of Indian conglomerate Reliance, on Thursday unveiled the group's ₹10 trillion (about $110 billion) plan to build AI computing infrastructure in India over the next seven years.

Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, Ambani said the investment would fund gigawatt-scale data centers, a nationwide edge computing network, and new AI services integrated with Reliance's Jio telecom platform.

Reliance has already begun construction of multi-gigawatt data centers in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Ambani said, and more than 120 megawatts of capacity is expected to come online in the second half of 2026.

Ambani's pledge adds to a growing wave of AI investment in India. Earlier this week, Adani Group outlined plans to invest about $100 billion to build AI data centers in the country, and the Indian government expects more than $200 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next two years. 

Global technology firms are also stepping up their presence, with OpenAI partnering with the Tata Group to develop about 100 megawatts of AI capacity in the country, and plans to scale that to 1 gigawatt eventually.

Ambani said the push is essential for India's technological self-reliance, saying the country “cannot afford to rent intelligence,” and that Reliance aims to cut the cost of AI services as dramatically as it once reduced mobile data prices in the country.

“The biggest constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination,” Ambani said. “It is scarcity and high cost of compute.”

The build-out, Ambani said, would be supported by Reliance's green energy capacity, which stretches to 10 gigawatts of surplus power from solar projects in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.

Reliance will partner with Indian enterprises, startups, and academic institutions to embed AI in industries ranging from manufacturing and logistics to agriculture, healthcare and financial services.

Jio has already been striking AI partnerships: it last year landed a deal with Google to offer free Gemini AI Pro access to millions of its users in India.

Reliance also plans to develop AI capabilities in several Indian languages to spur adoption of the tech, Ambani said.

The aggressive push highlights how India's largest conglomerates are racing to secure a foothold in what is expected to be one of the country's biggest technology opportunities.

OpenAI is partnering with Reliance to add AI-powered conversational search to the Indian conglomerate's streaming service JioHotstar. 

The feature, which is powered by OpenAI's API, will let users search for movies, shows, and live sports using text and voice prompts in multiple languages, and receive recommendations based on their preferences and history.

OpenAI has recently expanded its footprint in India, which is home to more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users. The company plans to open offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its current office in New Delhi.

The partnership was announced at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where Sam Altman is appearing alongside industry leaders, including Anthropic's Dario Amodei and Google's Sundar Pichai.

The companies also plan to extend the partnership to surface JioHotstar recommendations directly within ChatGPT, allowing users who search for entertainment through ChatGPT to receive contextual suggestions and deep links into the platform's catalogue. The move positions the integration as a two-way discovery layer rather than a standalone in-app feature.

The move comes as streaming and TV platforms increasingly experiment with conversational interfaces. Netflix said in May 2025 it was testing a new search experience using OpenAI's ChatGPT to help viewers find content through natural language, while Google in November introduced Gemini-powered discovery features for its Google TV platform.

Fidji Simo, chief executive of applications at OpenAI, said the partnership is aimed at bringing more personalized AI experiences into entertainment and live sports, enabling viewers to move “from curiosity to context” through natural interactions.

Embedding AI into content discovery will help reshape how audiences find and engage with programming, said Uday Shankar, vice chairperson of JioStar.

The rollout will span both live and on-demand formats, the companies said.

The JioHotstar partnership is part of OpenAI's broader “OpenAI for India” push to deepen its presence in the South Asian nation through infrastructure, enterprise, and education partnerships. Other moves under the initiative include collaborations with the Tata Group on AI-ready data centers and enterprise deployments, as well as agreements with Indian companies such as Pine Labs, Eternal, and MakeMyTrip.

Tech investors haven't given up on the dream of making physical products with the same speed and ease as coding software. 

Executives at Freeform, a startup developing a novel 3D printing system for metal components, told TechCrunch that the company raised a $67 million Series B to expand its manufacturing platform. 

Investors include Apandion, AE Ventures, Founders Fund, Linse Capital, NVidia's NVentures , Threshold Ventures, and Two Sigma Ventures. FreeForm declined to disclose the company's post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.

CEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. 

That's the culmination of a vision Palitsch launched in 2018 after developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. 

Their new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform's platform is “AI native,” noting a partnership with Nvidia that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.

“I think we're the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We're running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”

The data collected by sensors in the company's manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity. 

“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said. 

While Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers. Now, the company wants to hire as many as 100 new employees and expand its facility to start executing on its contract backlog. 

Manufacturing-as-a-service has grown as a category as venture investors have taken a greater interest in building vehicles, robots, and energy production systems. For example, Hadrian recently earned a $1.6B valuation from its investors while developing automated production for defense, and VulcanForms and Divergent have raised hundreds of millions to develop metal-printing services of their own.

This piece has been updated to reflect former president Thomas Ronacher's departure from Freeform.

OpenAI has partnered with India's Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company's enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. 

OpenAI announced on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its Stargate project, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services' HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata's workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI's tools.

The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company's expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI's most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.

The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI's access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.

An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI's long-term ambitions in India.

Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata's businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI's Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.

N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI's partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country's workforce for the AI era.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.

In November 2025, TCS secured backing from private equity firm TPG to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.

OpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI's recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions in engineering, medicine, and design.

OpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its existing presence in New Delhi as it deepens operations in the country. The expansion is expected to support enterprise partnerships, developer engagement, and local regulatory coordination as the company scales its footprint in India.

The announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI leaders, including Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are participating alongside Indian startups and enterprises showcasing AI applications across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.

OpenAI has been expanding its presence in India through partnerships with companies including Pine Labs, JioHotstar, Eternal, Cars24, HCLTech, PhonePe, CRED, and MakeMyTrip, as it seeks to embed its models across consumer platforms, enterprise systems and digital payments infrastructure in one of the world's largest internet markets.

Together, the data center build-out, enterprise deployments, and expanding partner ecosystem signal OpenAI's most comprehensive push yet to anchor advanced AI infrastructure and applications in India.

As India pitches itself as a global hub for applied artificial intelligence, OpenAI has partnered with Pine Labs to integrate AI-driven reasoning into the fintech firm's payments stack, automating settlement and invoicing workflows in a move the companies say could help accelerate AI-led commerce in India.

The partnership will see Pine Labs embed OpenAI's application programming interfaces — software tools that let companies plug AI into their existing systems — within its payments and commerce infrastructure, the companies said on Thursday, all with the aim of enabling AI-assisted settlement, reconciliation, and invoicing workflows.

The deal underscores OpenAI's broader push to expand its footprint in India, one of its fastest-growing markets, as it looks to move beyond being known primarily as the maker of ChatGPT and embed its technology into education, enterprise, and infrastructure. Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to bring AI tools into higher education, betting that India's large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.

Pine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.

For Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.

“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that's where adoption can happen faster.”

The rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.

For OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India's payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs' role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.

Pine Labs says it works with more than 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.

Rau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI's tools. “We've kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.

The arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI's partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.

Rau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.

Pine Labs' interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. Separately, India also began piloting consumer payments directly through AI chatbots last year.

The new announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are showcasing their latest capabilities alongside Indian startups demonstrating AI applications aimed at large-scale deployment across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.

Microsoft was unique among the companies I worked for in that they gave you some guidelines and then let you blog without having  to go through some approval or editing process.  It made blogging much more personal and organic IMO; company-curated blog posts read like marketing.I didn't see the original post but it looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed.I care much less about whether the person exercised good judgment in posting, and don't care (and am happy) that there was not some process that would have caught it pre-publication.I care much more if the person works in a team that believes that copyright infringement for AI training is a justifiable behavior in a corporate environment.And now we know that is a thing, and I suspect that there will be some hard questions asked by lawyers inside the company, and perhaps by lawyers outside the company.

Why do you assume that reviewing docs is a lower bar than reviewing code, and that if docs aren't being reviewed it's somehow less likely that code is being reviewed?There's a formal process for reviewing code because bugs can break things in massive ways. While there may not be the same degree of rigor for reviewing documentation because it's not going to stop the software from working.But one doesn't necessarily say anything about the other.

What I'm saying is, you have to review code to get it out the door with a certain degree of quality. That's your core product. That's the minimum standard you have to pass, the lowest bar.In contrast, reviewing documentation is usually less core. You do that after the code gets reviewed. If there's time. If it doesn't get done, that's not necessarily saying anything about code quality.Even if it's easier to review documentation, that doesn't mean it's getting prioritized. So it's not a lower bar in the sense that lower bars get climbed first.

If anything Kaggle would be on the hook for including the data as CC0. Or perhaps to Shubham Maindola for uploading it. In fact the ""provenance"" listed would give me chills. Crazy how this got a 10.0 score. ""I downloaded the ebooks of Harry Potter. Then converted them to txt files.""

[1]https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throw_the_book_atNow, as for ""the rest of us are prosecuted as harshly as possible if caught"". You are correct in your pedantry that this statement not expressed as rigorously as it possibly could have been. There are different classes of copyright infringement; ""receiving"" and ""perpetuating""  being two of them [to avoid further pedantry, I am not asserting this is precise legal terminology but rather a lay distinction for the purposes of discussion]. It is the latter case which is tried as harshly as possible when caught, and there are many such examples other than Swartz, and I think it was clear my intent when I said it despite the fact that I did not write about the distinction at length.That is not to say the situation around the former type of copyright infringement is so kind, either. While in some countries it is mostly overlooked, which I believe to be the case in the US, in other countries it is more strictly enforced, such being the case in my own country. While ""as harshly as possible"" isn't accurate to prosecution against infringement of this nature, you can still be disproportionately punished relative to the damage caused when downloading pirated material for personal viewing, if caught (and ISPs/rightsholders do monitor for it to the best of their abilities).There is also a third class of copyright infringement to consider which is highly disfavourable to individuals: derivative works. Strictly speaking, even as something as simple as drawing fanart of a character or remixing a song is illegal, even if the activity is completely non-commercial in nature. This is, of course, absolutely ridiculous. Rightsholders know that copyright law reformation would gain tremendous popular support if they were draconian about enforcing their rights against derivative works, and that allowing fan communities to bloom is actually beneficial to their own IP, so enforcement is highly selective. However, that arbitrary, selective nature of enforcement is itself dangerous to individuals, and is sometimes used to punish specific individuals as harshly as possible at the whims of the IP holder. It is true that not everyone is actually subjected to this, but the threat of it happening looms over everyone who expresses their creativity through derivative works.None of this sits right with me, especially as corporations are hoovering up every piece of copyrighted material they possibly can and creating commercial derivative-work-machines that mass-produce sloppified derivative works, and are getting a completely free pass by the legal system to do so while individuals are still treated like felons for 'crimes' that are at most marginally harmful, or in the case of the creative production of derivative works, not only not harmful but actually beneficial to society.

But ignoring that: I do not think that these txt files being online do any economic harm.

If at all the kaggle dataset is free publicity. So as the author I would leave them online.

The implicit motto of this class of hyper-wealthy people is: ""it's not yours if you cannot keep it"". Well, game on.(There are 56.5e6 millionaires, and 3e3 billionaires -- making them 0.7% of the global population. They are outnumbered 141.6 to 1. And they seem to reside and physically congregate in a handful of places around the world. They probably wouldn't even notice that their property is being stolen, and even if they did, a simple cycle of theft and recovery would probably drive them into debt).

If it comes from a site claiming it was under a licence when it was not, the misdeed is done by the person who provided the version carrying the licence.

Even if MS could claim that they were acting in good faith there really isn't much legal wiggle room for that. But it doesn't even come to that because I don't think anyone would buy that they really thought that the Harry Potter books were under the CC0

reply

Same thing applies here.Up to 80% off all works that are in copyright terms are accidentally in the public domain. A well known example is Night of the Living Dead. It is not your job to check that the copiright on a work you use is the correct one.

Why exactly?

reply

A search index might also contain copyrighted material. As long as it's used for search queries as opposed to regurgitation there's no problem. Search indexes and LLMs are both clearly very beneficial tools to have access to.

reply

reply

Since we're talking about an electronic system the search index example is the more directly relevant one. Anyone who wants to object to LLMs is going to need to take care to ensure consistency with his views on Google's search index.

reply

Also can you point out how copyright law changes because we're using an ""electronic system"" as opposed to an ""analog system?""

reply

I never claimed any change in copyright law. Only that one analogy was more direct than the other for the purpose of the current discussion.You didn't answer my question. What point were you trying to make with your earlier reply?

In general when selecting articles we assume that the reader is an expert in some field(s), but not necessarily in the field covered by this article. As such, things which are simple for an expert in the specific domain, can still be surprisingly to learn for folks who aren't experts in that domain.What I'm saying is, that we don't try to be a cutting edge scientific journal — rather than that, we publish even the smallest trick that we decide someone may not know about and find it fun/interesting to learn.The consequence of that is that, yeah, some article have a bit clickbaity titles for some of the readers.On the flip side, as we know from meme-t-shirts, there are only 2 things hard in computer science, and naming is first on the list ;)P.S.

I know very little about robotics, but given these appear totally free-standing, if that was the case (I personally don't think it is), wouldn't that imply they have the same centre of gravity and weight of limbs as humans? Surely they'd have to be able to balance themselves, and copying a human's movements ""exactly"" wouldn't work for their own motion otherwise?I think when watching I saw one or two of the robots ""judder"" their feet a bit out of sync with others - this seems to imply they are capable of balancing their own motion a bit individually.

These robots are certainly running through a scripted set of poses which has been extensively tested for the conditions (Humans would also be choreographed and have to hit certain marks at certain times). If you covered the stage in loose gravel or a thick carpet they'd all start falling over. The things the robots hold are almost certainly taped into their hands.Despite that, this is a very impressive demo. Those robots are $40k+, they've got 20+ of them. And not a single one fell over. They're fast too - and there are a load of corners they could have cut, but they didn't.The floor has two textures, it would have been easier without that. The humans right alongside them? Much less safety paperwork without them. The robot wearing trousers and a cape? Much easier without that. The fewer robots you have, the lower the chances on falls over landing their backflip. Lose the audience and record it in multiple takes. Hell, you could have human acrobats in robot costumes and it'd cost far less and be much easier.So this demo is very much a costly signal of confidence.

You can clearly see that the robots change their grip of their sword, so it cannot be taped to their hands.

With the poles at the 1 minute mark, the robots enter holding them and their left hand never moves on the pole. Also note the stationary hand is matte grey while the moving hand is metallic silver.Likewise with the wine gourds (?) at 2m30s and the nunchucks at 3m40s.It's a completely sensible design decision, much simpler to do cartwheels and vaults if you don't have super delicate fingers fitted.

The motion is certainly scripted, but the exact mechanics in play there almost certainly vary radically from take to take. Imagine something simple like a pool/billiards break. Even if you set up a machine to rack the balls and break them in as close to identical as possible, you'd get wildly different results each time. And the dynamics in this motion is going to dwarf that.[1] - https://youtu.be/mUmlv814aJo?t=168

This would also be normal for human performers - touring ballet companies travel with their own flooring the dancers are used to pirouetting on.At the 40 second mark every robot does a backflip then when landing hops their supporting leg while pointing the toe of their working leg. Which works fine and looks great! But they arrive in that pose with a certain amount of momentum and needing a certain amount of grip on the floor.So this is a rehearsed, tested performance - not proof we'll have firefighter robots doing parkour through burning buildings any time soon!

An Aldebaran Nao can fall over with no damage because it's only 5kg and 58cm. And you can use relatively low power motors, so nobody can lose a finger to crushing in the joints.But you miss out on the benefits of being able to operate in a human centric world - you'll never get a Nao to climb stairs, open a door, or carry a cup of coffee.

Human individual fingers can withstand internal loads of hundreds of newtons, (possibly a thousand for brief periods if you're a star rock-climber), while at the same being capable of tasks such as writing, which require high speeds and (sub-)millimeter precision, while also enjoying 4 degrees of freedom (5 for the thumb), and they're stuffed full of sensory organs to boot. Oh and they're also self-healing, so taking some damage during use is no problem and they will actually adapt to the task they're used for over time. Everything we can make compared to this is laughably primitive.If you make an agile robot big, it now weighs more, which means its joints now need to handle greater loads, which makes it necessary to make them much bulkier and heavier.A lot of this is just inherent limitations of electric motors and having to convert rotational energy. This gets heavy fast.Decent synthetic electrically-driven muscle fibers would go a long way.

The fact that Unitree's robots appear so acrobatic reflects that they are likely on par with BD in terms of capabilities but have a different target market.

We are definitely on an exponential in term of capabilities of humanoid robots.
We are probably only years away from having a robot in the house, in construction of robots. Automating anything that a human can do is best done in a human sized robot.But.None of these are actually useful right now. I don't want something with the arm strength of a forklift taking care of my parents or kids. The demand for humanoid robots right now is like lift a fridge from a delivery truck to a house (aka more mobile forklift) or walk through toxic sewage to pull crates out. Super useful but basically just mobile cranes, which is a small market. China seems to be making the mistake of pushing a tech demo as a consumer product (we've all been on those projects...) which can make people hate the tech.Build something people want, don't mandate what they want. We're like 3-4 generations from amazing, useful robots. I'll be scared when these things are minding a bunch of dogs on stage.

They could be really useful: without hesitation such humanoid could bring pack of explosives to the opposed treeline.

Also, current tech could be useful as a shopping assistant, to carry the groceries for people who can't, for one reason or another. Though the other post about tipping safety does have a point.

reply

Robots in such an environment are designed with the appropriate affordances so that they cannot use too much force... but the concern about weight I suppose is quite salient.

reply

A risk I never hear discussed is falling over and injuring children. Even the petite Unitree models are like a 70kg piece of furniture. Each year thousands get injured because of furniture falling over. I'd buy one immediately, but if I had kids or pets, I would wait for safety data on falls.

You had to use a few trick for larger programs, but basically it managed to type any real programs and I never encountered an ambihuous case that caused a problem in practice. In case of failure, the small set of unsatisfiable constraints was easy to translate into nice error messages. This also allows for typing rules that are easy to state and can accomodate operators that adapts nicely to their environment.I would understand if this approach would be frowned upon, but I still wonder if any serious language ever used this approach?

2) Any semblance of American technological superiority is pure fantasy at this point. The only area where Americans are truly ""advanced"" is in selling overpriced SaaS products. There are dozens of Chinese startups with robots just like this—as seen at CES—yet Boston Dynamics is still treated like it's some untouchable, DARPA-level tech.3) A lot of this comes down to cost: you can either hire one American fresh grad or a Chinese PhD for the same price.3) The second reason is cultural: Americans tend to buy solutions, while the Chinese prefer to build them. Even SMEs in China maintain internal dev teams to build custom software for the business, as opposed to paying Salesforce for what is essentially a glorified Excel sheet with sprinkles of automation.4)  America is facing its own innovator's dilemma.

Perhaps we're one step beyond the innovators dilemma.

The American ""free"" (lol) market is being guarded by politicians but that won't work for long.

Money should be a means to achieve a thing, not the goal in and of itself. I think the most visible decline came with the increasingly overt goal to charge rent on friggin everything. That's simply not a sustainable or realistic economic model for society and consequently even if it might maximize corporate income in the short to mid-term, in the longterm it's equally catastrophic for them as well.

Once China built an industrial base, and has cheap energy sources, you cannot directly out compete it. You can only try to maintain your own industrial base by locking competitors out of your market. There is no other way. In the end that's the result of globalization - US&EU companies thought they can produce cheap, sell expensive. Instead they trained their own competition, and due to weak IP laws enabled this exodus of industry know-how to China.Now, if China was a smaller country - let's say Japan or Turkey - this wouldn't be such a huge problem. 
But for the global economy, having a single country that produces 80% of all consumer goods is also a huge problem. That was never the case before with the US (except maybe directly after WW2). US+Europe, Japan+Korea, Canada, Australia supply chain was much more diverse and distributed.What happens now is dangerous because in the end the profits are not spread across the world, and economies of scale cause this monopoly to appear, which will be hard to mitigate.Can countries ""slow"" down China and move production to diversified locations? For that to work, coordinated tariffs for advanced goods from China would have to be introduced, and production reallocated to multiple other countries - very difficult to execute..

> It's clear, people want to be addicted to social mediaI'd say people are susceptible to addiction rather than wanting it. Suppliers of any addictive product - whether its tobacco, class A drugs, alcohol, gambling or social media - know that.   Going too hard the other way into full prohibition is impractical because it starts to impinge on civil liberties: as a  capable adult, why shouldn't I be able to smoke/drink/doomscroll instagram if I want?That's why it's dificult; neither extreme liberty nor extreme prohibition is the answer.  It's a grey area as GP notes.  The trouble is it creates opportunities for people like Zuckerberg to exploit the middle ground and amass huge personal wealth paid for, in part, by the health detriment of those unable to self-regulate the addiction.

In reality we are not so much in control, our psyche is easily manipulated by nudges, design that leaves you on the cusp of a dopaminic reaction is much more addictive. It's different to develop a vice to being manipulated into developing a vice. Morality should come into play on the latter, otherwise it's a free-for-all to discover the most effective ways to manipulate you into behaviours that are unhealthy but profitable.

Takes some minimal effort to be honest to tell the kid no and give them other outlets for their boredom. I never did tablets or small screens at all. Parenting today, and last decade or so, instead puts infants in front of tablets. Its insane. All media is then altered to steal attention and maximize engagement. It's to be expected. Zuck is basically cocomelon. Garbage that people love to eat.Oh and we did ban cocomelon. My kids watch plenty of Tv and I'm not going to rave about it, it's crappy kid TV, we try to push some educational stuff too. But It was obvious that when cocomelon was on kids eyes glaze over, they forget to blink, they have no idea what is going on around them, and just look like zombies staring at a TV/screen. Let's be honest though, that's what most parents like about it.

It can be in the company's interest to act for the good of society and a CEO can claim that it is his fudiciary duty to act in the interest of society.But when society's interests are in direct conflict with the interests of the company you cannot expect a CEO to act in the interest of society.Even if a CEO is perfectly within their rights to act against the interests of the company, it doesn't change the fact that investors might replace him if the CEO does so consistently.

What do you expect to happen in such a system?

reply

Regulation is not done with the purpose of preventing companies from profits. It is done because companies cannot be expected to act in society's best interest, so society has to make demands of companies, ie regulation.

reply

Do you realize how insane this sounds?

reply

If a CEO consistently passes up large profits to protect society then investors will attempt to put a new CEO in charge.

Tech-specific (more like Careless People):- Empire of AI: tells the story of how the massive AI labs started and became as big as they are with a focus on OpenAI, provides new insight into the coup that outed Altman a couple years ago- Number Go Up: digs into the crypto culture and scams with novel insight into Tether- Bad Blood: a classic about Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes and how far a technologically impossible startup can go- Super Pumped: about Uber and the dirty tactics they employed to stay ahead, also touches on the toxic culture that was propagated there- Money Men: about the criminal enterprise around Wirecard, hard to keep up with at times due to the focus on the FT investigation rather than the fraud but interesting anywayFinance-focused:- Barbarians at the Gate: a classic about the attempted takeover of RJR Nabisco (oreos and tobacco) by management and early PE firms, told from first hand accounts- Too Big Too Fail: similar in form to Barbarians but instead focused on the 08 collapse and the attempts by the government to save all the irresponsible banks, told in too much of a sympathetic way for me but interesting to see how things happened behind the scenes- All the Devils Are Here: on the other hand a very unsympathetic look into the 08 crisis, by the same authors as Smartest Guys in the RoomOther:- The Smartest Guys in the Room: my favourite of them all, tells the story of Enron and their rise and incredible fall, basically a foundational text on how to do a financial crime (and not get away with it)- Chip War: very relevant look into the production of computer chips, highlights the reliance on only a few companies and the incredible costs involved- Empire of Pain: also a favourite, goes into the Sackler family and how they built Perdue Pharma and then proceeded to cause the devastating opioid epidemic- The Power Broker: a classic about Robert Moses who basically built half of New York at the expense of marginalised residents, it's very long so I'd recommend reading/listening along with the 99% invisible breakdownI've not read Character Limit so have added that to my ""To Read"" pile!

Social media offers many more benefits than alcohol does, and it could certainly be banned for children.
Alcohol is almost certainly less beneficial and more harmful to its users than social media.You are correct that alcohol has been around for a while, but that hardly explains why it should be treated differently.

They're both unhealthy products and I feel they deserve to be just that. Allow social media to be what it wants. But also approach it with moderation and regulation around access. The wellness experts shouldn't be dictating what social media is, they should be promoting more healthy ways regarding how it's used. It's an uphill battle for a reason though, we like it too much.

There was a major public campaign in the 1950s to ban rock & roll music, and in the 1980s to ban heavy metal. In each case, there were legions of ""experts"" calling those genres ""harmful"", and they were taken seriously -- congressional hearings were held, etc.Point is, ""promoting a harmful product"" is very much in the eye of the beholder, and doesn't work as an objective moral standard.

The primary purpose of CPF is not a pension scheme. It is structured as a massive forced bond purchase scheme by citizens. Financially what happens is the 37% of citizen income buys a long term bond (till retirement age, on average decades) at rock bottom interest rates (it's pegged to the overnight rate or a minimum of 2.6%). The returns are specifically decoupled from the real long term returns. This has historical roots in the government needing vast capital financing. They make enormous amounts of the delta between the short term interest rate and long term capital gains. Singapore has no oil or natural resources, but it's sovereign wealth fund has AUM in the regions of countries like Norway which do for this reason. It is not a shock absorber like the article suggests. The withdrawal terms are strict - housing, a significant medical expense and retirement are the only real ways to get money out of it.""Trying to keep people employed"" is a goal, not a policy. In fact the Singapore government maintains a large worker supply through immigration. The foreign worker population, ~30%. The main goal of the government is to maximize the absolute number of people working.The reason it raising the retirement age is effective in workforce participation is because most people have no choice. Retirement only pays out after the age. The working life of an average Singaporean has seen 37% gone to CPF, maybe another 10% to income taxes, another 5% to GST, road tax, property tax, etc. After all this there's the astronomical cost of living. This is also intentional, to raise the number of employees.

The working life of an average Singaporean has seen 37% gone to CPF, maybe another 10% to income taxes, another 5% to GST, road tax, property tax, etc. After all this there's the astronomical cost of living. This is also intentional, to raise the number of employees.

It's essentially a forced loan to the government at subpar rates.  The ""tax"" is the delta between what the government pays out for the bonds vs what a bond of equivalent risk in the free market would have paid.The magnitude of the investment also probably makes it impractical for anyone but the very wealthy to retire before that starts paying out.  Most other countries have lower rates on their retirement schemes, which makes it feasible for more people to live on their savings for a few years before the government retirement scheme kicks in.  E.g. in the US it's pretty feasible for the upper middle/lower upper classes to retire a few years before Social Security kicks in, especially if they're willing to live frugally.

Actually, the justification is to prevent old people from having to work. Retirement didn't really exist until the creation of pension systems in the late 19th century, and the modern social security system was a poverty alleviation measure introduced in the 1930s. Hell, social security was initially resented by older workers because of the cover it gave employers for firing them for being too old.

Currently there are more payouts than taxes so the trust fund is being used to make up the difference.When the trust fund is depleted (barring any changes, this happens at some point in the next decade if I'm not mistaken) then there will be a reckoning.  If no action is taken by Congress the result is that payouts will be cut by the necessary percentage to match the taxes.

Yes, it does. The Obama administration explicitly appropriated general government funds to try and make up a developing shortfall in the 'fund'.

I get it to a certain extent, don't live in poverty if you don't have too, but I am a major saver. I rarely buy new things if an old thing is working fine. If I die early at least my family will will be set.Really the social safety nets in the US are basically non-existent so having a big savings buffer makes me feel a bit safer. Honestly dying early doesn't worry me too much, I'll be dead so doesn't bother me. What does worry me is the economy tanks and all my saving become worthless. Then I would have some regrets...

Yes the jobloss impact caused the people to be unable to save and in turn they wished they have saved more.. but ignored is whether they could to begin with.Of course external impact had little to do with internal procrastination.

It says that understanding risk (as operationalized by understanding probability) has a larger effect.But it is also saying that the more external impact someone has, the more they regret saving more -- in the United States but not Singapore.The study is explicitly saying that internal motivation does not seem to matter. And the article is arguing the reason why.

It's basically just saying that the uninsured catastrophic event risk in America magnifies shock events.E.g., if you have a major hospital visit in America you're way more likely to regret not saving enough, but in Singapore there's basically no effect since hospital stays don't drain your savings account.

Not just healthcare stuff, but also apparently Singaporeans tend to have a lower unemployment rate, so they be able to recover from stuff faster

It's similar in Vienna where only native Viennese are immediately eligible for social housing, but outsiders will end up paying into the system without being eligible.

reply

By definition, outsiders don't have to pay into the system since they already have a gov't somewhere else that is dedicated to them, just like the Viennese do.

They absolutely do pay into the system when they move to and work in Vienna. By outsiders in this context I meant foreign workers. I assumed that was clear from the context of the discussion.

Countries like Singapore and all of the Middle East meanwhile rely on a revolving door of cheap immigrant labor.  In the extreme cases like Qatar 95% of the working population are on short term visas. Most of these countries don't have a pathway to citizenship at all for this worker class. You could live there, work and pay taxes for 10 or 20 or 50 years, but the day you ""retire"" you need to pack up and leave.

Well, America is rough.

The very richest have correctly made a bet that uprisings to displace the wealthy and politicians just don't occur here these days, and therefore there is no real threat or need to change the way things have been going for the last 25 years or so.

Nature abhors a vacuum, and it seems the space that Epstein filled was large and branching and significantly profitable (in money, information, and influence). There's no way there isn't at least one other person that's started to fill the void.Ideally, the ramifications of association with Epstein should shrink the size of the vacuum considerably, but the pursuit of those associates has really only just started and, as someone else has already pointed out, some countries / governments are protecting these associates rather than investigating / prosecuting. As such, there's not much discouragement yet.

Fast, stealthy, and cheap—autonomous, semisubmersible drone boats carrying tons of cocaine could be international law enforcement's nightmare scenario. A big one just came ashore.

On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane's crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.

In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub's coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water's surface. They'd bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.

The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.

First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio's crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.

The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia's first confirmed uncrewed narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade's most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase. 

Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn't put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.

Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.

Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they're also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.

Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today's fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.

A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That's worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.

Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.

If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they're less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1 million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.

Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.

As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia's International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.

Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat's builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.

“If you don't have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It's one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it's another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That's a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.

An uncrewed sub doesn't have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.

Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute's journal Proceedings in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.

The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn't just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn't an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain's southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.

Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It's exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona's hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.

Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.

I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It's clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.

At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.

“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”

For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn't be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver's movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil's government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.

The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they're going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.

Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they're continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.

Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don't have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union's European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.

Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia's over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.

Even so, it's not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.

With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.” 

That's where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it's somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.

In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia's JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn't mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says. 

Analysts don't think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don't think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it's a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they're continuously one step ahead of authorities.”

There's still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they'll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.

Sickness and death are inevitable, but many of us will never get the chance to know exactly when our worst health ailments will strike. Someday soon, though, that might not be true for people with Alzheimer's disease, research out today shows.

Scientists say they've devised a model that can narrow down the onset of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. Based on simple blood test results, they were able to predict the age, within several years, that someone would develop symptoms. In the short term, this work could improve clinical trials for Alzheimer's, the researchers say, and down the road, it may help people at higher risk make crucial decisions about their future.

“Given the speed of progress in Alzheimer's research, blood biomarkers, and modeling, we are hopeful that these kinds of models will be available for clinical care within the next couple of years,” study author Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, told Gizmodo.

There have been important advances in Alzheimer's research lately, including diagnosis.

Though the foolproof test for Alzheimer's still relies on examining the brain after death, doctors now employ several methods to diagnose the condition in living people with high accuracy, even before symptoms like memory loss appear. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration formally approved the first blood tests for diagnosing or ruling out Alzheimer's, and still more are on the way.

These tests look for biomarkers closely linked to Alzheimer's, such as the proteins tau and amyloid beta. In Alzheimer's, abnormal versions of these proteins build up in the brain. One particular form of abnormal tau, called phosphorylated tau 217 (ptau217), seems to be an especially great biomarker. Since its levels in the blood track so closely with the progression of Alzheimer's, the WashU researchers believe that ptau217 can act as a clock to predict the visible onset of the disease.

To create their model, the researchers analyzed data from two existing Alzheimer's research projects, involving roughly 600 older people. These volunteers, who started out in good cognitive health, were given one of several blood tests measuring ptau217, including PrecivityAD2, a commercially available test developed by WashU researchers that's in the final steps of being reviewed for FDA approval.

“In our study, we found that blood p-tau217 levels increased relatively consistently across individuals, allowing us to estimate the age that individuals became positive on the p-tau217 test,” co-author Kellen Petersen, an instructor in neurology at WashU Medicine, told Gizmodo. “This age at p-tau217 positivity was strongly associated with the age that individuals developed symptoms of Alzheimer's.”

All in all, the team's model could predict when someone's p-tau217 levels would likely soon lead to visible symptoms, though within an average time window of three to four years. Notably, the gap between high p-tau217 levels and Alzheimer's symptoms was shorter in older volunteers, suggesting that younger people can better fend off brain deterioration. The team's model also worked with blood tests besides PrecivityAD2, indicating its potential wide usability. Their results were published Thursday in Nature Medicine.

Given the current time frame of three to four years, their clock model is best used in clinical trials for now, the researchers say. But that amount of advance notice could still provide valuable insights.

“Our models will help trials select individuals who are still cognitively unimpaired but more likely to develop symptoms during the clinical trial, which would make trials more efficient,” Petersen said.

The researchers are also optimistic that incorporating data from other blood, imaging, and cognitive tests can further refine their predictions. And eventually, these models should become accurate enough that doctors and patients can use them to guide their next steps.

“For example, individuals who are far from symptom onset might choose to focus on lifestyle modification, while those close to symptom onset might be more proactive and consider participating in clinical trials,” Petersen said. The researchers are already working to improve their models, and they've released their code online and created a web-based app so that other research teams can try to do the same.

Right now, Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia are incurable. But innovations like this could help us one day turn back the clock.

30 years ago, Doctor Who put a brief pause on its years of hiatus in style with the release of the TV movie, an attempt to revive the franchise for the then-modern age and American audiences. Although its legacy would endure in more ways off screen than on, the film itself has been a bit left by the wayside… until now.

Today the BBC announced it would celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 1996 film with a brand new Blu-ray and UHD release, remastering it in 4K from scans of its original film negatives and allowing fans to see the film like it's never been seen before, with a newly reconstructed surround sound soundtrack.

Guest-starring Sylvester McCoy as the seventh Doctor—and introducing Paul McGann as the eighth—the Doctor Who TV movie sees a newly regenerated Doctor race against time to stop the return of one of his oldest foes, the Master, after the renegade Time Lord escaped his seeming death at the hands of the Daleks. It introduced a new companion for the new Doctor, Dr. Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook), a new incarnation of the Master (played to camp perfection by Eric Roberts), and introduced Yee Jee Tso as Chang Lee, an unwitting agent of the Master as he planned revenge on the Doctor by stealing his future regenerations from him.

Although the TV movie failed to spark a new era for the series (it'd have to wait another 9 years for that to happen), it was a shot in the arm for the extended Doctor Who universe, giving the series a new leading hero to follow up with across comics, books, and especially on audio, with Paul McGann's Doctor essentially becoming the face of Big Finish's Doctor Who audio dramas for decades. In 2013, to mark Doctor Who‘s 50th anniversary, McGann briefly returned on-screen as the Eighth Doctor for a special mini-episode, “Night of the Doctor”, which remains his last prominent on-screen appearance as the Doctor outside of a few brief photographic cameos.

Doctor Who: The Movie releases on UHD and standard Blu-ray sometime this year, with pre-orders opening up soon ahead of a UK release in May. A US release date has yet to be confirmed.

Dark matter doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light. It's invisible but supposedly makes up 85% of the universe's mass. Because it's so abundant, astronomers believe it should explain many unsolved mysteries surrounding the cosmos, including an extraordinary dim galaxy “hiding” in plain sight.

Last summer, astronomers vetted candidates for so-called dark galaxies, or a rare class of galaxies with remarkably low surface brightness. The paper on the findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, surmised that so-called “dark galaxies” should have “some of the most extreme properties among all known galaxies.”

And today, NASA shared high-resolution images of one such galaxy, CDG-2. If the astronomers' hypothesis is correct, CDG-2 would be among the most heavily dark-matter-filled galaxies ever identified.

Again, dark matter doesn't interact with light. However, astronomers infer its presence from dark matter's gravitational influence on surrounding objects. Often, this refers to unseen mass that seems to be driving galaxies, planets, stars, and supernovas—you name it—to appear a certain way.

Simply put, if dark matter didn't exist, many of the models scientists use to understand the cosmos would break down. Although scientists have yet to directly detect dark matter, dissenters have also yet to find an alternative that explains things better. So the consensus, at least for now, is that dark matter exists.

7 Weird Space Phenomena That Only Make Sense if Dark Matter Exists

CDG-2 lies within the Perseus galaxy cluster, a section of the universe filled with globular clusters, or tightly bound units filled with millions of stars. Accordingly, this neighborhood is known for its particularly rich population of densely packed stars.

Then, Hubble noticed a close collection of four globular clusters among the bunch. When Hubble, ESA's Euclid, and the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii collectively took a closer look, astronomers noticed a faint glow circling the area—leading them to wonder if the whole thing was actually just one galaxy.

The researchers behind the study conducted a statistical analysis of the galaxy, finding that the four clusters likely are part of a single galaxy—and a dark one at that.

“This is the first galaxy detected solely through its globular cluster population,” David Li, the study's lead author and an astronomer at the University of Toronto, said in a NASA release.

According to the researchers, CDG-2 has a luminosity equivalent to roughly 6 million Sun-like stars, with the globular clusters contributing around 16% of that total. In terms of mass, however, 99% of the galaxy's mass appears to be dark matter.

The “normal” matter in CDG-2—primarily hydrogen gas for star formation—was likely stripped away by the dense population of galaxies inside the Perseus cluster, the scientists said. But even if CDG-2 isn't necessarily a dark galaxy, it's still an odd one, the researchers said, and would be an ideal candidate to study and test theories on clustered star formation and its potential implications, according to the paper.

Either way, it looks like astronomers have no shortage of things they're counting on dark matter to prove.

The era of AI has not been particularly great for cybersecurity. We know that vibe-coded websites and apps have been a hotbed of security flaws that leave the platforms vulnerable to attacks. It turns out that vibe-generating your passwords also puts you at risk. New research from cybersecurity firm Irregular found that passwords generated by large language models appear strong but are “fundamentally insecure” and shockingly easy to guess.

To determine the capability of popular AI models to act as your password generator, Irregular asked Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini to generate 16-character, secure passwords that include special characters, numbers, and letters—and in some cases, passphrases. The models are capable of spitting out strings of characters that appear like any auto-generated password from your password manager or built-in password tools provided by Google or Apple. They even scored as being strong passwords according to online checkers like KeePass.

And yet, they proved quite crackable. Why? Because large language models are not particularly good at randomization. For instance, when the researchers asked Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 model to generate 50 unique passwords, it actually used a very predictable pattern. Every password it generated started with a letter, most of which were an uppercase “G.” The second character was almost always the digit “7.” The characters “L,” “9,” “m,” “2,” “$” and “#” appeared in all 50 passwords, and most of the alphabet never appeared in any of the 50 options.

Other models had similar issues. OpenAI's ChatGPT started nearly every single password with the character “v” and nearly half of all passwords used “Q” as their second character. Like Claude, ChatGPT stuck with a narrow subset of characters when generating a password, instead of making use of the full alphabet. Google's Gemini had the same patterns, with most of its passwords starting with either an uppercase or lowercase “K.” The characters that followed were almost always some variation of “#,” “P,” or “9.”

The researchers even noted that the LLMs seemed to make choices that would make passwords appear more random but actually reveal a lack of randomness. The researchers noted that there were zero instances of repeating characters throughout the generated passwords. While that makes the outputs look more randomized at a glance, Irregular noted, “Probabilistically, this would be very unlikely if the passwords were truly random.”

Password strength is generally measured by bits of entropy, which is meant to measure how many guesses it would take to crack a password. For instance, if you could only choose between two passwords—let's say “11111” or “12345”—there is a 50% chance of someone guessing your password. That means there is 1 bit of entropy. If your password can be any one of 1,000 words, it would take a person up to 1,000 tries to guess it, which is about 10 bits of entropy. By having a high variance of options for each character within a password, you create more bits of entropy, which makes it harder to brute-force the password. A password with 20 bits of entropy generates about one million possibilities, but that can be cracked in a matter of seconds if the attacker is using modern, high-end GPUs to generate guesses. Meanwhile, a password with 100 bits of entropy would take trillions of years to crack.

So just how bad are LLM-generated passwords? According to the researchers, if a truly secure password would produce 6.13 bits of entropy per character, LLM-generated outputs are closer to 2.08 bits of entropy. If a standard, truly secure 16-character password would have about 98 bits of entropy, the LLMs were only able to spit out passwords with an estimated 27 bits of entropy, making them extremely susceptible to brute-force attacks.

It'd be easy enough to avoid this as an individual: Just don't use an LLM to generate your password. Gemini even offers a prompt telling you that you shouldn't use passwords it creates for sensitive accounts. But increasingly, people are offloading coding and other tasks to AI agents. And even those agents are prone to relying on LLMs to do password creation. The researchers said they were able to find common LLM-created patterns in the wild by searching GitHub and other technical documents, meaning there are password-protected apps and services out there just waiting to be cracked.

Irregular doesn't seem to think this is a problem that can be addressed with a simple update, either. “People and coding agents should not rely on LLMs to generate passwords. Passwords generated through direct LLM output are fundamentally weak, and this is unfixable by prompting or temperature adjustments: LLMs are optimized to produce predictable, plausible outputs, which is incompatible with secure password generation,” the company said.

Gizmodo reached out to Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google for comment on the findings of the researchers, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

Here's some good news for Predator fans, especially those who'd love to see director Dan Trachtenberg keep making new films in the franchise. Predator: Badlands raked in nine million views in its first five days on Hulu—making it the top film premiere on the streamer since… well, Trachtenberg's 2022 Predator movie, Prey.

Prey was released straight to Hulu, while Badlands had a theatrical run starting in November 2025. It became the highest-grossing Predator film before making its streaming debut last week.

According to a Disney press release, “Audiences have streamed more than 300 [million] hours of the Predator franchise on Disney+ and Hulu globally.” That includes another Trachtenberg creation, 2025's straight-to-Hulu animated saga Predator: Killer of Killers, as well as the rest of the series to date.

Not bad for a franchise that kicked off in 1987 as an Arnold Schwarzenegger action vehicle—then expanded its lore about alien killers who pride themselves on being the ultimate hunters with multiple sequels and crossovers with the Alien universe.

Badlands' popularity in both the movie theater and in home release—not to mention the jolt of energy the franchise got from Prey—only strengthens the hope that Trachtenberg, who just signed a new deal with Paramount, will come back to Disney eventually to make another Predator film.

Speaking to io9 in an interview tied to Badlands' Hulu release, Trachtenberg emphasized that his Paramount alliance doesn't mean he won't reunite with the Yautja at some point. In fact, it's on his mind, and he's looking forward to it, whenever it happens.

“I'm in this moment that I was in when Prey came out, where I was like, ‘What do I do next?' and got very excited about a Predator protagonist and got very excited about an animated movie with multiple time periods, and then they just happened to go at the same time,” he said. “And so that's where I'm at with Predator now, is, ‘Oh my God, there are so many exciting things we can do.'”

Clearly, the audience is there—and will happily follow Trachtenberg back into the fray.

Even if you haven't yet watched the most recent episode of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, “In the Name of the Mother,” it's not a spoiler to say the Trial of Seven was excruciating. Dunk (Peter Claffey) and the other characters get put through hell fighting each other on the battlefield, and the viewer is left cringing while watching all the blows, jabs, slashes, and stabs. If the sequences felt especially visceral, even while watching from the comfort and safety of your couch, you have the creative minds behind the series, including showrunner Ira Parker and director Owen Harris, to thank.

Speaking to IndieWire, A Knight of the Seven Kingdom‘s crew explained how focusing on Dunk's inner thoughts and feelings was important for the show, not just because he's the main character and the story unfolds from his perspective, but because George R.R. Martin's novellas are mostly a running monologue of Dunk's reactions to everything around him. The trial is the most stressful situation Dunk has ever faced, so the creators wanted to find a way to bring that to the screen in a way that would make the most impact.

“We were doing our best to keep the audience immersed in his world. Dunk, in the novellas, has probably the most [anxious] inner monologue of George's characters. So obviously, a big challenge of this was going to be bringing that out,” Parker explained.

One way was by emphasizing Dunk's elevated breathing as well as his limited vision, framing a shot that seems to be coming from the inside of Dunk's helmet. Sound editor Alastair Sirkett told IndieWire, “To be able to go into that first part with the breathing in the helmet, I think it immediately takes you into [Dunk's panic] … that breathing, Peter was so into it. He knew where we were going with it and what we were trying to do, and got himself into that zone to give us that anxiety, sharp breathing. It was really perfect.”

As for the in-helmet shot, Harris explained, “It was a mixture of how do we do some great action and make it dramatic and exciting and entertaining, but how do we also keep the character and the tone of the show going throughout all of it.”

“You spend the whole show going on this journey with this guy, and finally you are quite literally inside his head—and the claustrophobia and anxiety of being trapped in this thing while people try to kill you? We're finding the balance between wanting to do something eye-catching and entertaining, but ultimately honest.”

The season finale of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms arrives Sunday on HBO and HBO Max.

China could overtake the U.S. in brain computer interface (BCI) technology leadership in the coming months/years, thanks to a fortunate mix of government support and investor enthusiasm. In a recent interview with the Financial Times (FT), Tiger Tao, the founder of Shanghai-based NeuroXess, highlighted the rapid progress of the firm's BCI technology. NeuroXess (no relation to Intel XeSS) was set up in 2021 and has already reported some successful human BCI trials.

The FT report comes less than six months after we covered news of China's plans to outpace Neuralink with a state-backed BCI blitz, to coin a phrase.

At that time, a sweeping government policy document came into effect, with a fast, aggressive roadmap. It sought to coordinate and combine China's huge resources and oil the wheels of progress by streamlining planning, regulatory approval, and financing. At the time of writing, there have already been 10 invasive BCI trial programs in China. The hope was/is to produce two to three ‘world-class' BCI companies by 2030, and it looks like NeuroXess could be one of them.

 




As for NeuroXess' success, it seems to have been rapid. As mentioned in the intro, it was only founded in 2021. Now just half a decade old, it has recently boasted of using its BCI tech to allow a paralyzed patient to control a computer cursor. Moreover, the patient was using their BCI for computing tasks just five days after the implant operation.

NeuroXess trials have been using invasive BCI tech, and partly because of this, the focus has been on areas of strong medical need – like patients with paralysis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). No one without a strong medical need would be interested in a brain operation, and such a device being implanted.

The NeuroXess BCI uses a polyimide and metal mesh, but it sits on the patient's brain and doesn't pierce any brain tissue. This contrasts with Elon Musk's Neuralink, which uses an implant bristling with microscopic threads to capture neural signals from within the brain. There have been concerns about electrodes going into brain tissue, causing scarring and thus the degradation of brain signal readings over time. Neuralink denies this is an issue, with its super-thin electrodes, butNeuroXess sidesteps the issue altogether.

Comparing Neuralink and NeuroXess in performance terms, the latest performance data shared by the FT suggests the former has achieved brain links at 10 bps in trials, and the Chinese tech is capable of 5.2 bps. You can see the NeuroXess speeds confirmed in the video linked in the intro.

While the race for the best invasive implant BCI continues, a BCI expert that the FT talked to noted that firms are using the latest knowledge from this frontier to the benefit of non-invasive systems. It is hoped that the advances could eventually improve non-invasive BCIs so much that operations/implants become minor or unnecessary, in general.

This optimization work is expected to be easier in China, with a virtuous circle coming into play: more data, lower costs, resulting in more users, and more data.

“Teleporting quantum information is now a practical reality,” asserts Deutsche Telekom. The firm's T‑Labs used commercially available Qunnect hardware to demo quantum teleportation over 30km of live, commercial Berlin fiber, running alongside classical internet traffic. In an email to Tom's Hardware, Deutsche Telekom's PR folks said that Cisco also ran the same hardware and demo process to connect data centers in NYC.

 






Many believed that readying quantum networks for a future quantum internet would require the deployment of new infrastructure. However, in both the Berlin and NYC demos, the qubits didn't travel through the existing fibers; they teleported from one end to another.

Last month, T-Labs completed the first practical test of the core components required for a future quantum internet, which would work by teleporting data. Central to the demo was Qunnect's Carina platform, which integrates an entanglement generator, producing pairs of quantum-entangled photons for distribution over telecom fiber.

The experiment saw the recreation of an identical quantum particle at the destination “using pre-shared quantum entanglement rather than transmitting a physical particle,” explains Deutsche Telecom.

“Our fiber optic network is quantum ready,” said Abdu Mudesir, Telekom Board Member for Product and Technology. “In Berlin we have now proven that quantum information can be transmitted over 30 kilometers of commercial Telekom fiberoptics outside of a laboratory. “

There are a few wrinkles still to iron out, though. The official PR notes that the average accuracy of the teleported data is 90%. Deutsche Telecom and Qunnect also want to network quantum computers over longer distances, more locations, and multi-node teleportation configurations.

Still, it is pleasing that this milestone has been reached, with the building blocks of teleportation already operating across a real network. The teleportation wavelength used was 795nm, which is said to be a sweet spot for integration with platforms such as neutral-atom quantum computers, atomic clocks, and various quantum sensors.

This milestone achievement shifts quantum communications from an experimental lab technology towards something telecoms providers can deploy. Key implications are expected in distributed quantum computing, quantum-secure communication, quantum sensor networks, and cloud-based quantum services.

As per the intro, Cisco used the same hardware from Qunnect to run a similar demo in NYC. We last reported on Cisco's quantum internet efforts back in November last year, when it announced plans to jointly build a distributed quantum computing network capable of linking fault-tolerant systems over long distances, with the help of IBM.

Experts from Deutsche Telekom, Qunnect, and Technical University Dresden will be available for discussion at MWC Barcelona, on March 03 from 15:30 – 16:00 (CET). Deutsche Telekom will also have a ‘Quantum Teleportation' showcase at its booth.

OpenAI may be on the cusp of securing a new stockpile of cash to burn through, with the business looking to secure $100 billion in funding from a range of tech and investment firms, Bloomberg reports. The company is reportedly seeking a valuation of around $850 billion, according to the outlet's sources. With $1.4 trillion in pledged expenditure over the next eight years, OpenAI has enormous commitments to meet. While OpenAI is also preparing for an IPO later this year, its plans have not gone without criticism, with some reportedly coming from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang himself.

 






The circular nature of AI investment and infrastructure deals has been apparent since the earliest months of 2025, and it played out throughout most of last year. Nvidia invested in companies that often bought Nvidia chips, while tech firms investing in AI developers often sold those same companies cloud computing capacity.

This latest tranche of funding for OpenAI appears to be much of the same. The key players in the deal are Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank, all of which have a mix of deals with one another and OpenAI already.

Amazon's investment is rumored to be up to $50 billion, with the condition of that investment being that OpenAI uses more of its chips and cloud computing services. SoftBank is reportedly considering a $30 billion investment, while Nvidia's is said to be $20 billion, a fifth of the total $100 billion alliance made in September 2025.

Although Microsoft's name was also thrown around by Bloomberg's sources, there was no speculation on what kind of financial contribution it would make to this round of funding. All companies involved are expected to finalize their investments by the end of February.

As with other major investment deals, even the rumored news of this one sent stock prices rising. AI industry sceptics would suggest this is one more example of why the AI industry is in a bubble: Investments that haven't happened yet generate financial returns for these companies, even without any clear path to profitability.

It's been a while since any of the big AI companies have made any enormous, headline-grabbing announcements. Indeed, a lot of the meta-story surrounding AI in recent weeks has been a crisis of confidence. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was seeming wobbled by the ""slop"" moniker, and bubble name-calling; Nvidia's Jensen Huang specifying the details of its $100 billion partnership with OpenAI, and an increasing number of studies suggesting AI isn't helping improve productivity much, if at all.

OpenAI is even projected to run out of cash entirely by 2027. But this week, the AI Impact Summit in India is being held, where all the major players in the industry are speaking. OpenAI's Sam Altman is there, as is Anthropic's Dario Amodei. OpenAI also released GPT 5.3 Codex, which is the first of OpenAI's deployments that marks a move away from being reliant solely upon Nvidia chips.

According to Bloomberg, sources close to the matter suggested that this is just the first phase of funding supplied by major names in the industry, with more to come. Once the major tech firms have signed on, OpenAI is reportedly looking to generate further investment from venture capital firms, sovereign wealth funds, and other financial investors, leading to its eventual IPO.

Although it's not explicitly stated, the fact that OpenAI is targeting these other sources after its industry contemporaries have taken the first step feels rather deliberate.

With significant spending commitments already booked in, OpenAI is clearly looking toward how it might fulfill the titanic amount of spending. At the AI India summit, it's still making more commitments for new data center deals, expending more money it doesn't yet have, on the back of confidence generated by deals that have yet to be finalized, or in some cases even officially announced. So, despite the latest funding round, reportedly backed by some of the biggest companies in the world, OpenAI still has a long road to having enough cash to deliver on its promises.

One fifth of women prefer home-based self-sampling for cervical cancer screening, with marginalized populations and those experiencing healthcare discrimination showing higher preference for this option. Privacy concerns, time constraints, and fear of embarrassment are primary drivers for considering home-based screening.

“To address cervical cancer inequities and increase screening uptake, the findings suggest US guidelines should incorporate home-based self-sampling as an alternative to clinic-based testing, women's education and empowerment should be enhanced, and tailored interventions focusing on high-risk groups are needed to increase awareness and self-confidence in performing home-based self-sampling,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Joél Fokom Domgue, MD, MPH, Division of Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. It was published online on February 6 in JAMA Network Open.

The cross-sectional design of the survey prevented establishing causal relationships between women's preferences and associated factors. Many respondents were likely unfamiliar with home-based self-sampling as it was not endorsed by US screening guidelines at the time of the survey. The study population showed potential underrepresentation of gender minority individuals, uninsured individuals, and rural dwellers, as most participants were health-insured (91.9%), heterosexual (87.2%), and residing in urban areas (85.6%). Additionally, data on prior screening history and experiences were not collected, limiting the ability to account for this potential confounder in the analysis.

The study was funded by grant P30CA016672 from the National Cancer Institute, the Betty B. Marcus Chair in Cancer Prevention, and the Duncan Family Institute for Cancer Prevention and Risk Assessment. The funders had no role in the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, manuscript preparation, or publication decisions.

In patients with HIV infection, the use of opioids alone was not associated with reduced cognition or depressive mood, whereas the combined use of opioids, antidepressants, and statins or lipid-lowering drugs other than statins was associated with lower neurocognitive performance.

“The presence of DSP modifies the relationship between opioid use and cognitive performance, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Enrico Ripamonti, PhD, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy. It was published online on February 2, 2026, in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes.

The study was limited by its cross-sectional design; reliance on self-reported medication use; lack of information on opioid use history, duration, and detailed dosing; and a predominantly male sample with high AIDS prevalence, which may have limited generalizability to other patients with HIV infection.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Currently, obesity affects 2 in 5 adults and 1 in 5 children in the US. For the past three decades, other countries have experienced a double or triple escalation in obesity prevalence as well. It is associated with comorbidities that significantly increase the risk for mortality, including hypertension. Hypertension, especially in patients who have obesity, is a major risk factor for complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular disease.

According to the latest standards of care published by the American Heart Association, certain beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, propranolol, and atenolol, should not typically be used to treat hypertension in patients with obesity owing to their weight-promoting effects. Instead, weight-neutral drugs such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics should be prioritized. However, the guidelines note that achieving blood pressure treatment goals may take precedence over potential weight effects in specific clinical situations.

For children and adolescents with obesity, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine evaluation for hypertension and blood pressure monitoring at every clinic visit starting at age 3. Early screening facilitates detection and prevention of hypertension-related comorbidities. The guidelines do note there is a potential for improper measurement or misclassification. Overall, researchers found that the benefits of early screening exceed the potential for harm.

Obesity and hypertension have a well-studied dose-response relationship, with the often-cited Framingham Heart Study showing that the risk for hypertension increases 20%-30% for every 5% increase in body weight. According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, lowering a patient's body weight can reverse this effect, and a mean BMI reduction of 2.27 leads to a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 5.79 mm Hg and 3.36 mm Hg, respectively. This is also consistent with a recent review published in JAMA, which found that a 5%-10% decrease in weight led to reductions of 3 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure. Conversely, research cited by the Department of Veteran Affairs clinical practice guideline for obesity found that hypertension risk increased by 30% for every single SD increase in BMI.

A recent review concluded that calorie restriction, specifically the DASH diet, is the most effective intervention for lowering blood pressure through weight loss. The review cites a comprehensive meta-analysis, which notes ""aerobic exercise, isometric training, low‐sodium and high‐potassium salt, comprehensive lifestyle modification, salt restriction, breathing‐control, meditation and low‐calorie diet also have obvious effects on blood pressure reduction,"" but low-calorie diets could lower blood pressure more than exercise alone. The DASH diet involves low intakes of fat, sugar, and salt and high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grain, and lean protein. It may have an even greater anti-hypertensive effect than the Mediterranean diet.

Learn more about nonpharmacologic intervention for hypertension.

A recent review of metabolic surgery's effect on hypertension found that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which is the most common bariatric surgery performed, had the most significant effect on reducing blood pressure. Although other modalities such as gastric banding, BPD/DS, and DJBL showed effectiveness compared to nonsurgical interventions, the differences were not statistically significant. This is consistent with another recent review that found evidence for gastric bypass improving hypertension in approximately 70% of patients.

A narrative review reported that GLP-1s in adults with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D) were linked to an increased risk for nutritional deficiencies — especially vitamin D, iron, and B vitamins — highlighting the need for regular nutritional assessment.

“Micronutrient deficiencies during GLP-1 therapy are a common consequence rather than a rare adverse effect. Additionally, findings illustrate that GLP-1 RA [receptor agonist]-associated nutritional risk is clinically relevant,” the authors of the study wrote.

“One of the objectives of this review is to raise awareness of this complication and to encourage a broader differential diagnosis in patients receiving GLP-1 therapy who present with unexplained neurologic symptoms, functional decline, or constitutional changes during periods of marked caloric restriction,” they added.

The study was led by Jorge Urbina, MD, Autonomous University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico. It was published online in Clinical Obesity.

The primary limitation is the reliance on retrospective database cohorts, cross-sectional analyses, and small prospective studies, with no large randomized trials conducted . Two studies had disproportionate numbers of patients, and the researchers acknowledged that this fact may skew the results.

Most studies used retrospective data and dietary recall instead of direct body composition measurements. The heterogeneous nature of GLP-1 exposure and treatment response in real-world populations further complicated the analysis.

The authors reported receiving no external funding. One author declared being a consultant and proctor for Intuitive Surgical and a consultant for Medtronic and Endolumik.

Women with obesity lost more weight with a novel multicomponent nutrition intervention called NutrirCom than on a calorie-restricted diet.

“The actions proposed by the protocol, such as mindful eating, active listening, spirituality, sleep promotion, and encouragement of enjoyable physical activity, targeted multiple dimensions of care and were fundamental to improving participants' quality of life,” the authors wrote. “The integration of these aspects is associated with greater adherence to behavior change and the sustainability of the outcomes achieved…. The collective sessions promot[ed] a sense of belonging, bonding, and shared responsibility among participants.”

The study, led by Irene da Silva Araújo Gonçalves of Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Brazil, was published online in Nutrients.

The study was limited by the possibility of selection bias, since participants who remained in the study may have been more motivated, available, or engaged with healthcare. In addition, the multicomponent nature of the intervention limited the attribution of effects to isolated components of it.

The study was funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; the Municipal Government of Viçosa, which covered all laboratory tests; and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel. 

The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

Dr Rob Hicks

England is in the throes of a mental health crisis of “pandemic proportion,” the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) has warned, with many people unable to access help when they need it. 

The situation has “spiralled out of control,” the college said, with patients increasingly only able to access care at crisis point because services are overwhelmed and underresourced.

RCPsych president Dr Lade Smith described the situation as “atrocious” and warned that the longer the scale of the challenge was ignored, the harder it would be to overcome.

The college called on the government to ensure that community mental health services are resourced to deliver early intervention, continuity of care, and assertive outreach. This would help patients remain engaged with treatment and reduce relapse and mental health crisis, it said.

In England in 2024-2025, 4.1 million people were in contact with mental health services, up 56% from 2.6 million in 2016-2017, according to NHS data. The number of children and young people in contact with services rose by 118%, from 500,000 to 1.2 million over the same period. 

Of 1.1 million urgent and emergency referrals to crisis care teams in 2024 and 2025, around 11% were for under-18s.

Many people with mental health needs spent more than 24 hours waiting in A&E. Urgent and emergency mental health beds were nearly full, with occupancy rates of 95%-97% between 2022 and 2024. As a result, some patients were sent out of their local area because no bed was available. 

“Services are struggling to manage millions of additional patients,” said Smith. Patients without timely access to treatment were at greater risk of relapse, becoming more unwell, and, in rare cases, posing a danger to themselves or others, she added. “But they often wouldn't reach this point if they could get care and treatment earlier.”

Mental health receives less than 9% of NHS spending despite accounting for around 20% of the national disease burden, according to the RCPsych.

According to the college, mental health services should receive approximately £36 billion in 2025-2026 rather than the £15.6 billion currently expected.

“Mental health services cannot be expected to deliver outstanding care with only half the necessary funding,” Smith said.

The RCPsych called for community mental healthcare to be prioritised and for new waiting time standards to ensure people receive care before reaching crisis. It also urged the introduction of response time standards for urgent and emergency mental healthcare, and intelligent commissioning of beds so that provision meets local demand.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is vital that anyone struggling with their mental health is able to access the timely help and support they need.

“We're investing an extra £688 million in mental health services this year, hiring almost 8000 additional mental health workers, and we will roll out Mental Health Support Teams to every school and college in England.

“This government is also introducing new, 24/7 Neighbourhood Mental Health Centres and Mental Health Emergency Departments so help is always there for those that need it.”

Edited by Deepa Varma

Dupilumab, approved in 2025 by the US FDA to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), significantly reduced symptoms in patients with antihistamine (AH)-resistant CSU in a randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial.

“Dupilumab demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful efficacy in omalizumab-naive patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H1-AH treatment in CUPID-C,” which is consistent with the findings from the CUPID-A study, the authors of the study wrote. The combined data from CUPID-A and CUPID-C, they added, “collectively reinforce the clinical benefits and safety profile of dupilumab for H1-AH-refractory and omalizumab-naive patients with CSU.”

The study was led by Thomas B. Casale, MD, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, and was published online on February 18 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study follow‑up was limited to 24 weeks, pediatric representation was small, and racial or ethnic diversity was limited.

The study was sponsored by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Casale reported receiving grants from the University of South Florida and personal fees from Genentech, Jasper, Novartis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Sanofi. Several authors reported receiving consulting fees, honoraria, grants, and personal fees from many drug companies, including Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and having patents pending for treatment of CSU. Four authors reported having equity in Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, with one author being employed by Sanofi during the study period.

A nationwide registry-based study found that 1 in 5 kidney transplant recipients experienced fractures within 10 years post-transplant, with the risk remaining stable over two decades despite advances in treatment. Among those who sustained a fracture, 28% had at least one subsequent fracture, with the highest risk seen at 6-12 months after the initial event.

""This study demonstrates that fracture risk remains a major challenge in kidney transplant recipients even under steroid minimization protocols. We emphasize the continued disease burden caused by bone fragility and the overlooked risk of subsequent fracture following a first event,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ina Karstoft Ystrøm, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on February 06, 2026, in Clinical Kidney Journal.

The retrospective design and the lack of individual-level data on targeted therapy, immunosuppressive therapy (including corticosteroids), bone density results, fracture risk profile, and fracture trauma mechanisms may have limited the study's findings. Many vertebral fractures were likely underreported due to their asymptomatic nature. Additionally, the findings may not be generalisable to other ethnic groups as the cohort was predominantly of European descent.

This study received financial support from the Health Research Foundation of the Central Denmark Region, the Danish Society of Nephrology's Research Foundation, Nyreforeningens Forskningsfond, and other sources.

Adults aged 60 years or older with type 2 diabetes (T2D) had the lowest mortality when their interprofessional care leaned slightly towards nurses; however, care dominated by GPs was associated with the highest mortality.

""This study is an opening on the optimal level of interprofessional T2D care, showing variation in all-cause mortality associated with the level of interprofessional care index in a public PHC [primary healthcare] setting,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Eero Mellanen, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. It was published online on February 09, 2026, in Primary Care Diabetes.

The study lacked data on several important factors, including the use of home care unit services, smoking status, and the duration and complications of diabetes. The comorbidity index may not have fully captured the tendency of patients with more severe conditions to visit physicians more frequently. Patients may have developed conditions requiring more frequent appointments during follow-up, potentially affecting the interprofessional care index values.

Maria Cristina Valsecchi

MILAN, Italy — If social media from the Milan‑Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics collect likes on videos of athletes rating pasta, pizza, and tiramisu in the Olympic village cafeterias, the nutritional reality for many female athletes is far more concerning. The athletes we see appearing light and graceful in figure skating, those who launch from ski-jumping ramps and those competing in endurance events such as cross‑country skiing — disciplines in which a low body‑weight‑to‑power ratio can be advantageous — are among the most at risk for energy deficiency caused by highly restrictive diets combined with intense training. Prolonged inadequate caloric intake disrupts ovarian function and estrogen production, compromising the normal process of bone remodeling and increasing the risk for osteoporosis and fractures. Low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and altered bone remodeling constitute the syndrome known as the “female athlete triad.”

In December of last year, ahead of the Games, the Female Athlete Triad Coalition, an international nonprofit organization of health professionals, published a two‑part consensus statement: The first reviews the latest research findings on the topic, and the second lays out recommendations for appropriate and timely treatment.

Adipose tissue is not merely an inert storage depot but a true endocrine organ. “It secretes adipokines, hormones that act on the hypothalamus‑pituitary‑gonadal axis,” explained Sabrina Corbetta, associate professor of endocrinology at the University of Milan. “If the percentage of body fat is too low, adipokine production falls and the chemical signaling that controls ovarian function is altered.”

The consequences vary depending on the extent and duration of the energy deficit. They range from menstrual irregularities to complete amenorrhea and cessation of estrogen production by the ovaries, the endocrinologist continued. “Bone health depends on estrogen action. Prolonged hormone deficiency interferes with bone turnover: Old bone matrix is resorbed, while formation of new bone decreases. The result is osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures, including micro stress fractures caused by repeated application of excessive loads during training. These small injuries, which often affect the metatarsals, the tibias, and the rib cage, cause inflammation and pain.”

The Female Athlete Triad Coalition's consensus statement pays particular attention to very young athletes engaged in competitive sports. Energy deficiency can have more severe consequences for bodies that are still developing. “By about age 25, an individual reaches the maximum bone density allowed by their genetic potential and other factors. After that peak, bone density stabilizes and then declines with age,” Corbetta explained. The higher the peak at age 25, the lower the risk for osteoporosis later in life. Dietary restrictions and reduced estrogen production during adolescence lower that peak bone mass and therefore increase future osteoporosis risk. We have no evidence of full recovery later; this is, therefore, an irreversible harm.”

Prevention is essential for young athletes entering competitive sports.It includes adapting to a balanced, personalized diet and, when necessary, supplements such as calcium and vitamin D to strengthen bones. When there is a significant estrogen deficiency, taking an estrogen‑progestin oral contraceptivemay not be sufficient. Sometimes hormone replacement therapy, preferably administered transdermally.

Eating disorders and dysfunctional behaviors such as compulsive exercise can also contribute to the energy deficit that underlies the female athlete triad. For this reason, the Female Athlete Triad Coalition consensus statement recommends a multidisciplinary treatment approach that involves both a sports dietitian and a mental‑health professional.

The sports medicine specialist responsible for certifying fitness for competitive activity also acts as a sentinel for eating disorders such as athletic anorexia, which is considered a presentation of anorexia nervosa in the sports context rather than a separate diagnostic category. It is not characterized by body‑image distortion but is instead driven by the pursuit of improved performance, and it is often underdiagnosed because it is normalized within the sporting environment.

The prevalence of anxiety or depression increased significantly between 2019 and 2023, especially for men, Black individuals, and people born outside the US, a new cross-sectional study showed. However, the greatest increase in prevalence was in Black women without disabilities born outside the US.

“These findings suggest the need for tailored mental health interventions that consider disability status and demographic intersections,” the investigators wrote. 

The study was led by David Adzrago, PhD, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, Bethesda, Maryland. It was published online on February 2 in JAMA Network Open. 

All measures were self-reported and susceptible to recall and social desirability biases. The NHIS included only the civilian noninstitutionalized US population, excluding individuals living in long-term care or residential facilities. Additionally, as the NHIS was administered only in English, the findings were not generalizable to the entire US adult population.

The study was funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. One investigator reported receiving grants from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The other four researchers reported no relevant financial relationships.

Across awake tracheal intubations using videolaryngoscopy for suspected difficult airways, the overall success rate was high. Overall or first-attempt success rates did not differ between non-channeled and channeled devices.

""Awake tracheal intubation using videolaryngoscopy is an effective and safe technique for patients with anticipated difficult airways. Both channeled and non-channeled VLs [videolaryngoscopes] achieved high overall success rates and a low incidence of major complications, suggesting that device selection should be tailored to patient characteristics and operator experience. The favorable patient tolerance and low perceived procedural difficulty further support the role of VL as a valuable tool in advanced airway management,"" the researchers wrote.

The study was led by Jorge Fernández of the Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine at the University Clinical Hospital of Santiago in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. It was published online on February 17, 2026, in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain Medicine.

Anesthesiologists chose the videolaryngoscopy device, which may have introduced selection bias and restricted head-to-head comparisons. Operator‑completed forms could have under‑ or overestimated difficulty or complications. Protocols for sedation, topical anesthesia, and intubation techniques were not standardized.

The study did not receive any funding. The authors declared having no competing interests.

In a multicentre real-world study, treatment with amivantamab was associated with diverse dermatologic adverse events in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with 65.9% developing multiple toxicities and 26.7% experiencing adverse events of grade 3 or higher.

""Amivantamab is associated with a broad and sometimes severe spectrum of dAEs [dermatologic adverse events] in real-world practice. Awareness of characteristic ulcerative scalp and mucocutaneous presentations, together with timely dermatologic assessment, is essential to support continuation of oncologic therapy,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Vasiliki Nikolaou, 1st Department of Dermatology and Venereology, ""Andreas Syngros"" Hospital for Skin Diseases, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece. It was published online on February 11, 2026, in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology.

The high frequency of scalp ulcerative lesions and severe dermatologic toxicities observed in the study might reflect referral bias inherent to specialised oncodermatology centres, potentially affecting the generalisability of the findings.

Rural areas in the US saw a net loss of 22 birth hospitals offering higher-level neonatal care from 2010 to 2022, whereas urban areas experienced a net gain of 31. In 2022, less than 20% of rural hospitals offered higher-level neonatal care, whereas 74.4% of urban hospitals provided such care.

“Rural-urban differences in higher-level neonatal care availability may contribute to the survival gap for rural infants,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Katy B. Kozhimannil, PhD, MPA, Division of Health Policy and Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. It was published online on February 12, 2026, as a research letter in JAMA Network Open.

The study relied on self-reported hospital data, which may not accurately reflect neonatal bed usage. The number of hospitals decreased over time, particularly in rural areas, owing to the closure of hospitals and obstetric units. Patient-level data were lacking, thereby affecting the analysis of patient outcomes.

The study was supported by grants from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy, Health Resources and Services Administration, US Department of Health and Human Services, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health. Two authors reported receiving grants outside the submitted work, and one of them reported receiving personal fees from the University of Minnesota during the conduct of the study.

Statin use in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) was associated with reduced risks for hepatic decompensation and major adverse liver outcomes.

“These findings suggest a potential role for statins in improving long-term liver-related outcomes in patients with PBC, a population with limited therapeutic options beyond UDCA [ursodeoxycholic acid] and obeticholic acid,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Jonggi Choi, MD, PhD, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, and Junqing Xu, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston. It was published online in Hepatology.

The study could not fully assess or adjust for alcohol use history. Some patients may have had metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, which could introduce confounding. Liver stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter-based steatosis measurements were not available for many patients. The study lacked histologic data and detailed clinical assessments, limiting the ability to stratify risk or assess treatment response heterogeneity.

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. One author disclosed receiving grants from Gilead, and another author reported consulting for RegCell and having an advisory role with Ipsen, Gilead, and Mirum.

Scientists at Nagoya University in Japan have found two gut bacteria working together that contribute to chronic constipation. The duo, Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, destroy the intestinal mucus coating essential for keeping the colon lubricated and feces hydrated. Their excess degradation leaves patients with dry, immobile stool. This discovery, published in Gut Microbes, finally explains why standard treatments often fail for millions of people with chronic constipation.

Notably, the study shows that Parkinson's disease patients, who suffer from constipation decades before developing tremors, have higher levels of these mucus-degrading bacteria. While constipation in Parkinson's disease has traditionally been attributed to nerve degradation, these findings suggest that bacterial activity also plays a crucial role in the development of their symptoms. 

Constipation is a very common digestive problem. Doctors have assumed it happens because of slow gut movement when our intestines are not moving food along fast enough. However, this explanation does not work for everyone. 

Some people have constipation with no identifiable cause, referred to as chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Parkinson's disease patients also face severe, treatment-resistant constipation, though it is clinically categorized separately from CIC. Many struggle with severe constipation for 20 or 30 years before they develop tremors and movement problems, but researchers did not know why until now. 

Instead of focusing on nerve and muscle movement in the gut, the researchers examined the protective gel-like coating called colonic mucin, a substance in the large intestine that lines the intestinal walls and is found within stool. Colonic mucin keeps stool moist, helps it move smoothly through our digestive tract, and protects the intestinal wall from bacteria. 

They found that two gut bacteria work in sequence to break down this mucin. B. thetaiotaomicron uses enzymes to remove protective sulfate groups from the mucin, and A. muciniphila then breaks down and consumes the exposed mucin.

Sulfate groups attached to colonic mucin molecules normally prevent bacteria from degrading them. When too much mucin is destroyed, stool loses moisture and becomes hard and dry, causing constipation. Because the problem is mucin loss, not slow gut movement, standard laxatives and gut motility drugs are often ineffective. 

We genetically modified B. thetaiotaomicron so it could no longer activate the enzyme sulfatase that removes sulfate groups from mucin.

We put these modified bacteria into germ-free mice together with Akkermansia muciniphila, and surprisingly the mice did not develop constipation; the mucin stayed protected and intact."" 

Tomonari Hamaguchi, lead author and lecturer from the Academic Research & Industry-Academia-Government Collaboration Office at Nagoya University

The experiment proved that blocking the sulfatase enzyme prevents the bacteria from degrading mucin. Therefore, drugs that block sulfatase could treat bacterial constipation in humans. 

For millions of patients with treatment-resistant constipation, including those with Parkinson's disease, this discovery offers hope for new therapies that address the root microbial causes of their condition.

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have discovered that a second pregnancy alters the female brain. Previous research from the same group had already demonstrated the impact of a first pregnancy on the female brain. These results are published today in Nature Communications. The research demonstrates that both a first and a second pregnancy have a strong and unique impact on mothers' brains.

A previous study by Elseline Hoekzema and colleagues was the first to show that pregnancy changes the structure of the human brain. The research group also discovered that pregnancy changes brain functioning. For this follow-up study, they tracked 110 women: some became mothers for the first time, others had their second child, and a third group remained childless. Repeated brain scans allowed them to see exactly what changed in the brain.

With this, we have shown for the first time that the brain not only changes during the first pregnancy, but also during a second. During a first and second pregnancy, the brain changes in both similar and unique ways. Each pregnancy leaves a unique mark on the female brain.""

Elseline Hoekzema, head of the Pregnancy Brain Lab at Amsterdam UMC

The greatest changes during a first pregnancy occurred in the structure and activity of the so-called Default Mode Network. This part of the brain is important for many functions including self-reflection and social processes. During a second pregnancy, this network changed again, but less strongly. However, during a second pregnancy, there were more changes in brain networks related to directing attention and responding to stimuli. ""It appears that during a second pregnancy, the brain is more strongly altered in networks involved in reacting to sensory cues and in controlling your attention"", explains researcher Milou Straathof, who analyzed the data. ""These processes may be beneficial when caring for multiple children.""

The researchers also found a link between changes in the brain and the bond between mother and child. This link was more prominent during a first pregnancy than during a second. In addition, the researchers observed connections between structural brain changes and peripartum depression, both during a first and a second pregnancy, providing the first evidence that the changes taking place in a woman's cortex during pregnancy relate to maternal depression. For women who became mothers for the first time, this was especially visible after childbirth. For women having their second child, this was particularly the case during their pregnancy. ""This knowledge can help to better understand and recognize mental health problems in mothers. It is important that we understand how the brain adapts to motherhood.""

This research provides new insights into how the female brain adapts to motherhood. The large majority of women become pregnant once or multiple times in their lives, yet we are only now starting to unravel how this impacts a woman's brain. This study contributes to addressing this important gap in knowledge on women's biology. The results can also contribute to better care for mothers, for example in preventing and treating postpartum depression. The findings also show that the brain is flexible and can continually adapt to major changes in a woman's life.

A controlled human study reveals that coffee's complex chemical matrix may shape immune responses differently than pure caffeine, highlighting how everyday dietary exposures can subtly influence physiology.



Study: Immune modulation in response to coffee intake: a pilot study. Image Credit: ZeiMomArt / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers evaluated the acute immunological effects of coffee compared with an equivalent dose of caffeine in solution and water in healthy adults.

Coffee consumption and caffeine exposure are widely studied due to their potential metabolic and immunological effects, which affect quality of life and generate public health interest. Many individuals consume caffeine regularly, and understanding its physiological effects remains important, while recognizing that biomarker changes do not necessarily translate into clinical health outcomes.

Dietary bioactive compounds, including caffeine and coffee polyphenols, have attracted attention for possible immunomodulatory effects. Caffeine is a methylxanthine present in coffee, acting partly through adenosine receptor antagonism rather than serotonergic pathways. Unlike pharmaceutical interventions, coffee intake represents a common dietary exposure rather than a clinical treatment, making its physiological impact relevant for everyday health research but not indicative of therapeutic effects.

In the present study, researchers evaluated the acute effects of orally consumed coffee compared with an aqueous caffeine solution and water in healthy volunteers. This was a randomized crossover pilot study involving a small sample (n = 10). Participants were aged 20 to 40 years, healthy, non-smoking regular coffee consumers with normal body mass index.

Individuals with chronic disease, medication use, pregnancy, or other health conditions affecting metabolism or immunity were excluded. Subjects were administered coffee brew, a caffeine solution, or water containing an equivalent caffeine dose (130 mg/100 mL) after a standardized meal to control for postprandial metabolic effects.

In each study phase, participants received one of the three beverages in randomized order with washout periods between sessions. The dose, approximately 130 mg caffeine per serving, was consumed orally.

The primary outcome was the postprandial immune response, including circulating cytokines and caffeine pharmacokinetics. Secondary measures included comparisons of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma and interleukins, as well as caffeine exposure assessed by area under the curve. Safety monitoring included standard clinical observations appropriate for nutritional research.

Statistical analyses involved repeated-measures comparisons of cytokine levels and caffeine pharmacokinetics between interventions.

The study randomized 10 healthy participants to coffee, caffeine solution, and water crossover conditions. Participants were, on average, young adults and habitual coffee drinkers, with comparable baseline characteristics across interventions.

Immune marker responses differed modestly between interventions. Pure caffeine produced more pronounced suppression of certain cytokines, including interferon gamma and selected interleukins, whereas coffee often elicited responses closer to the water control despite equivalent caffeine content.

Systemic caffeine exposure was higher after coffee consumption than after the caffeine solution, suggesting potential matrix effects from other coffee constituents that may influence absorption or metabolism, although the authors interpreted this cautiously, given the pilot-scale design.

Most physiological changes were acute and transient following beverage consumption, with no evidence of clinically significant adverse health effects and no indication of lasting immune alterations within the short observation period.

The intervention was well tolerated among participants who received coffee or other caffeine-containing beverages. No serious adverse events or clinically meaningful abnormalities were reported, although minor transient physiological responses typical of caffeine intake were observed.

Acute consumption of coffee, which delivers approximately 130 mg of caffeine, produced measurable but modest immunological effects in healthy adults, distinct from those observed with isolated caffeine, suggesting that non-caffeine coffee components may modify physiological responses. The intervention appeared safe and well-tolerated.

These findings should be considered preliminary due to the small sample size, short-term design, and healthy participant population. Larger, longer studies across diverse populations and habitual intake patterns are needed to further evaluate the health implications of coffee and caffeine consumption.

Menopausal hormone therapy (commonly known as hormone replacement therapy or HRT) is not associated with an increased risk of death, finds a Danish study of over 800,000 women published by The BMJ today.

The findings support current guidelines that recommend hormone therapy for women who have recently begun menopause who have moderate to severe symptoms and no contraindications, say the researchers.

Menopausal hormone therapy can help relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep disturbance, mood swings, and depression. But its use has steadily declined during the last two decades, mainly due to safety concerns, and real world evidence regarding the effect of menopausal hormone therapy on death is lacking.

To address this, researchers used nationwide Danish registers to track women born between 1950 and 1977 and alive at age 45. Women were excluded if they had a history of blood clots, liver disease, breast, womb, or ovarian cancer, had previously used menopausal hormone therapy or undergone surgery to remove both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy).

Follow-up began on each woman's 45th birthday and ended on 31 July 2023 (a median of just over 14 years).

Potentially influential factors including age, number of children (parity), education, income, country of birth, and underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, were also taken into account.

Of the 876,805 women included in the main analysis, 104,086 (11.9%) redeemed a prescription for menopausal hormone therapy, and 47,594 (5.4%) died. By the end of the follow-up period, the median duration of menopausal hormone therapy use was 1.7 years, with 41,433 (4.7%) women using it for less than one year, and only 7,337 (0.8%) women reporting ten or more years of use.

When not considering influential factors, the risk of all-cause death for women with past or present use of menopausal hormone therapy was 54.9 deaths per 10,000 person years compared with 35.5 deaths per 10,000 for women who had never used it. However, when influential factors were taken into account, no meaningful difference in risk of death was found.

Investigating the duration of use revealed no increased risk of death, even after 10 or more years of use. And no unequivocal differences were found between the groups for specific causes of death, such as heart disease, stroke or cancer.

What's more, women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy aged 45 to 54 for non-cancerous reasons experienced a significant survival benefit when using menopausal hormone therapy, corresponding to a 27-34% lower risk of death than women in the same group who did not use hormone therapy.

The study also found some evidence suggesting that menopausal hormone therapy in a transdermal form (such as skin patches or gels) had a slightly lower risk of death compared to no treatment although the authors stress that this finding should await scrutiny in future studies.

This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the authors acknowledge several limitations that may have affected their results.

However, they point out that this was a large study based on a near complete record and follow-up of almost a generation of women, and results were materially unchanged after further sensitivity analyses, suggesting they are robust.

As such, they conclude: ""In this large nationwide cohort study, menopausal hormone therapy was not associated with increased mortality. No unequivocal differences in cardiovascular specific or cancer specific mortality were found between groups.""

The significant increase in survival found among women using menopausal hormone therapy after bilateral oophorectomy for non-cancerous reasons should also prompt further discussion as to whether more women should be offered hormone therapy after undergoing this type of surgery, they add.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Low-field MRI could offer an alternative to existing breast cancer screening methods","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260219/Low-field-MRI-could-offer-an-alternative-to-existing-breast-cancer-screening-methods.aspx","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 11:40:00 GMT","

Mass General Brigham's evaluation of low-field MRI performance lays potential groundwork for this technology to be a lower-cost, accessible option for breast imaging.

Researchers at Mass General Brigham have demonstrated the technical feasibility of using ultra-low field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for breast imaging. With further refinement and evaluation, the technology could offer an alternative to existing breast cancer screening methods and may reduce barriers to screening. Results are published in Scientific Reports.

""These results are a very encouraging proof of principle, though larger studies are needed to establish diagnostic performance,"" said project principal investigator and co-senior author Matthew Rosen, PhD, an associate professor of Radiology and director of the Low Field MRI laboratory in the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in the Mass General Brigham Department of Radiology. ""They motivate our continued pursuit of safe, comfortable, lower-cost screening approaches that can expand access for patients.""

Current U.S. guidelines recommend screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. Unlike mammography, ULF MRI doesn't require breast compression, which many patients find uncomfortable. Another benefit of ULF MRI is that it doesn't use ionizing radiation.

While higher risk patients may receive MRI screening for breast cancer, standard MRI machines are not used in routine breast cancer screening because they are expensive and not widely available. ULF MRI systems cost less than 5% of the price of standard MRI systems and have lower long-term operating costs.

In this study, ULF MRI scans were performed on 14 participants, including 11 women with no history of breast cancer, two women with a prior breast cancer diagnosis, and one woman with a benign mass.

When interpreting the ULF MRI scans, three radiologists could reliably identify essential breast features and distinguish fibroglandular tissue from adipose tissue. The authors note that discrepancies were likely related to the novelty of ULF MRI and may be reduced with additional training and experience.

""This early evidence suggests that ULF MRI can detect essential breast features and some abnormalities without radiation or injected contrast,"" said co-first author Neha Koonjoo, PhD, an investigator at the Martinos Center. ""These findings point to the potential for ULF MRI as an option that could complement existing screening tools in the future.""

""Even at very low magnetic field, the radiology team was able to make observations about the breast,"" said co-principal investigator and co-senior author Kathryn E. Keenan, PhD, from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. ""We attempted this study in hopes that the breast features would be visible, but you don't always have success. We're very motivated by this study to continue our work on ultra-low-field MRI for breast screening.""

The researchers note that further study is needed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ULF MRI for breast cancer screening, including studies in larger cohorts that include patients with benign and malignant lesions. They also emphasize that further refinements in ULF MRI technology are needed to meet clinical resolution standards for breast cancer screening.

These results will guide the next engineering steps to improve image quality and enable a more comfortable exam and help bring screening to more settings and more patients.""

A newly discovered cellular mechanism shows promise for treating painful lymphedema.

Scientists have made a breakthrough that could lead to effective treatments for lymphedema, a painful swelling condition for which there is currently no cure.

Lymphedema can be congenital or caused by an injury, but it mostly occurs as an unintended consequence following breast-cancer treatment.

It occurs when the lymphatic system, which moves fluid throughout the body via specialised vessels, is damaged, leading to fluid accumulation in tissues.

Our group of researchers has discovered a cellular process that promotes lymphatic vessel growth.

We initially made this discovery in zebrafish but have also shown that the process works in human lymphatic cells.”

Dr. Jonathan Astin, senior lecturer in molecular medicine and pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland

The scientists discovered that a growth-promoting molecule, known as ‘insulin-like growth factor', or IGF, accelerates the growth of lymphatic vessels in zebrafish, so has potential to repair damaged vessels.

They then worked with a University colleague, senior research fellow Dr Justin Rustenhoven, to grow human cells in the lab and found the IGF, could also ‘instruct' human lymphatic vessels to grow.

While IGF has long been studied, it was not previously known to have this role in promoting lymphatic vessel growth.

“This work is of interest to the medical community as it provides an additional way to induce lymphatic vessel growth,” says Astin.

“This is especially important for people with lymphedema. In Aotearoa New Zealand, approximately 20 percent of women who have lymph nodes removed as part of breast-cancer treatment will develop lymphedema, and currently there is no cure.”

The work was conducted in Astin's lab by then doctoral student Dr Wenxuan Chen and involved collaborations with Dr Kate Lee, Rustenhoven and Professor Stefan Bohlander, all in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, as well as a lab in the US.

“We use fish primarily because they're very simple, but they're still remarkably similar to us,” Astin says.

“The advantage of using fish is we can fluorescently label lymphatic vessels so that they glow and then image vessel growth in a whole larva or embryo and not impact its growth at all.

“We can just watch it grow, and things happen much quicker in a fish, because they develop much faster.”

The next step will be to test an IGF based therapy on mice with lymphedema to see whether it helps.

Astin is cautious about promising too much but says this holds the potential to become a therapy for this painful, incurable condition in the future.

Certain neighborhood characteristics, including higher poverty, more uninsured residents, and lower educational attainment, may lead to an increase in COPD-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations, according to a new study in the January 2026 issue of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation, a peer-reviewed, open access journal.

COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, affects more than 30 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. It can be caused by genetics and irritants like smoke or pollution.

Acute exacerbations, or flare-ups, are a sudden worsening of symptoms. People experiencing an acute exacerbation often require an emergency department visit or hospitalization, which can impact quality of life and health care costs.

This observational, ecological study analyzed nearly 10,000 COPD-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and 30-day readmissions in census tracts in Travis County, Texas from 2016 through 2020. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent subdivisions of a county, averaging approximately 4,000 people. Population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions are consistent among each census tract.

The results showed geographic patterns across neighborhoods when examining specific neighborhood characteristics for emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to a COPD exacerbation. Hospital readmission rates did not show the same geographic patterning.

Our findings suggest that addressing the risk of COPD exacerbations requires not just prioritizing individual medical care but also implementing community-level interventions that target neighborhood risk factors. By combining population-based data with studies focusing on an individual's exacerbation risk profile, we can inform appropriate policies to help improve people's quality of life and reduce acute care use.""

Booster vaccines reduced the risk of COVID‑19–related hospitalization and death, according to a new study of over 3 million adults who had the autumn 2022 vaccine in England. The research led by the universities of Bristol and Oxford, provides further evidence of the effectiveness of booster vaccination against COVID-19.

The study, published in Vaccine today [18 February], also found that this effectiveness was similar for Moderna (BA.1 mRNA-1273) and Pfizer-BioNTech (BA.1 BNT162b2) booster vaccines, but protection declined over time.

Previous work has shown the initial COVID-19 vaccination was effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. This latest research, carried out at the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), looked at the impact of giving people a booster vaccine.

The team investigated the effectiveness of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech booster vaccines administered during the autumn 2022 booster campaign in England for previously vaccinated people age 50 or over. 

The NHS England approved study analysed linked GP and hospital records available within the OpenSAFELY research platform. The team compared 3,464,877 adults eligible for booster vaccination during the autumn 2022 COVID-19 vaccine rollout with the same number of unboosted people.

They matched them with people who were similar in terms of age, date of last COVID-19 vaccine dose, brand of prior vaccination, clinical vulnerability and geographical region. The researchers then followed these people up for nearly a year and tracked hospitalization and death due to COVID-19.

Across 2.5 million people followed up over a year, the study recorded 14,436 COVID‑19 hospitalizations, 1,152 COVID‑19 deaths, 32,184 non‑COVID‑19 deaths and 52,758 fractures.

The study found boosted individuals had much lower 350‑day risks of COVID‑19 hospitalisation (3.78 vs 6.81 per 1,000) and death (0.29 vs 0.61 per 1,000). Boosters halved the risks of COVID‑19 hospitalisation and death. Protection waned over time, strongest in the first 70 days. Moderna and Pfizer‑BioNTech boosters performed similarly for COVID‑19 outcomes, though non‑COVID‑19 mortality was slightly higher in the mRNA‑1273 group.

The study also assessed the relationship between booster vaccination and fracture, an outcome not considered likely to be causally related. A small reduction in fracture risk was found for boosted individuals. This suggests that not all confounders (common causes of booster vaccinations and outcomes) were accounted for, but the much smaller effect for fracture is reassuring for the validity of the study's conclusions.

Our findings reinforce the importance of booster vaccination against COVID-19 among people over 50 years old.

The study also provides further evidence that COVID-19 booster vaccinations reduced the risk of hospitalization and death.""

With careful selection, same-day hospital discharge was found to be feasible and safe in around one-fifth of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a study presented today at the EAPCI Summit 2026. The summit is a new event organized by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), an association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to treat narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis). TAVI involves inserting a replacement valve on top of the old one via a catheter, usually from the groin. The procedure was initially developed as an alternative to open heart surgery for older patients and those at high risk of surgical complications; however, it is now commonly used even in people at lower risk of complications.

Presenter, Doctor Krishnarpan Chatterjee from the James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK, explained the rationale for the analysis: ""Next-day discharge after TAVI has become increasingly popular with advances in technology and streamlining of care pathways. Same-day discharge is the next step – this has been shown to be safe in a highly selected cohort of patients. At our centre, we have used a protocol with expanded inclusion criteria for same-day discharge after elective transfemoral day-case TAVI. Our day-case TAVI practice involves patients being admitted on the morning of the procedure and being discharged home the same day. We were able to demonstrate the safety of this approach in the presented analysis.""

A retrospective analysis was performed of all elective cases identified as eligible for same-day discharge following elective day-case transfemoral TAVI between June 2018 and December 2024. Eligibility criteria for same-day discharge included no significant peripheral vascular disease, an existing pacemaker or normal baseline heart rhythm, and adequate home support including supervision by a relative/friend/carer during the first night. Exclusion criteria included severe frailty, cognitive dysfunction, complex prescribing needs or clinical instability.

Of 790 patients who underwent elective transfemoral TAVI during the study period, 279 patients (35.3%) were deemed eligible for potential same-day discharge at preassessment screening and 160 of these patients (57.3%) underwent successful same-day discharge. Reasons that patients were not successfully discharged on the same day included heart rhythm conduction abnormalities (67.2%) and vascular problems (10.9%). Clinical records were retrospectively analysed to assess 30-day outcomes.

The mean age of patients who underwent same-day discharge was 80.4 years and 40% were female.

Clinical outcomes between discharge and 30 days were similar in those who underwent successful same-day discharge and those initially considered potentially eligible for same-day discharge, but who stayed in for one night or longer. Mortality rates after 30 days were 1.8% in the same-day discharge group and 0.8% in the non-same-day discharge group (p=0.472). Readmission rates after 30 days were 4.4% for same-day discharge and 9.2% for non-same-day discharge (p=0.102).

With careful selection, we have shown that around 1 in 5 patients can be successfully discharged on the same day as their day-case TAVI procedures, without increased risk of adverse outcomes. This is important for patients as it reduces the risk of complications linked to hospital stay, such as infection or delirium. It is also associated with reduced use of healthcare resources. Further studies on same-day discharge after day-case TAVI are warranted.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","High-cost rare disease drugs challenge Norwegian health priorities","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260219/High-cost-rare-disease-drugs-challenge-Norwegian-health-priorities.aspx","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 14:02:00 GMT","

New medical developments make it possible to treat an increasing number of severe and rare diseases with novel, high-cost pharmaceuticals. At the same time, there are limited resources. The aim of this thesis is to examine how the treatment of rare diseases challenges the priority-setting system in the Norwegian public health service. The findings can help inform Norwegian health policy in this field by contributing to the further development of national priority-setting processes and tools for allocating healthcare resources in clinical practice.

The thesis explores this aim both at the national level and in the encounters between physicians and patients in the clinic.The first sub-study analyses how Norwegian health priorities were discussed in the media before and after the establishment of the Decision Forum and the National System for Managed Introduction of New Health Technologies (Nye Metoder), based on the debate surrounding three high-cost treatments for cancer and rare diseases between 2013 and 2019. The study shows that these cases engage a wide range of commentators, and that discussions about individual treatments increasingly moved out of party politics after the establishment of Nye Metoder.The second sub-study investigates which criteria the public emphasises when making priority decisions between hypothetical patient groups. The findings show that patients who are expected to experience reduced informal caregiving needs or improved ability to work - societal criteria - are most likely to be prioritised. Patients who can gain more quality-adjusted life years or who have more severe conditions - health-related criteria - are also prioritised more highly. Responses related to work ability depend on whether the respondents themselves are employed.The third sub-study is based on interviews with 18 physicians regarding the introduction of a new, high-cost treatment for cystic fibrosis in 2022. Two main findings are described: Physicians negotiate the content of clinical guidelines in their encounters with patients, and they interpret the treatment cost in ways that enable them to continue offering the therapy - even when the effect is uncertain - rather than discontinuing it.The thesis increases understanding of the priority-setting challenges associated with expensive pharmaceuticals for rare diseases. The findings show that physicians often face difficult situations when translating overarching priority-setting principles into clinical practice, particularly when both the costs and the consequences for other patient groups are unclear. These insights may therefore support the further development of priority-setting tools in the healthcare system. Greater transparency in price agreements and clearer, evidence-based criteria in clinical guidelines for high-cost medicines can provide better support to clinicians when navigating uncertain treatment effects, while also contributing to fairer and more transparent priority-setting in the health service.

A review of randomized controlled trials found little to no benefit of Ginkgo biloba for mild cognitive impairment or multiple sclerosis-related cognitive symptoms. Evidence suggests small symptomatic improvements in dementia, but findings are uncertain due to study variability and limited long-term data.



Study: Ginkgo biloba for cognitive impairment and dementia. Image Credit: Gondronx Studio / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, researchers evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo) for individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia. The review analyzed data from 82 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 10,613 participants, with 72 studies providing extractable outcome data; however, not all outcomes were suitable for quantitative pooling. The review aimed to elucidate ginkgo's impact on memory, cognitive function, and daily routine task performance.

Review findings revealed that ginkgo offers little to no benefit for those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or multiple sclerosis-related cognitive impairment. While the authors noted small to moderate benefits for patients already diagnosed with dementia, the review highlights significant heterogeneity in study outcomes, emphasizing the need for standardized future protocols. Evidence for dementia benefits is of low certainty, and some analyses have shown very high statistical heterogeneity across trials.

Dementia is an umbrella term for a spectrum of progressive neurocognitive disorders characterized by significant declines in memory, thinking, behavior, and cognitive function that often hamper routine life.

The condition is increasingly recognized as a global health crisis, especially as advancements in modern medicine have led to projections of 1.4 billion people aged 60 and older by 2030. Despite decades of research, dementia and other forms of cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have no scientifically validated cure or clearly established disease-modifying therapy.

Current interventions aim to prevent dementia onset through risk assessment and delay progression once clinically diagnosed. Consequently, many individuals seek alternative remedies in traditional folk medicine and media-popularized cures. Among the most popular is Ginkgo biloba, ginkgo, an extract from one of the oldest extant tree species.

Modern medicine typically uses a standardized extract known as EGb 761, which contains specific bioactive compounds, flavonoids, and terpene lactones. These compounds are believed to act as antioxidants, reduce brain inflammation, and protect neurons from damage, making the plant and its extracts biologically plausible candidates for treating cognitive disorders, although this Cochrane review evaluated clinical outcomes rather than mechanistic effects.

Despite widespread use as an over-the-counter supplement, scientific evidence for ginkgo's effectiveness remains inconsistent, necessitating an updated synthesis of its potential cognitive benefits.

This Cochrane systematic review synthesized trial evidence on ginkgo's efficacy across a large, diverse pooled sample. Review data were obtained through searches of major medical databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, and were updated in November 2024 to include multiple trial registries and regional databases.

The review focused on RCTs investigating ginkgo supplementation in adults with subjective cognitive complaints, MCI, dementia, or multiple sclerosis-related cognitive problems rather than exclusively older adults.

The final analysis included 82 studies with 10,613 participants, including people with subjective memory complaints, multiple sclerosis, MCI, and diagnosed dementia, such as Alzheimer's or vascular dementia.

The primary endpoints included global clinical status, an overall clinician-rated impression of change in health or functioning, global cognitive function assessed using standard tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognition (ADAS-Cog), activities of daily living (ADLs), and safety based on adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Analyses suggested that baseline health status altered ginkgo's apparent efficacy. For participants with multiple sclerosis-related cognitive impairment, ginkgo's effects were not statistically distinguishable from placebo, with moderate-certainty evidence of little or no cognitive benefit.

Similarly, among 1,913 participants with MCI, ginkgo did not show a significant advantage over placebo at six months, with moderate-certainty evidence indicating little or no meaningful improvement in global clinical status, cognition, or daily functioning.

In contrast, participants with a formal dementia diagnosis showed improved global clinical status and cognitive function, and a slightly improved ability to perform daily tasks compared with the placebo group. However, evidence certainty was low, results varied widely between trials, longer-term data beyond about six months were limited, and current evidence does not demonstrate disease-modifying effects, only possible symptomatic benefit.

Safety assessments found no significant increase in adverse event risk compared with placebo in MCI and dementia populations. One short trial in people with subjective cognitive complaints suggested adverse events may occur more frequently with ginkgo, and evidence for serious adverse events remains uncertain.

This review synthesizes randomized trial evidence and concludes that while ginkgo is not a preventive “magic pill” for cognitive decline in healthy or mildly impaired individuals, it may provide modest symptomatic improvement for people living with dementia based on low-certainty evidence and heterogeneous results.

The review highlights substantial heterogeneity across RCTs and emphasizes the need for standardized methodologies and longer-term trials to identify which patients, such as those with Alzheimer's versus vascular dementia, are most likely to benefit from supplementation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Brainstem nerve cells found to stabilize blood pressure fluctuations","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260219/Brainstem-nerve-cells-found-to-stabilize-blood-pressure-fluctuations.aspx","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 14:50:00 GMT","

Doctors usually focus on a person's average blood pressure, but research increasingly shows that how much blood pressure fluctuates from moment to moment is just as important. Excessive short-term variability is a strong and independent predictor of heart disease, stroke and brain injury.

A group in University of Virginia School of Medicine's Department of Pharmacology has identified a group of nerve cells in the brainstem – a region that controls vital automatic functions – that act as a stabilizing system for blood pressure. The new research suggests these cells help prevent fluctuations when the body shifts between everyday activities such as sleeping, waking up, standing or exercising.

What we found is that a loss of just a few hundred nerve cells leads to unstable blood pressure even though the mean blood pressure was normal. This shows that the system that keeps blood pressure steady from moment to moment is no longer working.""

Stephen Abbott, PhD, lead investigator of the study, UVA

Loss or dysfunction of these same brain cells has already been documented in people with multiple system atrophy, a rare and fatal neurological disease related to Parkinson's disease that is marked by severe blood pressure problems. The findings suggest that similar brain-based mechanisms could contribute to blood pressure instability in other conditions where average blood pressure appears normal by standard measurements. The findings could open the door to treatments to stabilize blood pressure and prevent those harmful effects.

""Our work emphasizes a new appreciation for how we think about blood pressure problems,"" Abbott said. ""It's not just about lowering the numbers – it's about keeping blood pressure stable from moment to moment.""

Abbott and his colleagues have published their blood pressure findings in the scientific journal Circulation Research. The research team consisted of George M.P.R. Souza, Harsha Thakkalapally, Faye E. Berry, Leah F. Wisniewski, Ulrich M. Atongazi, Daniel S. Stornetta and Abbott. The scientists have no financial interest in the work.

The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, grant HL148004.

Finding new ways to understand and treat the most complex and challenging medical conditions is a primary mission for UVA's new Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. The institute aims to accelerate how quickly lab discoveries can be translated into lifesaving new treatments for patients.

ATLANTA (Feb. 18, 2026) – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team will face Puerto Rico, Haiti and Bermuda in Group B in the Final Round of the 2026 Concacaf Women's Under-17 Qualifiers. The Final Round of qualifiers will be held between March 17-22, 2026, at the Costa Rican Football Federation headquarters in San Rafael, Alajuela.

This is the second year of this Concacaf qualifying format for the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. With the world championship now staged annually and expanded from 16 to 24 nations, instead of a tournament in which the top three Concacaf finishers qualify for the Women's U-17 World Cup, 12 teams were drawn into three groups of four teams each with the winner of each group and the best second place team qualifying for the World Cup, set for October-November 2026 in Morocco.

The Concacaf U-17 Women's Qualifiers format includes two rounds: Round One and the Final Round. For Round One, 28 nations – all ranked fifth and below based on the Concacaf U-17 Women's Ranking – were split into six groups. After round-robin play between January 24 and February 2, eight teams progressed to the Final Round, joining the Confederation's four best-ranked teams.

The Final Round will also be played in a group format with three groups of four teams each. The 12 participating teams are: Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States who were all pre-seeded; Dominican Republic, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, which were the six Round One group winners; and Bermuda and Nicaragua, which were the best second-place finishers in Round One.

The other two groups feature Canada, El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua in Group A and Mexico, host Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica in Group C.

With the expanded annual U-17 Women's World Cup, the Concacaf region has been allocated an additional fourth berth. The next four editions of the tournament will be held in Morocco.

Last year's change in format means the USA can no longer win a Concacaf U-17 Women's Championship, of which it has won six and the most recent four in a row. The USA won the Concacaf U-17 Women's Championship in 2008, 2012, 2016, 2018, 2022 and 2024.

Just three countries thus far have qualified for the 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. In addition to host Morocco, New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via 2025 OFC U-16 Women's Championship.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Sofia Cantore, Lucia Di Guglielmo and Le Azzurre to take on Sweden and Denmark in two qualifiers for 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup

Washington, D.C. (02/19/2026) – Washington Spirit forward Sofia Cantore and defender Lucia Di Guglielmo have been called up to the Italy Women's National Team for the side's upcoming matches, the Italian Football Federation announced this week. Le Azzurre will host Sweden and Denmark in two qualifiers for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup in early March.

Originally from Lecco, Lombardy in northern Italy, Cantore has appeared in over 45 international matches and scored five goals for the Italy senior team, making her debut for the squad in December 2020. Since joining the Spirit in August 2025, Cantore has appeared in 18 matches for the team, tallying five goals and an assist.

Di Guglielmo hails from Pisa near Tuscany's Ligurian Sea coast and has been a mainstay of the Italian women's national team since making her senior debut in 2021 at 23 years old. The defender has appeared for Italy at two UEFA Women's Euro tournaments (2022, 2025) and one FIFA Women's World Cup (2023). Di Guglielmo joined the Spirit this offseason and is poised to make her NWSL debut this season.

Italy's March Schedule: 

The Spirit will look to build on the side's second consecutive NWSL Championship appearance in 2026. The team will kick off the regular season at home on Friday, March 13 when it hosts Portland Thorns FC in a rematch of last season's thrilling home semifinal.

Tiger Rag News Services

Former LSU Soccer defender Sydney Cheesman has earned a call-up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team, announced by the U.S. Soccer Federation on Wednesday.

Cheesman is one of 24 players that have been called up to the first U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp of 2026, which will run from Feb. 27 to March 7 in South Florida.



U.S. U-23 WNT head coach Heather Dyche will train a squad featuring 21 professional players – 19 from the NWSL and two from the USL Super League – along with three current collegiate players.

The camp will end with two matches against the Mexico U-23 Women's National Team, on March 3 at Noon ET and March 6 at 2 p.m. ET, both at the FIU Soccer Stadium in Miami. The matches are open and free to the public.

Cheesman's selection marks another milestone for LSU Soccer, as the program continues to produce talent at the national level. The U-23 Women's National Team serves as a key pipeline to the senior national team, featuring some of the top emerging players in the country.

The selection marks LSU Soccer's third Tiger to earn a national team call-up just this week. Previously, current freshman Sariyah Bailey received a call-up to the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team, while former Tiger and teammate of Cheesman, Ida Hermannsdottir, got named to the full Icelandic Women's National Team.

Cheesman concluded her LSU career in 2025 as a cornerstone of the Tigers' backline, being a vital piece of the squad that led the program to its first-ever NCAA Sweet 16 appearance. Over her two seasons in Baton Rouge, she appeared in 44 matches, earning the start in all but one of those, and logged 3,557 minutes on the pitch. In addition to her defensive contributions, Cheesman tallied two goals and seven assists during her time in the Purple and Gold.

After transferring to LSU in 2024, Cheesman quickly established herself as a vital piece of the Tigers' defense, bringing experience, consistency and leadership to the squad. Her impact was instrumental in LSU's historic 2025 season, as the team set new benchmarks on the national stage.

The U-23 call-up reflects Cheesman's continued development and recognition among the nation's elite young players. She will now have the opportunity to compete and train at the international level as part of the U.S. Soccer system.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","SSFC Spotlight: Jacob Bartlett heads into sophomore MLS season","https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/athletes-in-focus/42481/ssfc-spotlight-jacob-bartlett-heads-into-sophomore-season","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 14:00:00 GMT","

The midfielder-defender had an intriguing rookie year.

The 2026 season of Major League Soccer is set to begin, with the next crop of talent ready to enter into the limelight. During the past few months of the previous campaign, several potentially interesting players emerged, taking a big step forward in their careers with regular appearances and noticeable development. Jacob Bartlett had a solid rookie campaign and forced himself into the starting lineup, displaying composure as a passer. The 20-year-old Sporting Kansas City midfielder-defender could be an intriguing name to watch moving forward.

Born in Overland Park, Kansas, Bartlett competed with Sporting Blue Valley before joining the Sporting Kansas City Academy in the Under-12 age group and progressing all the way up to the Under-19 side. He was a member of the teams that won the 2019 LA Galaxy Cup, finished in second place at the 2020 US Youth Futsal National Championships, and claimed a 2023 United Premier Soccer League regular season division title. Top Drawer Soccer listed him as a four-star recruit and a top-50 prospect in the country.

“(He) came to work every day, worked really hard, put maximum focus, maximum effort, maximum energy every day, every time he was at the facility,” said academy director Declan Jogi. “He thrived on the technical elements of the game and he loved the technical work. And he threw himself into it. I think you see that now on the field: The first touch and his passing ability is elite. It's exceptional.”

Following a growth spurt, Bartlett was included in Sporting Kansas City's 2023 and 2024 preseason rosters, “training extensively with the first team.” He then made a single appearance with the reserves in MLS NEXT Pro, playing 67 minutes at centre-back in a 3-2 loss to FC Cincinnati II. During the next season, his number was called seven consecutive times to start the schedule on a 4-2-1 run, with the midfielder-defender nabbing an assist in a 4-1 victory over Minnesota United II.

Bartlett then matriculated to the University of Notre Dame for a brief spell, which provided the opportunity to “get out of [his] comfort zone, experience a new system, meet new players, and push [himself] in different ways.” He picked up 16 total appearances, registering the game-winning goal with a blasted shot in a 2-1 win over Louisville. The Atlantic Coast Conference named him the Defensive Player of the Week in September after picking up his first start of the season and being “instrumental” at left fullback.

Following his single collegiate campaign, Bartlett made the “easy” decision to leave school in order to achieve his dream. Sporting Kansas City signed him to a Homegrown Player contract through 2027 with options for 2028 and 2029, highlighting his ability to “adjust to different game situations.” He was with the first team to open the schedule, starting both matches and playing all 180 minutes in a 4-1 (1-0, 3-1) aggregate defeat to Inter Miami in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, registering an assist in the away leg — his “excellent” performances and immediate adaptation to the professional level impressed observers.

Facing off against a star-studded roster for his professional debut was a trial by fire for the young player. “My parents reassured me that I deserve to be here, this is the moment that I've been dreaming of, and I just need to go take it,” Bartlett said on No Other Pod. “I got to the stadium; definitely the nerves, they went up a notch for sure… It's a confidence thing. If I'm settling into the game and know I can play, I guess the adrenaline builds my confidence out. In the heat of the game, I feel like the emotion takes me away, in a good way… In those moments you see [my] fiery side.”

Bartlett made a further 31 league and cup appearances, mostly in the starting lineup before becoming a substitute in the latter portion of the schedule and added another helper in a 4-2 win over the Colorado Rapids. The club endured a dismal campaign despite firing long-tenured manager Peter Vermes in March, finishing at the bottom of MLS' Western Conference with a 7-20-7 record. With a roster overhaul underway, the young midfielder is expected to be a key figure in 2026.

Standing at a rangy six feet, two inches tall, Bartlett is a versatile player who can line up at centre-back, fullback, and defensive midfielder, covering a fair amount of ground. He is an active part of the build-up and plays several long-range passes every match while also racking up interceptions in crucial areas, praised for “a very good confidence, playing the position well, [having] a good touch, and [having] a good understanding of the game.” The “very cerebral player” is a quick study and overcomes his mistakes, enjoying rapid progress after entering MLS in a state of physical readiness.

“I'd love to keep playing and build minutes as time goes on,” Bartlett shared with RG. “I'm chasing my next contract because nothing is guaranteed. I don't know what'll happen tomorrow, but I can show up every day with the same mentality and work ethic and let the rest follow... I'm trying to stay level-headed. It's that inner drive to get better every day. I'm aggressive—I try to win the ball back quickly—and I use my stamina to keep up. Whether it's distributing… or stopping a counterattack, I'll do whatever helps the team win.”

Bartlett had a solid first season in MLS, entering the professional level with some extra seasoning after two campaigns with the reserves and a brief spell in college. The next few years are crucial for his development and prospects, particularly if there is to be an eventual transfer overseas or international future. He will have to continue to perform and improve in order to earn a shot with the United States Men's National Team, but there will be plenty of chances during the next few World Cup cycles.

Clubs who did not play are to get solidarity payments

No formula determined for dividing the money

Frustration is growing among clubs globally at the extended wait for £185m of solidarity payments promised by Fifa on the back of last summer's Club World Cup.

Clubs that did not participate in the tournament were promised a share of the sum, designed to ensure a proportion of the event's funding was distributed throughout the football pyramid. If shared equally it would amount to about £50,000 for every top-flight club in the world but, more than seven months after the Club World Cup's conclusion, there is no sign of the money and no timescale for its distribution. The Guardian understands Fifa is yet to determine how the money will be allocated.

There is no suggestion that the windfall will go unpaid but clubs in smaller leagues are growing particularly impatient. The £740m set aside as prize money is understood to have been released; the winners, Chelsea, are thought to have earned about £84m. In comparison the solidarity sum may seem a drop in the ocean but the cash injection would make a significant difference to those in less glamorous settings.

An executive from one of Europe's smaller leagues told the Guardian there had been no clear answers about when their clubs will be paid despite continued inquiries. In environments where domestic television rights deals are increasingly precarious, and in certain cases nonexistent, a five-figure windfall has the potential to be a lifeline.

Numerous clubs, including some on other continents, have painted a similar picture. In Europe there is a perception that Fifa has dragged its feet on reaching a final formula for the payments' distribution. On some occasions Fifa is believed to have postponed meetings on the topic. Fifa has been in dialogue for several months with the powerful European Football Clubs body, which reached an agreement last year for about 13% of Club World Cup revenue to be reserved for solidarity payments. In some quarters there is sympathy for Fifa, acknowledging the complexity and political sensitivity of the task.

One sticking point is that no formula has been determined for dividing the £185m between the six confederations, who were represented at the Club World Cup to wildly differing extents. In practice, clubs are highly unlikely to receive identical amounts. Additionally, most confederations do not have a mechanism for distributing such payments. Uefa has experience of handing out solidarity funds to clubs that do not qualify for the league phase of European club competitions and is likely to employ a similar formula when the final sums are known.

Fifa sources said they were in regular discussions with the confederations and clubs about how the money will be distributed, and that they wanted all stakeholders to benefit from what they regard as successful tournament.

A source from the Union of European Clubs (UEC), which represents more than 140 non-elite clubs around Europe, said none of its members had received any information about when payments might be received. “UEC as an organisation has not heard anything and no member clubs we have consulted with have heard anything either,” they said.

The last-minute nature of Fifa's funding deal for the Club World Cup is unlikely to have helped the process to run quickly. It was only in March, three months before the tournament, that the prize money and solidarity pots were agreed. That followed the £787m agreement with the Saudi-backed streaming platform Dazn, reached in December 2024, to air all the competition's games free of charge.

by Martina Alcheva February 19, 2026

The build-up to the 2026 World Cup has already turned into a global spectacle, not only on the pitch but also at the ticket office. Supporters across the world have reacted with disbelief as prices for the expanded tournament in North America reached unprecedented levels, sparking accusations of profiteering, frustration among loyal fans, and renewed debates over access to soccer's biggest stage. Amid the storm, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has remained a central figure in defending the tournament's commercial model, while insisting that demand has never been higher.

The debate is unfolding as the club and the national team prepare for the most ambitious World Cup in history, with 48 teams, 104 matches, and a tri-nation hosting format involving the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Ticket pricing has emerged as one of the most controversial topics, with fans claiming the tournament is becoming inaccessible for ordinary supporters.

The controversy intensified after resale listings revealed staggering prices for major matches. Tickets for the opening match in Mexico City were listed at more than $5,300, compared with an original price of $895, while a single seat for the final in New Jersey reached a jaw-dropping $143,750 — more than 40 times its original value. Even the cheapest resale ticket for the final hovered close to $10,000, shocking supporters around the world.

Fan organizations accused FIFA of betraying its core audience, arguing that soccer's biggest tournament is drifting further away from ordinary supporters. “These exorbitant prices, unfortunately, don't surprise me… In the end, who pays the price? The passionate fans who end up with outrageous offers,” said France supporters' group Irresistibles Francais. “We would prefer that this benefit real fans… but unfortunately, that's not the case.”

FIFA attempted to soften the backlash by introducing a $60 “Supporter Entry Tier” ticket, but critics argued that the limited allocation — just 10% of tickets distributed through national associations — was symbolic rather than transformative.

While supporters questioned affordability, Infantino insisted the World Cup was witnessing historic demand, hinting that the tournament was on course to be one of the most attended sporting events in history. His comments fueled debate about whether soccer's popularity could truly offset concerns about accessibility and fairness.

In the middle of the controversy, the head of the international governing body delivered a striking declaration. “The demand is there. Every match is sold out,” he said in an interview with CNBC.

According to the FIFA president, 508 million ticket requests were submitted in just four weeks for roughly seven million available tickets, with applications coming from more than 200 countries. “We've never seen anything like that — incredible,” he added, noting that FIFA deliberately kept some tickets in reserve for a final sales phase starting in April and running until the final on July 19.

Infantino also addressed the pricing criticism directly, suggesting that the tournament's location was a major driver of demand. “I think it is because it's in America, Canada, and Mexico. Everybody wants to be part of something special,” he said. He explained that although official ticket prices are fixed, dynamic pricing models and resale platforms allow prices to fluctuate based on market demand, adding, “That's part of the market we are in.”

Beyond ticket sales, Infantino painted a picture of unprecedented economic impact. He estimated the tournament would generate more than $11 billion in revenue for FIFA, claiming “every dollar” would be reinvested in soccer across its 211 member associations.

He also projected that the World Cup could contribute around $30 billion to the US economy, driven by tourism, catering, security, and infrastructure investments. In addition, between 20 and 30 million tourists are expected, alongside 185,000 full-time jobs created by the event. “It's a big impact… I hope this impact will not just be limited to the World Cup but for the future as well,” Infantino said.

“Football will win,” said Nasser Al-Khelaifi (below), the chairman of football's reigning European champions, Paris Saint-Germain, and one of football's most powerful administrators, as he addressed UEFA's Congress in Brussels last week.

At the annual powwow of Europe's great and good, UEFA, Real Madrid and the EFC - formerly the ECA,  chaired by Qatar's Al-Khelaifi - had just signed an agreement, signalling Real Madrid's retreat from the ill-conceived Super League and the reintegration of the Bernabeu club into the European football family.

It was a curious moment. Real Madrid briefed that they had won. UEFA's president, Aleksander Ceferin, echoed Al-Khelaifi's words and said that football was the winner. From Florentino Perez to the ubiquitous Gianni Infantino, the “football family” demonstrated more unity than ever.

In a dense statement, the three parties wrote that they had “reached an agreement of principles for the well-being of European club football, respecting the principle of sporting merit with emphasis on long-term club sustainability and the enhancement of fan experience through the use of technology.

“This agreement of principles will also serve to resolve their legal disputes related to the European Super League, once such principles are executed and implemented.”

What did that even mean? Real Madrid's return was framed as the ultimate collapse of the Super League, but few at the UEFA Congress were willing to shine a light on the finer details of the agreement. 

A senior UEFA official indicated to Sporting Intelligence that Real Madrid had gained little. They had become isolated, even if the club's longstanding boss Florentino Perez had been one of the main drivers of the Super League project.

They have returned to the European establishment in different circumstances. The EFC and the joint venture that the EFC now have with UEFA - which is called UC3 - call the shots in the continental club game. 

UEFA's annual financial report discloses as much, saying: “We also transferred the management, sale and delivery of all media, sponsorship and licensing rights to our elite men's and women's club competitions to UC3, a UEFA-EFC joint venture.”

Real Madrid and the other elite clubs can therefore now lobby from the inside for any future reformatting of the Champions League. Sources say that one reformatting proposal is that the current 36-team group phase becomes a “two division” phase, with the “biggest” clubs in one 18-team league, and “the rest” in another 18-team league, with more teams from the “big clubs” pool getting to the last 16 than from the “other” pool.

It should be stressed: this is all up for grabs and proposals remain in their infancy. But the bottom line is that Europe's “biggest” clubs - Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, and the major clubs from the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A will have enhanced chances of success, and crucially, enhanced chances of making more money, under any reformatted version of the CL.

The EFC currently takes €25m from UEFA annually, as first reported by The Independent. Those funds, it is understood, come from UEFA club competitions. On page 29, UEFA's 2024-25 financial report discloses: “€25m was allocated to European Football Clubs (EFC) in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed by UEFA and EFC.” 

In total, over the course of multiple seasons, an estimated €96m has flown from UEFA to the EFC. With this cash going to the EFC rather than to clubs who might (should) have earned it via European competition, it means lots of clubs have lost out on income.

Aston Villa (€631,000) and Celtic (€1.2m) are among dozens and dozens of clubs to miss out on extra revenue because of the money going to the EFC from UEFA. In the 2024-25 season, Scotland's Heart of Midlothian missed out on €43,000 through their participation in the Conference League while Arsenal, the losing semi-finalists in the Champions League, lost out on €883,000.

FootballGroundGuide » Latest Football Stadium and Fan News » “A truly horrible experience” – MetLife Stadium slammed by fans ahead of hosting 2026 World Cup final

18+ | Commercial Content | T&Cs apply | Gambleaware.org

Ahead of hosting the 2026 World Cup final, MetLife Stadium has faced a fresh wave of criticism from fans and observers, who say the venue offers a hugely underwhelming experience. 

As the spotlight turns to New Jersey this July, many supporters are already airing serious concerns online about the stadium.

While the stadium will stage the tournament's showcase match, alongside several group and knockout ties involving major nations like England, backlash highlights perceived problems with accessibility and atmosphere. 

Social posts have called out the venue's car-centric layout, arguing it's far from ideal for a global football final. Critics also say travel logistics, including limited pedestrian-friendly access and transport links, could leave travelling supporters frustrated rather than thrilled.

It doesn't even rank in the top 10 best-rated stadiums for the 2026 World Cup, according to Google Reviews.

One fan summed up their experience in stark terms: “I remember one night that was impossible to walk to the parking lot… that stadium is a huge mess.” 

Meanwhile, journalist Sid Lowe – who attended multiple Club World Cup fixtures – bluntly commented: “A truly horrible experience.” 

My 2 pennies' worth (largely irrelevant I know but, hey, that's twitter) … was at the MetLife last summer for CWC and it is genuinely, surprisingly shit. A truly horrible experience. I hope, but don't expect, that some of the lessons from last summer have been learnt. https://t.co/rc404U3FNv

Recent discussions on forums also describe post-event chaos and cramped concourses, warning that what might be normal in American sporting culture clashes with what many international fans expect.

Some even labelled the MetLife as a “generic venue without charm,” with few elements that feel connected to football's rich history, unlike traditional World Cup settings and iconic grounds like the Camp Nou or Wembley Stadium.

It's clearly not good news for MetLife to be trending for all the wrong reasons, barely months before the final. 

While every major venue has its critics, the intensity of negative reaction, from both visiting fans and locals, should serve as a wake-up call for FIFA ahead of them taking over the stadium in May.

If the organisers, local hosts and transit planners can heed these warnings and address key concerns from the Club World Cup now, then it could improve the experience for supporters arriving from around the world. 

But as things stand, hearing words like “horrible” about the host of football's biggest match this year is far from ideal.

Vinicius Jr

Incident

As the scope and significance of the Champions League match between Benfica and Real Madrid became clear on Tuesday evening, the two men in charge of CBS Sports' coverage made a decision.

Pete Radovich, the coordinating producer of the broadcaster's UCL Today show, and line producer Matt Curtis decided the post-match section should run longer than its usual slot of around an hour, extending it a further 30 minutes to end shortly after 6.30pm ET.

The call was made because Thierry Henry, Micah Richards and Jamie Carragher, the show's pundits, had lucid thoughts and raw feelings they needed to share. They were speaking in the aftermath of the Madrid forward Vinicius Jr's allegation that he had been racially abused by Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni. The Argentine subsequently denied this, and was defended by his club, but the matter is now the subject of a UEFA investigation.

In these moments, as the world's gaze fixes on the Champions League, CBS increasingly dominates the global conversation. Across Tuesday and Wednesday night, clips from UCL Today combined for over 20 million views across platforms, but also set the tenor of the debate across the English-speaking world.

It is, in many ways, a curious phenomenon. It is only available to viewers in the United States (via the CBS Sports Network and the Paramount+ streaming platform) and, in truth, it is not the most convenient slot in the week for many Americans.

As Champions League games take place in the European evenings, it translates to various times in the afternoon in the U.S. depending on one's location within the country. Many people are still in their workplace, others are commuting by the time matches end at around 5pm ET, but it is a good time for children returning home from school, especially on the east coast. The precise numbers of people who actually watch the matches are not often disclosed, a common trait across streaming platforms.

Yet while this is a show made for a U.S. audience, in many ways modelled on Inside the NBA, its reach and influence are much broader. That, in itself, is a strange and remarkable thing, because any match action itself is geoblocked, meaning CBS Sports cannot share its match analysis on social media outside of the United States.

Yet this show's unique blend of hi-jinks, sincere friendship and agenda-setting discussion means that the action is not a required ingredient for global virality.

UCL Today, it should be said, is not always to everyone's taste. One viewer's ‘fun' may be another's roll of the eyes, and it is true that some of the show's most-viewed content on YouTube includes a guest appearance by IShowSpeed and a compilation of schoolboy giggles about the club from the French city of Brest who played in the Champions League last season.



But it is perhaps because the show is so often light-hearted that it then becomes appointment viewing when the most serious matters come into play.

The sudden solemnity that gripped the four protagonists — Henry, Richards, Carragher and host Kate Scott — on Tuesday evening was striking, with much of the post-game show reserved for news, reaction and discussion from the game in Lisbon.

CBS Sports demonstrated the importance of investing in a product, because the post-match position taken up by pitchside reporter Guillem Balague illuminated the tensions between Benfica and Madrid after the final whistle.

From his station near the locker rooms, viewers could see scuffles breaking out between rival club employees, with Benfica's president Rui Costa somewhere in the thick of it. Balague gamely requested an interview every time Costa passed by, albeit unrequited, and wondered whether UEFA would rather all this wasn't being filmed.

Broadcasters are not always so challenging when these events occur. At times, they see themselves less as information platforms and more as partners, or even advertisers, of the product they have acquired.

This was how it felt when DAZN broadcast the FIFA Club World Cup last summer and supplied little immediate analysis or scrutiny after Real Madrid's Antonio Rudiger alleged he was racially abused in a game against Pachuca of Mexico (that case was ultimately dropped due to a lack of evidence). Yet that has never been the approach on UCL Today. Memorably, during the Champions League final in 2022, the CBS studio team, led by Scott and Carragher, challenged the UEFA narrative by revealing the mistreatment endured by Liverpool fans who were attempting to attend the match against Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris.

A word on this occasion, too, for Clive Tyldesley, the experienced 71-year-old British commentator. Both he and co-commentator Rob Green handled the event with calm authority. They did not rush to make judgments. They used an old trick: simply saying what they could see.

“You can see what Vinicius Jr wants to happen here,” Tyldesley said as the Brazilian exited the pitch following the incident with Prestianni. “He wants everybody off the field because if he has been racially abused, this takes this moment to a whole different level.”

By contrast, former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg issued a statement to apologize on Wednesday after saying on Amazon Prime's UK coverage that Vinicius had “not helped himself”.

“I got it wrong, I'm sorry,” Clattenburg wrote. “It was live TV, my job is to respond in the moment, and the words I used were clumsy and not right.”

Tyldesley instead pointed out that Prestianni had been smiling, but warned that it would be the “content” of what was said from behind the shirt collar the Benfica player had used to cover his mouth that would define the moment. “Somewhere in the midst of his celebrations, something has been said to him (Vinicius) that has raised his temperature beyond boiling point,” he added.

Opinion was largely deferred to those in the CBS studio.

Henry, usually a beacon of cool, appeared highly affected, transported back to past traumas from his own playing career at teams including Arsenal, Barcelona and the French national team.

""People did fight, way before my time, for us to be able to perform… and to be in 2026 talking about the same thing, it's tiring.

— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2026



Both he and Richards, as former Black professional footballers, knew the script. They empathized with the isolation that grips those who have encountered abuse. They also knew that the intricacies of the moment — most specifically that Prestianni had covered his mouth — may complicate any investigation. They knew some form of victim-blaming would ensue.

“I can relate to what Vinicius Jr is going through,” said Henry. “I've been there, I feel so sorry for the guy. That happened to me so many times on the field. I've been also accused of looking for excuses after games when that happened to me. At times, you feel lonely, because it's going to be your word against his word… You feel like you don't know what to do anymore.”

Richards veered between anger and an air of resignation. “The one that gets me is, like, ‘Oh, they're playing the race card again?' What do you mean, playing the race card? It's so difficult to talk about and articulate how you feel to someone who does not believe or feel what you feel at the time.”

He continued: “Prestianni is a coward… No one will ever know what he said, only him and Vinicius Jr. But to pull your shirt over your mouth and now we're having a conversation about, ‘Did it happen?'”

In this instance, Carragher's strength was his self-awareness. He recognized the power of saying less when his Black colleagues could say so much more. Henry and Richards had the lived experience and were best placed to take center-stage.

Carragher came into his own on the following day's show, reflecting on his own experience as a player at Liverpool when that club rallied in support of his Uruguayan team-mate Luis Suarez after Manchester United's Patrice Evra had accused the forward of racially abusing him. Carragher apologized to Evra for Liverpool's behaviour years later while presenting for UK broadcaster Sky Sports, acknowledging that Liverpool had got things “completely wrong”.

— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 18, 2026



He also intervened on Tuesday night after Benfica head coach Jose Mourinho appeared to suggest that Vinicius Jr., in some way, invites trouble by expressively celebrating his goals.

“Anybody can celebrate how they like and you should not get racially abused for it,” Carragher said. “The Mourinho stuff… this is a guy who celebrates and antagonises the opposition more than any coach has ever done… It's a bit rich coming from him. Vinicius is entitled to celebrate how he likes.”

By this point, Richards appeared deflated: “I'm just disappointed with the whole thing. Mourinho is someone I absolutely love as a coach… I expect better from him, because he is a powerful person within the sport and a lot of people listen to what he says. I just feel a little bit let down.”

Amid high tensions, Scott chaired proceedings with trademark skill, cutting between what was being said in the London studio and the stadium in Lisbon. She also provided live, second-by-second translations into English for the viewers of highly newsworthy interviews by Mourinho and Vinicius Jr's French team-mate Kylian Mbappe. With sensitivities spiking, the potential for legal difficulties in any misrepresentation of those post-game interviews, and all the pressures of live television, Scott's performance cannot be underestimated.

On Wednesday, in the cold light of day, Scott opened the show with a monologue which, by midnight ET, had recorded almost 1.5 million views on Twitter and Instagram alone.

“Jose Mourinho is an iconic figure in world football,” Scott said. “Yesterday, he switched the focus from what had actually been said to whether there was provocation for it. He essentially told us that Vinicius Jr was asking for it. That is a damaging narrative from a man who is considered a leading figure in the global game.

“Investigation and due process will have to occur, but whatever the results, we hope that football becomes a better platform, where hatred is met with more than nominal fines and partial stadium closures, where diversity is truly celebrated not just tolerated.

“The racial diversity on a football pitch in the Champions League is the representation of the global love for this game, and the global belonging in this game. This is the very spirit of football. And if you don't agree, then respectfully, you are the one who doesn't belong.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Is the World Cup bump real? MLS is going to find out","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/19/world-cup-bump-mls","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:17:00 GMT","

MLS stakeholders want to turn the interest in this summer's North American World Cup into ‘rocket fuel' for the league. Are those realistic expectations?

In 1988, a full eight years before Major League Soccer debuted, it got its first “World Cup bump”.

Fifa had just awarded the 1994 World Cup to the United States, but there was a stipulation. The US could host the tournament, but only if there was a competitive club league in place by the time it rolled around, something that hadn't been true since the North American Soccer League collapsed in 1985. Tournament organisers missed that 1994 deadline, but two years later, MLS became a reality. Thirty years on, it is still here.

MLS was in every way, shape and form a byproduct of that World Cup. Executives lured some of the tournament's standout players to the league and ensured that many of its 10 teams were stocked with the US national team's biggest names. It's no exaggeration to suggest that MLS would not have been created without the tournament, and that it never would've survived without the initial excitement created by that World Cup.

That particular World Cup bump was transformative, and every four years since, minds all over the American soccer landscape have attempted to capitalize on that very same idea: that the coming World Cup, which drives millions of non-soccer fans and casual viewers to the game, will lead to a surge in interest in MLS.

With the tournament coming to the United States this summer for the first time in the league's history, MLS executives and cheerleaders have taken a particular interest in maximizing the World Cup's effect. Commissioner Don Garber has frequently suggested the tournament will be a major catalyst in the growth of his league and the game as a whole in the US.

“The next decade will redefine what's possible for MLS and North American soccer,” Garber said in his “state of the league” address, this past December. “As the world turns towards North America, the 2026 World Cup will soon serve as rocket fuel for our entire ecosystem, and it will do so for MLS.”

If Garber's take feels lacking in detail, that's possibly by design. Though the commissioner has at times suggested that the idea of a World Cup bump is statistically proven – in one interview, he said research has found a 15-to-20% increase in domestic league interest off the World Cup – many studies have shown otherwise. Oftentimes, whatever marginal bump any given league has gotten off the back of any given tournament is impossible to divorce from other variables such as preexisting growth, planned expansion and increased investment.

It's a question worth asking ahead of what's been called the most pivotal moment in the history of American men's soccer: is the World Cup bump even real?

Few are more familiar with the phenomenon of the World Cup bump than University of Michigan professor Stefan Szymanski, who co-authored Soccernomics with British journalist Simon Kuper. The 2009 book, which has become a bit of a bible in its field, seems to get reprinted every World Cup, receiving a far more defined bump than any particular league.

In 2020, Szymanskii published the result of his research on the effects of a major tournament on a country's domestic league attendance, focusing on the World Cup and Euros from 1966 onwards. The research was exhaustive and detailed, and in the end did little to identify any conclusive truths surrounding the tournament's effect.

“[The data] varied significantly,” Szymanski told the Guardian. “Generally speaking the league attendance in host countries was already on an upward trajectory around the time when the international championship was hosted, and then there were different narratives.

“There was a ‘step jump' of sorts around the date of the event, which was true in various tournaments, and then an upward trend that was continuous across all seasons in other tournaments. Or one that starts around the time of the event. In several instances there was just a short-term spike.”

Other tournaments, such as the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and the 1984 Euros in France, had no effect whatsoever on league attendance. Some, such as the 2012 Euros in Poland and Ukraine and the 1990 World Cup in Italy, saw a decrease in post-tournament attendance.

“Generally speaking there is some observable trend which is not guaranteed, but possible in many cases,” said Szymanski. “And then the obvious question here is, what should we expect in the case of MLS?”

Garber and others are careful to frame a potential World Cup bump as being a boost in “relevance”, a nebulous metric open to interpretation. Focusing on attendance alone and leaving aside other factors, World Cups have generally proven positive for MLS. On average, attendance in the year after a World Cup has risen 9% throughout league history. In some cases, such as the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, the number remained more or less flat. In others it skyrocketed, as it did after the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.

The issue with using total or even average attendance as a barometer for the bump is the ever-changing nature of MLS itself. 2007 was not just the year after a World Cup in MLS. It was the year David Beckham arrived and fundamentally changed the league, and the year Toronto FC, a well-supported expansion franchise, debuted. 2011 saw the addition of the Vancouver Whitecaps and Portland Timbers, two of the most historically well-supported teams.

Relevance feels much harder to measure than attendance, but league executives say they are focused on two specific metrics: brand interest and viewership, both in-person and via the league's broadcast partners.

“We have a sense of what we believe – with zero marketing investment – what we think the World Cup would do for us along those two metrics,” MLS chief marketing officer Radhika Duggal told the Guardian. “You have a baseline, and then you say ‘I'm going to do these eight things – my campaign is made up of these eight things, and we believe they will take our two metrics, for which we have quantifiable goals, and take them from the baseline to twice the baseline or whatever it is.”

MLS last week rolled out its 2026 advertising campaign, a year-long effort that Duggal describes as being a “fully unified” approach across the league and its clubs. For the first time in the league's history, Duggal said, most of MLS's clubs are working with the league on specific marketing campaigns, and the league is supplementing those campaigns with in-market events before, during and after the World Cup. The league and its clubs are reportedly making an eight-figure investment into marketing efforts this year, the largest marketing spend in league history.

“What we want consumers to really understand about us is that we are fun. It is super simple and super clear. The secondary thing we want consumers to understand about us is that we are welcoming. Anyone is welcome to experience us. That's it. Those are two really simple messages.”

“The one thing that we're trying to do [with all of this],” added Duggal, “the calls to action we're really focused on are ‘watch our matches'. It will be all about viewership and all about butts in seats at our stadiums, so that people can give us a try.”

Some 50 to 60 MLS players – Lionel Messi among them – will take part in the World Cup, which seems sure to give the league at least a short-term boost in brand awareness. It also feels certain enough that some fans, especially casuals, may turn to MLS after the World Cup ends in search of more soccer, whether they do so in person or on a screen.

“My feeling is that it's going to be a bit of a mess,” says Szymanski. “In some ways they're already more or less at capacity or close to capacity [in stadiums]. And the other thing is that they just don't have a television audience to sort of build and maintain momentum. In some ways what MLS needs is not more people going to games. What they need is more people watching it on TV.”

MLS is in the fourth season of its $2.5bn media rights partnership with Apple TV, which airs all of the league's matches. The league has tweaked its strategy with Apple this season, doing away with “MLS Season Pass”, the standalone subscription viewers needed to watch many MLS games on Apple TV. Despite this, nearly all of the league's matches remain behind a paywall and are largely unavailable on linear television.

Times have changed, of course, and many consumers won't even turn to traditional TV to begin with. Apple's streaming platform is massive, with an estimated 45 million subscribers worldwide as of 2025, giving the league ample opportunity to expose its product to the uninitiated.

And while the quality of play in MLS has grown exponentially in the last decade or so, there will likely still be a large drop-off between what a viewer sees at the World Cup and what they'll see when they tune in to watch Colorado Rapids v Houston Dynamo on a Wednesday night.

“That's the big question,” says Szymanski. “Will this generate new television audiences? I doubt it because the quality of play is so low. If you had the World Cup in England now, with the Premier League, that's comparable quality. If you had it in Spain or France or a lot of the other [more traditional footballing] countries, that would be true as well. It's not necessarily true in a place like the United States.”

The history of American soccer is full of tentpole events leagues and decision-makers have identified as catalysts for explosive growth. And while MLS's own history is dotted with significant events that pushed it along – the arrivals of Beckham or Messi, for example – its own trajectory towards stability and success has been much more tempered and gradual.

The language the league uses to talk about the World Cup has softened in recent weeks. In a conversation with Sports Business Journal this week, Garber seemed, for once, to forget the rocket fuel. Whether he intended to or not, his remarks seemed to temper some of the hyperbole league officials have employed for years now.

“I don't think that the energy behind investing in this sport, at all levels, has been driven by the World Cup,” Garber said. “The World Cup gives us something to rally around and a great moment of truth, which will break through lots of different things going on in our country. But MLS would've continued to grow without the World Cup, and will continue to grow after the World Cup. We will continue our focus on player development, investing in facilities, growing a fanbase, ensuring that our teams are embedded in their community and that players view us as a league of choice.”

After the World Cup, league executives won't have to look far to find the next big event they can circle. The 2028 Summer Olympics will be in Los Angeles, and the United States will co-host the women's World Cup three years later.

Neither of those events feels like rocket fuel, so to speak, and in many ways the 2026 World Cup doesn't either. MLS very badly needed its initial World Cup bump, which quite literally birthed it into existence. Three decades later, it could still use a boost in notoriety and quality.

This summer's World Cup may help, but it feels increasingly unlikely it will fundamentally change the trajectory of the league in any truly significant way.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

New Jersey is canceling a weeks-long World Cup festival at Liberty State Park in Jersey City and is instead allotting $5 million for fan-zone type experiences throughout the state, officials said Thursday.

The FIFA 2026 World Cup tournament is taking place in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and is expected to draw unprecedented interest in New Jersey. MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host eight soccer games, including the final game on July 19.

Viewing events will range from large public gatherings to small and mid-sized community watch parties, festivals and street fairs, according to an announcement from Gov. Mikie Sherrill.

“New Jersey is the beating heart of the 2026 World Cup, and this initiative makes sure that every New Jerseyan — no matter where they live — can be part of this once-in-a-generation moment,” Sherrill said in a statement provided by the governor's office.

The statement did not say why the original plan for a Liberty State Park celebration was abandoned.

Jersey City Mayor James Solomon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The statewide fan zone activities will be organized by the state Economic Development Authority in conjunction with the FIFA World Cup 26 New York New Jersey Host Committee. 

“The World Cup is an unparalleled opportunity to showcase New Jersey to the world and drive real economic impact for our businesses and communities,” said Evan Weiss, CEO of the state Economic Development Authority. 

“This initiative is about more than soccer — it's about making sure that the energy and investment generated by this global event flows directly to the small businesses, cultural organizations, and neighborhood nonprofits that are the backbone of our state,” Weiss said. 

Events will be announced in the coming weeks, officials said.

Dundee pubs will be allowed to remain open during Scotland's World Cup matches this summer.

The men's national team is heading to North America to compete in their first World Cup since 1998.

However, due to the time difference its first match against Haiti will not kick off until 02:00 UK time on 14 June and the following two games - against Morocco and Brazil - start at 23:00.

Dundee City Council's licensing committee has granted a general extension to pub opening hours during the competition.

Under the agreed terms, the extension will be in place between 11 June and 19 July.

For Scotland matches, pubs will be allowed to stay open for up to 30 minutes after full-time. This includes the Haiti match.

Pubs may open until 01:00 or 30 minutes after the end of matches kicking off at 23:00 – whichever is later.

The extension will apply to all premises with an on-sales licence, provided they have permission to show televised sport.

Earlier this week, North Ayrshire's licensing board decided not to introduce a general extension which would allow pubs and bars to remain open for the late-night screenings.

Instead, businesses will have to make individual applications to North Ayrshire licensing board to extend their opening hours.

It differs from the policy in Aberdeen, where a blanket 03:00 closing time has been approved, and Glasgow, where pubs will be able to remain open until 30 minutes after the final whistle.

When the Haitian men's soccer team qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, its first time since 1974, it did so without being able to play in its home stadium or train inside the beleaguered country.

""Which makes this achievement even more remarkable. We're very proud of this,"" said Regine Etienne, Haiti's acting consular general in Boston. ""Their journey demonstrates that there is still hope for Haiti, and that determination and talent can triumph despite adversity.""

Making the World Cup can have that kind of power for a small or troubled country. The Haitian flag will fly with those of some the world's most powerful nations. Haiti's citizens, however, will not be able to travel to the United States to cheer them on, a reality that stings for Haitians at home and in the diaspora. Haitians, like citizens from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Iran, face almost a complete travel ban under Trump Administration policy. Despite pleas from those countries, there is no indication President Donald Trump will relent, or that FIFA will pressure the U.S. to make an exception for those who want to travel to the World Cup.

As of Jan. 1, the Trump administration expanded its visa-issuance suspensions to nationals from 39 countries, citing national security and public safety concerns and saying the identified countries could not properly vet their citizens. Four of the countries on the banned list -- Haiti, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Iran -- have qualified for the World Cup, hosted this year by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Under the policy, known formally as Presidential Proclamation 10998, players, team officials and immediate family members from the four countries will be granted visas. While the policy allows for some other exceptions -- including those that ""would serve the U.S. national interest"" --  a State Department spokesman said in an email that those would be ""quite rare.""

""A visa is a privilege. Visas are not a right,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement ""Under President Trump, the Department of State is administering visa operations in a way that prioritizes the safety of the American people and our national interests, strengthens screening and vetting, and enforces the law.""

The Haitian government ""is actively exploring all possible options,"" Etienne said. But noted that, ""a visa is a sovereign prerogative and remains at the discretion of the relevant authorities.""

One hope for the four World Cup countries might be New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who had what observers found to be a surprisingly cordial Oval Office meeting with the Republican president in November.

Mamdani said in January that he would appeal to Trump for a travel exception for the World Cup. In a recent interview with ESPN, Mamdani would not say whether he had spoken to Trump -- ""I'll keep conversations between the president and myself private"" -- but said he intends to advocate for affected communities in any way he can.

""It is an opportunity to be seen by a world that often overlooks you. And I've heard, especially from Haitian New Yorkers, about what it means that their team is going to be a part of this World Cup, that it's a recognition of an entire people,"" Mamdani said, adding that he will ""always make the case"" that New York is ""a city that the world can visit.""

Mamdani, known for his love of soccer, hosted a watch party for the Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal last month, the first of what he says will be numerous events celebrating New York's immigrant communities.

A White House spokesman would not say whether the president had spoken to Mamdani or would consider a travel ban appeal, saying in an email, ""Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the FIFA World Cup 2026 will be one of the greatest and most spectacular events in the history of mankind, right here in the United States of America. This event will generate billions of dollars of economic impact and bring hundreds of thousands of jobs to our country. The President is focused on making this the greatest World Cup ever while ensuring it is the safest and most secure in history.""

Haiti, Senegal and Iran will play all their group-stage games in the United States. The Ivory Coast, on the other hand, plays its second group stage game in Toronto, where Canada has a strict vetting process but not a blanket ban. It's also possible that teams could advance to knockout games in Canada or Mexico, a long shot for all but Senegal.

Sheck Wes, a Senegalese-American hip hop artist raised in New York City, said the ban not only prohibits Senegalese tourists from sharing their passion with World Cup crowds, but also keeps other Americans from seeing a vibrant community that wants to contribute to the event.

""If we're going back to 1776, back to Benjamin Franklin having to be in Paris and getting help from the French, we're a country known to ask for help and give help, and this World Cup is a great opportunity for us as a country to be great hosts for these people,"" he said.

When the Trump administration announced the bans, it said nationals from the named countries ""have been involved with crimes that include murder, terrorism, embezzling public funds, human smuggling, human trafficking, and other criminal activity.""

""Widely unreliable foreign civil documents and lack of authoritative criminal information"" make it difficult for the U.S. to vet applicants, the administration said, adding that the government must ""exercise extreme vigilance"" in the visa-issuance process.

The policy has been attacked by Democrats and a number of civil and human rights organizations as being discriminatory, with Human Rights First describing the policy as ""racist"" and ""a sweeping act of collective punishment.""

Jonathan Grode, a prominent immigration lawyer in Philadelphia, said the inflexibility on immigration runs counter to the Trump Administration's own business instincts.

""You have (the Department of) Commerce, who understands the significance and importance of (sports diplomacy), and you have the immigration hawk faction, which, irrespective of the financial gain of the country, or what it means as a world leader, they are not interested in that if it goes against the overall objective of how they want to treat immigration,"" he said. ""And that is really what's coming to a head here.""

Asked whether FIFA might push for an exemption to the ban, a spokesman for the organization pointed out that FIFA has worked with the Trump administration to create an expedited visa interview process for anyone holding a World Cup ticket. Who ultimately receives a visa, however, is a different matter: ""The U.S. government... determines who gets a visa and who is admitted. FIFA is not involved in host country immigration processes.""

Critics said they think FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has grown close to Trump and awarded the American president the inaugural FIFA peace prize, should press his friend for an exemption.

""It's very difficult to process,"" said Lionel Lucien, a Haitian-American community leader in Boston, where Haiti will play its World Cup opener. ""There are people over there that would love to come and that qualify based on some of the requirements. The blank prohibition of Haiti to come for the World Cup is completely against the FIFA mission. It's hurtful and disrespectful.""

One retired veteran U.S. diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the U.S. has legitimate concerns about vetting people from poor or unstable countries seeking tourist visas. Haiti and Iran faced restrictions in previous administrations: ""Tourist visas for them are basically rare, if not impossible, to get, and some of it is just logistics,"" the former diplomat said. But, he said, a total ban is an extreme reaction.

""There's a way to handle it that's sane and measured and meant to solve the problem, and then another to use this completely for an ideological goal, and door 'B' is what they've chosen,"" the diplomat said.

Senegal may be ""a poor country, and there is significant fraud,"" the diplomat said, ""but to see upwardly-mobile citizens going to see their teams is not crazy to think about.""

Iran has been in its own category since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

""We've never had a functioning consular section there since the 'Argo' era,"" the diplomat said, referencing the film about the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. ""And the vetting is quite justified when an Iranian is not an ex-pat or a dissident, someone we already know.

""They're not just hostile (to the United States) but they're not sharing information that lets us trust in their identities and their passports. The difficulty in determining that a person holding an Iranian passport is actually that person-how can you trust that?""

Trump's announcement of the suspensions also stated that foreign nationals from the named countries have ""exploited the historic generosity of the United States"" by not adhering to the terms of their visas. According to Department of Homeland Security data, Haitians who have received visas over the past several years have overstayed the terms of their visas at a rate far beyond any other country in the World Cup. But that's an argument for vetting, the diplomat said, not for a blanket ban.

""For Haiti this is not just about soccer, it's about dignity and visibility,"" said James ""Reggie"" Colimon, a Haitian American who is director of global affairs and protocol for Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. ""Sport is supposed to unite the world, but Haiti can't participate? We are a country where all are welcome, supposedly, in theory, but what we're seeing is very different.

""When you single out one nation while welcoming others, it creates a credibility gap. No one will ever dispute security doesn't matter, but there's an inconsistency in the way we're doing things. The World Cup already operates under the highest security.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Prep

When four unassuming Argentines settled in for breakfast at the Hotel Kansas City on Dec. 10, no one — not even their hosts — knew that this, a low-key visit to America's 38th-largest city, would incite a heavyweight battle for World Cup base camps.

The Argentines — soccer administrators and fitness coaches — were there to tour hotels and facilities. They were searching for a temporary World Cup home, a place where Lionel Messi and the reigning champs could live and train this summer. But they'd just been to Texas; next, they'd go to Miami. Kansas City, a relatively humble town tucked away in Middle America, the smallest of the 2026 World Cup's metro areas, felt like an afterthought.

“The pervasive rumor for Argentina,” says Alan Dietrich, Kansas City's base camp lead, “was that they were going to be base-camping in Miami.”

Then, however, the four men squeezed into Dietrich's compact SUV. And as they hopped around Kansas and Missouri, from Sporting KC's training center to hotels, pleasantly surprised by the lack of traffic, charmed by Dietrich's affability, they felt … comfortable. By evening, they were chowing down on famous Kansas City barbecue at Jack Stack. “And they loved it,” Dietrich says.

As they devoured a spread of 10 meats, plus every side and dessert on the menu, they bonded with Dietrich and soccer-loving waiters. The following morning, they found an ideal World Cup hotel — with a coherent layout and space to roam, distant from downtown bustle. They eventually chose Kansas City for its location “and, more importantly, the amenities,” the Argentine soccer federation, AFA, said in a news release.

And, in doing so, they sent England scrambling.

England, throughout 2025, had fallen for Kansas City. Everyone, from executives to head coach Thomas Tuchel, had visited. They found a boutique hotel that felt, in some ways, like an elegant English estate. Over the summer, they negotiated directly with Sporting KC; both parties wanted to lock in a deal for the MLS club's training ground.

FIFA, however, intervened. It introduced rules that gave preference to highly-ranked teams and, crucially, to those with nearby group-stage games.

When December's World Cup draw gave Argentina and the Netherlands games in Kansas City, the Argentines, ranked No. 2, had first pick and chose Sporting's facilities. The Dutch, ranked No. 7, went next and chose the home of the NWSL's Kansas City Current. England, with matches in Texas, Massachusetts and New Jersey, “felt like they were on the outside looking in,” Sporting KC CEO Jake Reid tells The Athletic.

But they still felt attached to Kansas City. So they returned for another round of tours. And they found a solution.

They called Sporting KC and FIFA, who called Kansas City's host committee. Pam Kramer, the committee's CEO, remembers getting the call on Dec. 11 — as Argentina's visit was concluding. England, she was told, was now eyeing Swope Soccer Village, home of Sporting KC's reserve team and academy; could the region handle a fourth base camp — with Algeria reportedly set to camp in nearby Lawrence, Kan.? Could it accommodate three top-seven teams?

The answer was “yes.” It almost always has been “yes” in a city that, more so than others, sees the World Cup as a stage on which to perform for the world.

“There is a united, collective belief that this could be transformational for the way people think about Kansas City,” Kramer says, “and for the confidence we have in ourselves.”

That, above all, is why Kansas City will host three top seeds throughout the 2026 World Cup, while no other city will be home base for more than one.

In interviews with a variety of people close to the base camp process, several other reasons also emerged. Teams valued Kansas City's central location. They liked its modern facilities. They saw its summer heat as a tool to help them acclimatize. They loved the potential for privacy and the ease of moving around.

In the end, though, they were wooed by Midwestern hospitality, by proverbial “red carpets,” and by a proud region determined to shine in World Cup spotlights — to elevate itself onto a pedestal where other host cities already sit.

“This is the biggest thing we're ever going to host,” Jenny Wilson, the VP of tourism development for Visit KC and one of the many who welcomed Argentina's delegation, tells The Athletic. “L.A. has the Olympics, New York hosts massive things all the time, Miami, [etc.]. But for us, we'll never host anything this big again.”

This story, Kansas Citians say — the story of how their overlooked town became the base camp capital of the World Cup — begins with money. It begins with some $650 million invested in soccer infrastructure across the metro area since 2009, money that built the fields and facilities where Argentina, England and the Netherlands will soon train.

But the story accelerates in 2021, in crunch time for prospective World Cup cities, as FIFA officials toured 23 of them before picking 16. Of the 23, Kansas City was the third-smallest. It had to beat out Washington, D.C., the nation's capital; Nashville, the Music City; and Denver. It sold itself as the “soccer capital of America,” but it was, inherently, an underdog straddling two flyover states — one with a gloomy, rundown airport that it couldn't hide. (The new airport, which opened in 2023, was still under construction.)

So, on the evening of Oct. 20, 2021, Reid and the bid committee dispatched around 200 Sporting KC staffers and volunteers to roam the airport terminal as FIFA's delegation arrived, “just to make it look like it was energetic,” Reid says.

Drivers, with FIFA inspectors in tow, took a carefully scripted route through the city, past billboards and buildings that bellowed: “WE WANT THE WORLD CUP.”

The following morning, bid officials enlisted locals to play soccer on a grassy area near FIFA's hotel, along the path from meetings to a barbecue lunch.

“We went over the top,” Reid says. “I could probably guarantee you no other city was doing it to that degree.” That night, they reserved a suite at Sporting's stadium for a U.S. women's national team friendly. FIFA officials “ended up staying about 90 minutes after the match in our VIP suite,” Dietrich says, “just having a good time and partying.”

None of that, of course, directly explains why England and Argentina hand-picked Kansas City. But it speaks to the lengths that everyone, from politicians to random citizens, has gone to support or attract all aspects of the World Cup.

When administrators from touring teams would roll up to the Current's facility in Riverside, Mo., for example, the club's president, GM, head of facilities and a co-owner would be outside ready to greet them, Current owner Chris Long tells The Athletic. After handshakes and pleasantries, they'd head to a boardroom, then on a detailed tour of high-tech pitches, dining areas and other spaces.

“We wanted them to not only meet but hear from the top of the organization how we felt they would be treated,” Long says, and “how they would be able to have a secure, state-of-the-art stay in our area.”

Around a dozen teams, including France and Germany, ultimately visited Kansas City. Dietrich, a former Sporting KC exec, became something of a personal guide.

He took England's delegation, including Tuchel, to Top Golf and for a few games of padel. (“When he played padel,” Dietrich says of Tuchel, “man, he was intense.”)

He drove the Argentine delegation — fitness coaches Luis Martín and Juan Tamone, and administrators Daniel Cabrera and Alberto Pernas — all around the region, bonding with them as he went. Cabrera was fluent in English. Dietrich knew just enough Spanish. Whenever he'd hear a personal anecdote, or learn about Argentina's hotel needs, he'd grab his phone and tap out a text to managers at their next destination, priming them to make a strong impression. “I [was] driving with my knees,” Dietrich says with a laugh.

“It does sound obsessive, I know,” he adds. “But we are just that way.”

And he firmly believes that the obsessiveness, coupled with the warmth that he calls “KC kind,” is why international soccer's giants came to trust and covet Kansas City.

“Details don't just speak, they shout,” Dietrich says, reciting a quote. “People appreciate when the little things go right.”

England visited at least six times throughout 2025, and almost instantly, staffers loved the Sporting facility in Kansas City, Kan. At a cost of $75 million, it opened in 2018 and houses both the MLS club and various U.S. Soccer Federation activities. The English, and later Argentina, were impressed with everything from the multi-story gym to social spaces. What they couldn't initially find was a proper hotel.

So, ahead of their second visit, Dietrich and his team compiled options that aligned with England's needs. They eventually settled on a property south of Kansas City — reportedly the Inn at Meadowbrook — that England will rent out in its entirety for the duration of the World Cup. It's adjacent to a park and “tranquil lakes,” the perfect place for players to unwind. “We,” the hotel's website boasts, “have room to breathe.”

This, room to breathe, was part of Kansas City's broader appeal. The region — spread across 14 counties, countless suburbs and 8,472 square miles — is the antithesis of other World Cup markets, such as New York.

“This is also a very easy, secure place to have your existence during what is otherwise a very stressful time,” Long says. “It's not like there's super intense media here. You're not going to have an issue keeping players safe.”

Kansas City has developed a track record, too, for catering to superstars — such as Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, teammate Travis Kelce and Kelce's fiancée, Taylor Swift.

The final ingredient, for England, was an interpersonal touch. In June, when Tuchel, Football Association CEO Mark Bullingham and others visited Kansas City, Dietrich and Reid took them to Eddie V's, an upscale restaurant. In a private room, they feasted on steaks and swapped stories from their time in soccer. “We had a blast,” Dietrich recalls. And they solidified a relationship that underpins any base camp commitment.

“At the end of the day,” Reid says, “you have to feel good about the people.”

Dietrich frames it as four key questions: “Can we trust you? Will you be a partner with us? Will you help us when we need it? Do you care?”

By June, England knew that the resounding answers were yes, yes, yes and yes.

And in December, Kansas City proved it.

Months of diligence and meticulous prep gave way to a “frenzy” on Dec. 6. Hundreds of coaches and team administrators filed into a second-floor ballroom at D.C.'s Capital Hilton to learn their World Cup schedules, then fanned out across North America to scout base camps that jibed with their group fixtures. Many scheduled tours; others knocked on doors, unannounced. “Tunisia showed up at [Sporting KC's] stadium,” Reid recalls. “Our security guy called me, he's like, ‘Hey, Tunisia's here.' We were like, ‘What?'”

“It was like the Wild West,” Reid says.

Argentina, though, held the keys. When it chose Sporting KC, dominoes started falling. The Netherlands, sitting second in the Kansas City pecking order, had visited in early 2025 and again soon after the draw. On follow-up calls over Zoom, the Dutch talked through logistics with the Current. They leant into the idea of using a world-class training facility purpose-built for women's professional soccer, the first of its kind. They committed. And with that, everyone else was effectively shut out.

“Austria was interested in the Current facility,” Reid says. “They probably would've picked that if not for Argentina.” Instead, the Austrians were forced to head west.

But England — which also held extensive conversations with the Current — forced its way back into the conversation. After touring multiple other U.S. cities, it arranged yet another Kansas City visit and inquired about Swope. Kramer's first thought was about budget — could the host committee afford to secure a third site? After discussions with local government officials and police departments, all involved decided they'd find a way.

Reid's first thought, meanwhile, was: Uh, where will we train?

For years, he'd planned to send Sporting's first team to Swope while a World Cup team took over the club's main facility. If England were to take over Swope as well, he'd have to search for a Plan C.

So, he began searching. Two months later, he still is. Nonetheless, after discussing the dilemma with Sporting KC's owners and GM, the thought of turning England away was never seriously considered.

When asked why — why would you give up two facilities at the expense of your own team? — Reid gets philosophical. Positioning Kansas City as the “base camp capital of the world,” he explains, will lift the city and his club. It will be a marketing tool and a recruiting tool. English and Argentine stars will go back to their clubs (and their agents) and glow about the K.C. experience. Perhaps, someday, one of them (or a friend) will return as a Sporting player.

And for the region, benefits are already evident. Kansas City is on the map. At this World Cup, it will be more visible than Boston, than Seattle, perhaps even Philadelphia and Atlanta.

“Perhaps, at one point, we were happy to be nominated, we were happy to have a seat at the table,” Kramer says. “Now, we want to be the best host city in the tournament.”

Mexico has announced it will debut three commemorative coins leading up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including the country's first-ever 25-peso coin, which will be made out of pure gold.

The new coins celebrate Mexico's third time hosting the World Cup, which it previously hosted in 1970 and 1986. This time around, however, it will host alongside the United States and Canada in an unprecedented tournament across three countries.

“Mexico will be the first country to host the FIFA World Cup for the third time,” the Senate said in its official X account.“In commemoration of this important event, the Senate approved the creation of three commemorative coins as a memento of the sporting competition.”

With 94 votes in favor, the Senate approved three new commemorative coins with different materials, values ​​and characteristics: a pure gold coin with a face value of 25 pesos, a pure silver coin with a face value of 10 pesos, and a bimetallic coin with a face value of 20 pesos.

The coins' design will share key elements. The obverse will boast the National Coat of Arms in sculptural relief, with the legend “Estados Unidos Mexicanos” forming a semicircle above. Meanwhile, the reverse will feature a design with motifs alluding to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Once the decree is officially issued and published in the Official Gazette of the Federation (DOF), the coins will be available for purchase at authorized banking institutions, the Casa de Moneda de México (Mexican Mint) and specialized official shops.

Senators from various political parties said the commemorative coins highlight the cultural, social and economic importance of football in Mexico, which will host 13 matches across Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. The inaugural game will take place at the Banorte Stadium, formerly known as Azteca Stadium, on June 11.

The World Cup coins are not to be confused with the new 10 and 20-peso coins that the Mexican Mint will gradually introduce starting this year. These ones are expected to reduce minting costs and strengthen anti-counterfeiting security.

Mikel Arteta has transformed Arsenal into a juggernaut, but the shadow of an impending exit is already looming over the Emirates Stadium. Despite the Gunners' current dominance, former midfield general Emmanuel Petit believes that a return to Spain is inevitable for the current boss, with a specific destination already carved out in the stars. Arteta, who has guided Arsenal to the top of the Premier League and into the latter stages of the Champions League, is increasingly seen as the natural heir to the throne at one of European football's most prestigious institutions.

Petit, a man who knows exactly what it takes to succeed in north London, is adamant that Arteta's journey will eventually lead him back to his roots. The Frenchman suggests that regardless of whether the current project ends in major silverware or heartbreak, the pull of a return to the club that helped shape his footballing philosophy will prove too strong to resist. The narrative around Arteta's long-term future is shifting, with Petit suggesting that the Spaniard's managerial ceiling extends far beyond the confines of the Premier League.

The connection between Arteta and Barcelona is deep. Having come through the famed La Masia academy, the Arsenal boss is a student of the Blaugrana way, and Petit believes it is only a matter of time before he returns. ""Mikel Arteta will one day manage Barcelona, I think eventually we'll see that,"" Petit told BetBrothers. ""The connections are strong. But I think it depends on how he wants to deal with his managerial career, in terms of having his mind set to be there forever, like a one-club man sort of thing.""

While Arsenal fans may be desperate to keep their tactical mastermind for the long haul, Petit feels that the allure of Camp Nou will eventually outweigh any loyalty to the London project. He continued: ""Does he really want to experience football in different countries? To be honest, if he is to leave Arsenal, I see him more likely to go abroad than to another Premier League club. So, obviously, I'd say Barca would be his favourite next move if he were to leave Arsenal.""

Arsenal suffered another setback after being held to a 2-2 draw by Wolves on Wednesday. The result opened the door for Manchester City to close the gap to just two points in the title race, intensifying the battle at the top of the standings as the season enters a decisive stretch. After guiding Arsenal two second-place finishes three years in a row, the possibility of another failure is looming, placing more pressure on the coach's shoulders.

However, Petit suggests that Arteta's departure might not depend on the results of the current quadruple chase. Whether the Gunners lift every trophy in sight or fall short at the final hurdle, the outcome remains the same in his eyes. ""To be honest, I don't know what's best. If he wins, he will leave. If he doesn't win, he will leave. I don't know. If he wins, he might continue to increase the number of trophies,"" Petit added.

""We would have to be in Arteta's head to think what he wants to do in the future. But for me, I see him more on the long term, as long as possible to stay at Arsenal, rather than moving somewhere else, than leaving any time soon.""

If Arteta does depart for Catalonia, the question of who fills the void becomes paramount. For Petit, the answer is another former Arsenal captain who has been making waves in the dugout: Cesc Fabregas. Currently impressing as the head coach of Serie A side Como, Fabregas is quickly building a reputation as one of the brightest young minds in the game. Petit believes that the Spaniard's growth as a leader makes him a prime candidate for the Arsenal hot seat when the time eventually comes.

Petit has been particularly impressed by the way Fabregas has handled high-profile players and dressing room discipline. ""I think Cesc Fabregas will take his time because he has everything he needs at Como,"" Petit continued. ""He wants players, they bring him players. Whatever he wants, they bring it to him. And that's allowing him to have that kind of power in the decision-making.""

Petit pointed to a recent incident involving Alvaro Morata as evidence of Fabregas's maturing authority. ""I think I saw something this weekend which I haven't seen throughout the season with Alvaro Morata. Morata got sent off because he reacted to a provocation and Fabregas came out publicly to say, you know, he should know better. I think it's the first time he goes public about a player instead of, you know, going public as he probably did in the past. So for me, that's showing personality, showing, 'I'm the boss,' and that obviously is a sign of 'I'm going to be here for a while.""

Ultimately, Petit expects the biggest clubs in world football to come calling for Fabregas, with Arsenal and Chelsea likely to be at the front of the queue given his history with both clubs. ""His former clubs will let managers go and obviously Chelsea, Arsenal, I mean really any club at the top, will be looking at him as an option because he's doing an incredible job at Como,"" Petit concluded. While Arteta remains the man for the present, the blueprint for Arsenal's future is already being drafted by those who know the club best.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Dusan Vlahovic has reportedly instructed his representatives to prioritise a move to Barcelona as he nears the end of his contract with Juventus. The Serbian striker is eager to succeed Robert Lewandowski at Camp Nou, viewing the Blaugrana as his preferred destination despite interest from the Premier League and Serie A rivals AC Milan.

The dawn of a new era at Camp Nou could be spearheaded by one of Serie A's most clinical marksmen. Juventus forward Vlahovic has, Tuttosportreports, made his intentions clear, setting his sights on a high-profile move to Barcelona this summer. The Serbian international, whose future in Turin has been a subject of intense speculation, has emerged as a primary candidate to fill the void that will eventually be left by Lewandowski.

Reporting in Italy continues to claim that the Serbian striker is keen to move to Barcelona above all destinations available to him, signalling a clear desire to test himself in the ranks of the Blaugrana as they navigate a transitional period for their frontline. Vlahovic finds himself in a position of significant leverage as his current contract with Juventus nears its end, making him one of the market's most attractive assets.

With no progress made in negotiations over an extension in Turin, the 26-year-old is poised to become one of the most sought-after free agents in European football. This availability aligns perfectly with Barcelona's strategic planning, as the club faces the pressing need to replace their legendary Polish number nine.

Barca sporting director Deco is tasked with finding a successor who can maintain the scoring pedigree required at such a prestigious club. However, the financial landscape remains a hurdle, as it is not yet clear what space in their salary budget the Catalans will have to facilitate such a high-profile arrival. While Vlahovic has made his preference known, he is not the only name on the shortlist.

Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez remains a preferred option for the board, but putting together a deal for the Argentine looks difficult given the likely transfer fee involved. This makes Vlahovic an increasingly attractive prospect, particularly due to his potential status as a free agent. The reports coming from Italysuggest that Vlahovic will prioritise a move to Barcelona first and foremost, believing his physical presence could provide a seamless transition from the Lewandowski era.

Vlahovic offers the profile of a traditional number nine, whereas other targets might offer more versatility. Earlier this month, Serbia fitness coach Dusan Ilic tipped the striker to end up in Spain, stating: ""Vlahovic has the mentality and the physical tools to lead a line like Barcelona's; it feels like the natural next step for his career.""

According to the same report, Vlahovic's future will begin to take shape in March, but he is clear on what he wants and has instructed his agents to put talks with Barcelona before any other interested parties. This proactive stance highlights the player's commitment to securing a move to La Liga over staying in Italy, with Milan said to be trying to lure him, or moving to England.

The Serbian is not ruling out other options entirely, but the message to his representatives is unambiguous. If Barcelona do not make an offer, then he is open to talks with Juventus regarding a renewal or entertaining offers from Premier League sides who have long tracked his progress in Serie A.

This ""Barca-first"" policy suggests that the allure of playing at the regenerated Camp Nou outweighs the financial packages that might be offered by English clubs. His agents have reportedly been given strict instructions regarding the hierarchy of his potential next clubs, with the Catalan giants sitting firmly at the top of that list.

The coming weeks will be crucial for both the player and the club. As March approaches, the situation with his contract at Juventus will either reach a resolution or, more likely, confirm his departure as a free agent. The likelihood is that Barcelona will bide their time until the summer to make a final call on their primary target, creating a high-stakes waiting game.

This strategy carries risks for the Blaugrana; if they wait too long to commit to Vlahovic, they risk losing him to rival suitors who are prepared to move faster with concrete contract offers. Conversely, moving too early could limit their financial flexibility to chase other high-priority targets like Alvarez should the market shift in their favour.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Crazy' Tottenham star is singled out as an 'easy target' for opponents as ex-Spurs striker explains major reason for his old side's struggles","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/crazy-tottenham-star-singled-out-easy-target-ex-spurs-striker-explains-reason-struggles/blt9e8cf2d8cf9acd01","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:24:59 GMT","

Tottenham have been warned that “crazy” club captain Cristian Romero is threatening to undermine collective efforts, with Bobby Zamora telling GOAL why the enigmatic Argentine defender has become an “easy target” for opponents. The South American centre-half can be wound up to the point that he does something reckless, with rivals able to get under his skin.

Romero, who fills the armband for Spurs, has made more unfortunate headlines this season. He openly criticised the team's recruitment policy following a 2-2 draw with Manchester City that saw him take to the field despite feeling unwell. He posted on social media after that contest: “I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn't feeling well, especially as we had only 11 players available – unbelievable but true and disgraceful.”

In Tottenham's following fixture, Romero picked up a red card during a clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford. That dismissal proved costly as Spurs slipped to a 2-0 defeat. Danish coach Thomas Frank lasted just one more game - a loss to Newcastle - before being relieved of his managerial duties.

Spurs, who are now working under interim boss Igor Tudor, have slumped to 16th in the Premier League table - just five points clear of the relegation zone. Questions are being asked of whether they will be dragged into a battle for survival.

Ex-Tottenham striker Zamora - speaking via Northerner - told GOAL when asked why Spurs are finding the going so tough: “For me, I still look at their defence, and that's probably how I have looked at them for maybe four or five years. I don't ever look at the centre-halves, or the back four, and go ‘you are an organised unit'.

“Romero is crazy. Every single week I think you can get a penalty out of him, or you have always got a chance of winding him up and getting him sent off. For me as a striker, that would be an easy target every single week - stick one on him, he's going to retaliate and off he goes, down to 10 men. 

“They just don't seem solid enough and you need to build your foundations from that. There has been a lot about that Arsenal team conceding goals, and that Chelsea team - [John] Terry, [Ricardo] Carvalho, [William] Gallas, that was a good back four and you need to build from a defensive aspect and then go forward and have a couple of boys that can create chances and score goals.”

Zamora is not the only onlooker to have spotted serious faults in Romero's game, with ex-Premier League manager Sam Allardyce of the opinion that the World Cup winner should have leadership duties taken off him.

Former England boss Allardyce has said: “Cristian Romero is one of those typical players who just does not learn. He has got so much talent, but so many flaws which he has not eradicated. He is still making the same mistakes as when he first signed for Tottenham

“Either he gets stripped of the captaincy, or someone says to him, ‘stay on your feet, I do not want you to go to ground when you tackle anymore', and if he continues to do it, then take him out of the side. 

“He is giving his managers a bad reputation for not being able to control him. If you are a centre-half, your first priority is being a defender, not how good you are with the ball – that is only an added bonus.”

Zamora has warned Spurs that they can “probably only go under the radar for two years” before they are no longer considered part of the Premier League's fabled ‘Big Six'. They finished 17th last season, despite winning the Europa League under Ange Postecoglou.

The current campaign has been a struggle again and things are not about to get any easier as Tudor's first game at the helm will be a north London derby date with arch-rivals Arsenal on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A tactical battle turned toxic at San Siro as Massimiliano Allegri and Cesc Fabregas were involved in a heated touchline confrontation. Physical obstructions, red cards, and a tunnel spat overshadowed the goalless draw between AC Milan and Como, leaving the veteran and the newcomer at war.

The technical area at San Siro transformed into a theatre of intense drama on Wednesday evening as AC Milan and Como played out a fractious 1-1 draw. Tensions between the two dugouts reached a breaking point during a match defined by tactical friction and personal clashes, with Milan boss Allegri and Como head coach Fabregas at the centre of a heated storm.

The primary flashpoint occurred when Fabregas, incensed that Alexis Saelemaekers had escaped a second yellow card, appeared to take matters into his own hands. As the Belgian winger attempted to launch a transition, the Spanish coach physically obstructed him, reportedly grabbing the player's shirt to impede his progress. This breach of protocol triggered a furious reaction from the Milan bench, leading to a massive melee and a red card for Allegri.

Despite the post-match apology, the atmosphere remained palpable with a sense of lingering animosity. The seeds of this conflict were sown during the first meeting between the clubs at the Stadio Sinigaglia earlier this season, but those frustrations exploded into public view during the return fixture in Milan. The result sees Milan lose further ground in the title race, a fact Allegri tried to downplay despite the visible frustration.

The two managers reportedly crossed paths in the narrow corridors leading to the press conference room, where another verbal exchange took place. Allegri reportedly told his Como counterpart in the tunnel: ""You're a child who started out as a coach."" Allegri, ever the veteran, framed the incident as a disciplinary failure rather than a mere emotional outburst.

Addressing the media with a repentant tone, Fabregas explained that his intervention was born out of the heat of the moment rather than malice. ""I ask for forgiveness because I did something I'm not proud of, I did something unsporting. We stole the ball, but I touched [Saelemaekers] a little out of emotion. Like [Inter boss Christian] Chivu said the other day: hands off, especially the coach. We can't do this. One thing I hope I never do again.""

Allegri was far less inclined to let the matter rest, offering a biting critique of the young Spaniard's conduct. ""Did he apologise? I see, so if someone runs along the line next time, I'll do a slide and I'll go in too. I went there to defend Saelemaekers, the player had a reaction and in that moment one of Como's men came towards me, I don't know who it is, but nothing happened.""

The Milan manager continued by suggesting that Fabregas still has much to learn about the discipline required in the managerial hot seat. ""When you are on the pitch you have to be respectful towards the referee and towards the teams. There was an exchange between coaches. He is a very young coach. I wish him to win a lot in his career because he has all the qualities to do so.""

Despite the friction, Fabregas found a moment of grace to praise Milan's 41-year-old maestro, Luka Modric. ""It is a true pleasure to see him play. I have congratulated him... what could I do. He is a phenomenon, a privilege to have him in Serie A. We tried to press him hard, with physical contact, and he doesn't care. Against two, against four, he always finds the solution.""

AC Milan must now turn their attention away from the touchline antics and back to the Serie A standings, where they are desperately clinging to the trailing pack of the title race. The loss of two points at home is a significant blow to Allegri's ambitions, and the manager will likely face a touchline ban following his dismissal during the scuffle.

For Fabregas and Como, the point at San Siro is a massive statement of intent, proving they can compete with Italy's giants even if their methods occasionally cross the line. The Spanish coach will be eager to move past the controversy and focus on the tactical growth of his squad, which showed flashes of brilliance through Paz before the chaos took over.

Milan's resilience will be tested in their next match when they take on Parma on Sunday, while Como will look to build momentum against Juventus on Saturday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Three Chelsea vs Burnley predictions for their Premier League clash on 21 February 2026 at 8:30 pm, including value on a goalscorer pick.

Our betting expert expects Chelsea to dominate the game and secure a convincing victory at home.

Chelsea quickly got over the disappointment of their 2-2 Premier League draw with Leeds last weekend. The Blues faced their manager's former side, Hull, in the fourth round of the FA Cup, and they came out on top. Their 4-0 triumph was a reminder to the rest of the participants in the cup that they're serious contenders for the trophy. This performance has significantly boosted their odds, and players can take advantage of the momentum by using a Stake.com Promo Code for the upcoming fixtures.

However, Liam Rosenior's charges are still under pressure in the league, as Liverpool are only two points behind. As things stand, Chelsea occupy the final Champions League position. Yet, with 12 games remaining, the margin for error is shrinking.

Fortunately, the West Londoners face what appears to be a straightforward fixture next. They're entertaining a Burnley team that are fighting for their Premier League status. The Clarets secured an away victory at Crystal Palace last weekend, which kept them in touch with West Ham.

Scott Parker's men will take confidence from defeating a London club, as they visit the team he once played for this weekend. Burnley are six points behind West Ham and are not completely out of the fight for safety yet. A win at Stamford Bridge would allow them to put pressure on West Ham, who host Bournemouth next.

Chelsea expected lineup: Sanchez, James, Acheampong, Chalobah, Cucurella, Caicedo, Santos, Palmer, Fernandez, Neto, Pedro

Burnley expected lineup: Dubravka, Laurent, Esteve, Worrall, Walker, Ugochukwu, Ward-Prowse, Humphreys, Edwards, Anthony, Fleming

Chelsea have put together a neat run under their new boss. The Blues are now unbeaten in their last five Premier League outings. Rosenior's only defeats since taking over in January came against Arsenal in the League Cup semi-final.

The hosts have won seven of their last nine matches in all competitions. This suggests they're entering this game with a heap of confidence. Thankfully for Burnley, last week's win snapped a 16-game winless streak in the league.

However, the visitors endured a horrible weekend. They were dumped out of the FA Cup at home by League One outfit, Mansfield Town. That's three defeats in their most recent four matches, which isn't good news for the travelling fans.

The West London club enjoy a record of losing just once across the last 15 head-to-heads. The Blues have won three of the last four meetings, including the reverse fixture at Turf Moor in November last year. Additionally, two of those wins saw Chelsea score exactly four goals.

With the riches that Chelsea have in their squad, it's no surprise that they're prolific up front. The Blues have scored in 24 of their 26 league matches this term. At home, they average 1.69 goals per game and tend to concede 1.15 goals per game.

Burnley's front line haven't been bad at all, as they've scored 28 goals in 26 games. Yet, they've been far better away from home, delivering 16 goals in 13 outings. The Clarets average 1.23 goals per away game in the league.

The main issue for Parker's men is their leaky defence on the road, with 32 goals in 13 matches. The hosts will be eager to capitalise on this. However, they should be wary since 62% of their league matches at home saw both teams score. For those wagering on the move, exploring the Best Betting Apps is key to finding the fastest odds and the smoothest mobile experience for this clash.

Meanwhile, 77% of Burnley's away Premier League matches produced goals at both ends, which is a likely scenario this weekend.

Chelsea's leading Premier League goalscorer this season is their summer signing Joao Pedro. The Brazilian registered 10 goals in total, six of which arrived at Stamford Bridge. Rosenior favours Pedro to lead the line, but he was rested in their FA Cup fixture last weekend.

He will no doubt feature in the starting lineup against Burnley and pose a constant threat. Pedro has scored five goals in his last six appearances for the club in all competitions. He's in form at the moment, which makes him a major threat to the visiting side.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Anti-racism charity Kick It Out has accused Benfica manager Jose Mourinho of 'gaslighting' Vinicius Junior following a controversial Champions League encounter. The fallout stems from Real Madrid's 1-0 victory in Lisbon, where the Brazilian superstar reported being racially abused by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni. Amidst the tension, Mourinho suggested that the forward's own behaviour and exuberant goal celebration had ""incited"" the hostile atmosphere and provoked the opposition players.

The match was paused for nearly 10 minutes after Benfica fans threw objects at the Madrid star as he celebrated at the corner flag following his stunning and decisive goal in the 1-0 win in Lisbon. As play was about to restart, the Brazilian rushed toward the referee, alleging that Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni had directed a racist remark at him. The incident sparked outrage on the field and on the stands, as players and coaches of both sides reacted while the crowd jeered.

After the game, Benfica boss Mourinho stepped into the spotlight with comments that have only intensified the debate, backing his club's position while also casting doubt on the appropriateness of the Madrid forward's behaviour during the match.

""It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal in a good game... these talents are able to do these beautiful things but unfortunately [Vinicius] was not just happy to score that astonishing goal and then the game was over. When you score a goal like that you celebrate in a respectful way,"" he told Amazon.

When pressed on whether Vinicius had actively provoked the home support and the Benfica squad, the former Chelsea and Madrid boss was firm in his belief. Mourinho added: ""Yeah, I believe so. The words they exchange, Prestianni with Vinicius, I want to be independent. I don't comment about it.""

Mourinho also revealed the nature of his touchline conversation with the player during a break in play. He recounted: ""I told him that when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. And then, when he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing it is is racist, so if in his mind it was something in relation to that, this is Benfica. There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium. Every stadium that Vinicius plays [in] something happens. Always. I'm saying that it was a good 50 minutes of football, millions of people watching around the world, a crazy goal absolutely crazy goal and then game over.""

Mourinho's comments have already drawn criticism, as have Benfica's public support of the Argentine in the wake of the furore. Kick It Out took aim at the ex-Chelsea and Manchester United boss with a series of powerful statements on social media, condemning the manager's rhetoric as harmful and deflective. The charity said on X: ""When anyone reports discrimination in football, or anywhere, the first priority is that they are listened to and feel supported. Focusing on Vinicius Jr's goal celebration or the history of the club, instead of acknowledging the report, is a form of gaslighting. This approach not only harms the individual affected but also sends the wrong message to others around the world who may have experienced similar situations. Leaders in football have a crucial role in setting standards, and moments like these call for responsible leadership that reinforces respect, inclusion, and accountability. We look forward to a thorough investigation into this incident, with appropriate accountability linked to the outcome.""

Despite the global outcry, Benfica have moved to support Prestianni, who faces allegations of calling Vinicius a 'monkey'. The club released an official statement saying: ""The Club reaffirms, clearly and unequivocally, its historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality, respect, and inclusion, which align with the core values of its foundation and which have Eusébio as their greatest symbol. Sport Lisboa e Benfica reiterates that it fully supports and believes in the version presented by the player Gianluca Prestianni, whose conduct while serving the Club has always been guided by respect for opponents, institutions, and the principles that define Benfica's identity. The Club regrets the defamation campaign to which the player has been subjected.""

Prestianni has also broken his silence, taking to social media to deny the accusations and question why his opponents did not react more aggressively if such a comment had been made. He posted on Instagram: ""I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to player Vinicius Junior, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.""

The situation remains incredibly volatile as the footballing community awaits intervention from the governing bodies to determine the facts of the night. With UEFA already opening a full investigation into the incident, the evidence ranging from broadcast footage to witness testimonies will be under intense scrutiny.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg issues apology after backlash to Vinicius Junior comments","https://www.goal.com/en-ug/lists/former-premier-league-referee-mark-clattenburg-apology-backlash-vinicius-junior-comments/blt6c90390540403dbb","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 12:23:04 GMT","

Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg has apologised for his “clumsy” analysis of the incident involving Real Madrid forward Vinicius and Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni that has seen allegations of racism surface. Clattenburg formed part of Amazon Prime Video's coverage of a Champions League fixture that took place at Estadio da Luz.

An eventful contest in Lisbon saw Brazil international Vinicius open the scoring in spectacular fashion early in the second half. After firing the ball into the top corner, the South American took to celebrating by the corner flag in front of agitated home supporters.

He eventually made his way back towards the halfway line and lined up opposite Prestianni ready for the restart. The 20-year-old Argentine muttered something, while hiding his mouth with his shirt, and Vinicius raced off towards match referee Francois Letexier.

The game was subsequently brought to a halt, as UEFA guidelines were followed on the back of alleged racist comments being made, and did not restart for 10 minutes. It was during that break that Clattenburg delivered his controversial analysis.

He said of Vinicius: “Yes, he scored a wonderful goal but he should have just returned over to the other side of the pitch and he could have got on with the game. Vinicius Jr has not helped himself. He's made this difficult for the referee. He's scored a wonderful goal and all he has to do - yes, celebrate - is return back. But he has made this situation very, very difficult.”

Clattenburg's comments attracted plenty of criticism on social media. Troy Townsend, who has worked for anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out for more than a decade, was among those to speak up as he posted on X: “He should never be involved in commentary again.”

Townsend has since told Telegraph Sport: “Clattenburg would have influenced so many people with his words on commentary about the incident. His insinuation that Vini Jr has given the referee a problem is nothing short of outlandish and part of the victim-blaming culture that always exists at this time, particularly with Vini Jnr. 

“His employers may need to make him aware of how dangerous his comments were and how they could be perceived but I'm sure he would be aware of that.”

Clattenburg is aware that he spoke out of line and has offered an apology in his own social media post, which reads: “Nothing justifies racism in sport or in life. I got it wrong, I'm sorry.

“It was live TV, my job is to respond in the moment and the words I used were clumsy and not right. I'm already learning from this and appreciate my colleagues who covered the situation with class throughout.”

Vinicius said in a post-match statement, having been subjected to several racist taunts down the years: “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them. 

“Nothing that happened today is new in my life or in my team's life. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like to appear in situations like this, especially after a big win and when the headlines should be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.”

Prestianni has denied accusations of racially abusing Vinicius, claiming that the Brazilian winger “misunderstood what he thought he heard”. His manager at Benfica, former Real boss Jose Mourinho, has also attracted criticism for trying to defend the actions of his player.

UEFA, European football's governing body, has opened an investigation into what occurred in Lisbon. The Portuguese government, through the Authority for the Prevention and Fight against Violence in Sport (APCVD), are also looking into the incident. Any sanctions will be announced once those processes have been completed.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid have confirmed that they “actively collaborated with the investigation opened by UEFA” following accusations of racist abuse being aimed at Vinicius Junior during the Blancos' Champions League clash with Benfica. Gianluca Prestianni stands accused of making the comments in question, with ugly scenes playing out at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.

A knockout phase play-off clash between Spanish and Portuguese giants was halted for 10 minutes early in the second half. Vinicius had registered the only goal of the game in the 50th minute, as he crashed a shot from just inside the penalty area into the top corner.

Celebrations carried out in front of angry home supporters led to initial clashes between Benfica and Real Madrid players, with Vinicius being left stunned when he was shown a yellow card.

He eventually returned to the halfway line, as he lined up with Prestianni in close proximity, but rushed towards match referee Francois Letexier before play could get back underway and alleged that he had been subjected to racist abuse.

The match officials followed UEFA protocols, as proceedings were put on hold, with plenty of heated debates and finger pointing taking place. European football's governing body announced after the final whistle had sounded that an investigation into what went on would be opened.

An official statement read: “A UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector has been appointed to investigate allegations of discriminatory behaviour during the UEFA Champions League 2025/2026 Knock-out Play-off between Club Benfica and Real Madrid CF on 17 February 2026. Further information regarding this matter will be made available in due course.”

Real have played a prominent role in those proceedings, with every effort being made to assist UEFA. A statement from the Liga giants on their official website reads: “Real Madrid C. F. announces that today it has submitted all available evidence to UEFA regarding the incidents that occurred last Tuesday, February 17, during the Champions League match our team played in Lisbon against SL Benfica.

“Our club has actively collaborated with the investigation opened by UEFA following the unacceptable episodes of racism experienced during that match.

“Real Madrid appreciates the unanimous support, backing, and affection that our player Vinicius Jr. has received from all areas of the global football community. Real Madrid will continue working, in collaboration with all institutions, to eradicate racism, violence, and hate in sports and society.”

Vinicius, who has been targeted by bigots on a regular basis throughout his time at Santiago Bernabeu, said in an emotional statement that was made on the back of generating more unfortunate headlines: “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them. 

“Nothing that happened today is new in my life or in my team's life. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like to appear in situations like this, especially after a big win and when the headlines should be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.”

Prestianni denied Vinicius's allegations in a social media statement of his own, which read: “I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.”

 Flavio Cobolli, feeling like a superhero at the Delray Beach Open. 

 The third-seeded Italian celebrated his first ATP Tour win since 4 January on Wednesday by showing off his new tattoo to the crowd at the hard-court ATP 250 in Florida. Cobolli, who overcame Terence Atmane 7-5, 6-4, was quick to attribute his victory to the distinctive green character now inked into his right leg: The Hulk. 

 ""In Davis Cup [last year], you remember I [ripped] my t-shirt, so now I have Hulk,” said the No. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings Cobolli in his on-court interview. “It's fresh, like two weeks old. I felt like Hulk on the court [then], so now I have to be like him!” 

""I feel like Hulk on the court now"" 🤣💪🦸‍♂️

Italian superhero @cobollifla has a new tattoo to share...#DBOpen | 📍Delray Beach pic.twitter.com/mCCda4gmim

 Cobolli's shirt-shredding celebration that inspired the tattoo came after he saved seven match points and won a 32-point deciding-set tie-break to overcome Zizou Bergs and seal Italy a spot in November's Davis Cup Final, which the European country subsequently won. He showcased that sort of on-court grit again against Atmane on Wednesday by bouncing back from four consecutive defeats to set a quarter-final meeting with Coleman Wong, who defeated Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-6(4). 

 “It's my first win [for a while], so I'm really happy to be in the middle of the court,” said Cobolli after levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Atmane at 1-1. “It was tough, the beginning of the year, but now I'm really happy to be here at this fantastic tournament. 

 “It was a different result [to last time]. I lost to him last time with a great battle in Cincinnati. I practised well this week and felt comfortable staying on the court for a long time. I'm really happy how I managed this first round against a tough opponent like Terence.” 

In other action, second seed Casper Ruud fought off a stern test from Marcos Giron, defeating the American 4-6, 7-6(6), 6-4. Giron will rue being two points from victory at 6/6 in the second-set tie-break.







Ruud then built upon his momentum by breaking the American's serve in the opening game of the decider before sailing across the finish line. Playing in his first tournament since the Australian Open, the 27-year-old improved to 3-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Giron and will now look to extend his perfect 2-0 record against Sebastian Korda.

Ruud is making his first appearance at the ATP 250 in Delray Beach, where the Norwegian arrived just weeks after he and his fiancée Maria welcomed the birth of their first child, a daughter.You May Also Like: Ruud, new father, returns ‘to win matches and see if I can play for more than myself' 
Korda defeated countryman Alex Michelsen 6-3, 7-6(6), saving four set points in the second set to avoid a decider and reach the last eight. The 25-year-old broke Michelsen at 4-5 in the second set, crucially getting back on serve after facing three set points in that game. Korda fended off another set point on return at 5/6 in the tie-break.

Korda, the No. 50 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, is the second man to reach three tour-level quarter-finals this season, alongside Ben Shelton. Korda reached the Delray Beach final in 2021.

Argentine Thiago Agustin Tirante led countryman and top seed Francisco Cerundolo 6-2, 3-1 in the second round of the Rio Open presented by Claro on Wednesday evening when Cerundolo retired due to a back injury.

Fresh off a run to his hometown title at the Argentina Open in Buenos Aires, Cerundolo made a good start at the Rio de Janeiro ATP 500 event with a straight-sets win against Mariano Navone. But he was unable to make it through his match with Tirante.

“It's not good to win like this, especially with Fran, one of my friends. Any moment, I didn't see anything,” Tirante said. “I knew that he was very tired from last week, so I had to improve myself on the court and focus on me.”

After one game in the second set, Cerundolo requested a visit from the physio and received treatment on his back. That did not allow him to push on much longer, though.

Tirante hit an ace to take a 3-1 lead — his seventh ace of the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats — and Cerundolo barely moved for the ball. The top seed then approached the net to shake hands with his friend and retire.

Tirante will next take on Francesco Passaro or Alejandro Tabilo.

Alexander Zverev and Alex de Minaur have confirmed they will represent Team Europe and Team World, respectively, at the ninth edition of the Laver Cup, to be held at The O2 in London from 25-27 September 2026.

Zverev and De Minaur join the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Carlos Alcaraz (Team Europe), and Taylor Fritz (Team World) in the competition.





A six-time Laver Cup competitor and the event's all-time leading points scorer, Zverev returns to London with unfinished business after last year's defeat in San Francisco – the first Laver Cup loss of his career. The German had previously been part of Team Europe's title-winning teams in Prague (2017), Chicago (2018), Geneva (2019), Boston (2021) and Berlin (2024). 

Zverev also returns to London, a city where he has enjoyed significant success, including winning the Nitto ATP Finals at The O2 in 2018. He made a good start to his 2026 season, reaching the Australian Open semi-finals (l. to Alcaraz).

“I always love being part of the Laver Cup,” said Zverev. “The team atmosphere is incredible, and the intensity is unlike anything else we play all year. London is a great tennis city and The O2 is one of the most special stadiums in the world for me and has already delivered some unforgettable moments for this event. I'm excited to return and hopefully we can win the title back for Team Europe.”

Team World's top-ranked player and winner of last week's ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, De Minaur will compete in his third Laver Cup. Having been part of Team World's first title victory in London in 2022, he was pivotal again last year in San Francisco, where he won all three of his matches to help secure another victory for Team World.

“Laver Cup is one of the most intense and exciting weeks on the calendar,” said de Minaur. “Playing in London in 2022 was a special moment for our team and San Francisco showed what this group is capable of. I loved playing under Andre Agassi last year and I'm really looking forward to getting back out there in London with him and the team.""

Amanda Anisimova ended Mirra Andreeva's title defense at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships in the quarterfinals, coming through a nailbiter in a third-set tiebreak. She will face Jessica Pegula, who defeated last year's finalist Clara Tauson in three sets, in an all-American semifinal.

No. 2 seed Amanda Anisimova ended No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva's Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships title defense 2-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) in a quarterfinal thriller, holding off a late charge from 5-3 down in the third set by the 18-year-old to convert her fourth match point after 2 hours and 38 minutes. Anisimova had trailed by a set and 2-0 before mounting a comeback of her own.

Anisimova will face No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula in an all-American semifinal, a reprise of last month's Australian Open quarterfinal tilt. Pegula edged No. 12 seed and last year's runner-up Clara Tauson 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 to reach her seventh consecutive semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, a streak that stretches back to last year's US Open.

Dubai: Scores |  Draws | Order of play 

""I was almost in tears there at the end,"" Anisimova said in her on-court interview. She wasn't the only one; after Andreeva's final backhand went long, the 18-year-old bent double with the emotion.

""It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis,"" Anisimova continued. ""Seeing Mirra down like that, it's understandable. We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today. These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day.""

In her press conference, Anisimova expanded on her sympathy for Andreeva.

""It's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that,"" she said. ""It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her. Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things.""

Anisimova's victory was her first Top 10 win of 2026, and marks the first time she has reached a semifinal since the 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh. It was also the second time she has downed Andreeva in a nailbiter in as many meetings. Last year, she ended Andreeva's 13-match winning streak 7-6(5), 2-6, 6-3 in the Miami third round.

Pegula and Anisimova will both be bidding to reach the Dubai final for the first time. Pegula has dominated their head-to-head so far with a perfect 4-0 record, including a 6-2, 7-6(1) win in Melbourne last month.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Setting the stage for a third-set tug-of-war: As Andreeva advanced to a 6-2, 2-0 lead, the teenager's tactics and execution were both spot on. She was both out-manoeuvring the two-time major finalist from the baseline and out-serving her: in the first set, Andreeva fired four aces to Anisimova's zero, while the latter coughed up 20 unforced errors.

But with two points to go up a 3-0 double break, Andreeva threw in a pair of her own errors -- and a rejuvenated Anisimova cleaned up her accuracy to reel off five straight games and lead 5-2. Andreeva managed to rediscover her first-set form to level at 5-5, but lapsed into error again in the final game of the set.

The decider saw both players raise their levels at the same time. Andreeva, already up a break, won one of the best points of the match in the second game, anticipating an Anisimova putaway and stealing the rally with a lob-drop shot combination.

Anisimova expands her game to pull ahead: But getting tied up in that exchange seemed to only spur Anisimova on. She found her best sequence of no-holds-barred power hitting in response, and took five of the next seven games to lead 5-3. In this passage of play, Anisimova's willingness to come forwards proved crucial -- and she also pulled off a hot shot of her own, a one-handed backhand flick to finish a cat-and-mouse placement battle in the sixth game.

""I feel I'm always learning when you play matches like that,"" Anisimova said in her on-court interview. ""I'm expanding my game, and that's something I feel likeI really want to get better at.""

Most impressively, Anisimova's adjustments were made on the fly. Net play had not been part of her advance strategy.

""Before the match that wasn't really something in my mind,"" she said. ""But as the match went on, she gets to every single ball. So I felt like I was trying different things, like drop shots, coming into the net, trying to use the court as much as I can because otherwise I don't think that the point would finish if I just kept hitting the ball.

""It's something I've also tried to get better at and improve in. I feel like I can play well at the net if I commit to it ... We were just going back to back with it. We were both trying to play really aggressive. I feel like the game style shifted a lot of times throughout the match.""

Andreeva musters a last stand ... but Anisimova powers to victory: With her back to the wall, Andreeva refused to let go of her crown. With Anisimova serving at 5-3, Andreeva saved a match point by drawing the error with a short forehand slice. At 5-5, she nailed a pair of down-the-line winners off each wing to win a third straight game.

""When it was 5-5 I was like, damn, I had a match point at 5-3,"" Anisimova recalled in her press conference. ""How did you blow that? I was like, maybe I might lose the match at this point, too.

""It was just a flying thought in my mind. It didn't really stick long. I feel like we were both playing so well, so of course that's going to happen. I think Coco [Gauff] also saved a few match points last night. I ended up coming to watch that match in the end. I feel like the tennis here has been sort of a rollercoaster. That's also what makes this sport so enjoyable to watch. Yeah, the game can be crazy.""

Embracing the wild shifts made possible by tennis's scoring system, Anisimova made one last charge -- and victory ultimately came down to her ability to tee off on the Andreeva second serve. At 6-5, 30-30, Anisimova avoided facing a match point by hammering a forehand return down the line. Consecutive return winners also gave her the momentum early in the ensuing tiebreak.

Amanda Anisimova ended Mirra Andreeva's title defense at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships in the quarterfinals, coming through a nailbiter in a third-set tiebreak. She will face Jessica Pegula, who defeated last year's finalist Clara Tauson in three sets, in an all-American semifinal.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Last week, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 2 Iga Swiatek announced their withdrawal from the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, the second of back-to-back WTA 1000 events in the Middle East.Their absence renewed the conversation around how sustainable the professional tennis calendar really is—a discussion that only grew louder after eight other players also pulled out of the draw citing injury, illness and schedule changes, while four more players, including top seed Elena Rybakina, retired mid-match in Dubai.Read More: Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek Dubai withdrawals signal 'strategic scheduling' from top playersThe WTA's top players are largely in agreement that the calendar needs an overhaul—and now a new council has been formed to begin addressing the issue head on.On Tuesday, WTA Chair Valerie Camillo announced the launch of the 13-person Tour Architecture Council, whose goal is to recommend “actionable improvements” that could be implemented as early as the 2027 season.

According to Camillo, the Council will bring together prominent voices from across the global tennis ecosystem. It is made up of players from around the world, leaders from tournaments across the Americas, Europe and Asia, as well as WTA senior leadership—including Camillo and WTA CEO Portia Archer—and experts in Tour operations.The Council will be chaired by world No. 5 Jessica Pegula, who will help guide discussions so they reflect the “full range of different player experiences on Tour.”Pegula, who also serves on the WTA Player Council, explained the initiative to press in Dubai.“I know that the schedule is very tough, and it's not easy,” she told The National's Reem Abulleil. “I think at some point in the year, if you do have a few good results, some weeks unfortunately do become a little bit of a sacrifice if you're thinking long term.

""And I think right now we're living in an age where the priority is always staying healthy mentally and physically, and you never know where a player is at with that.“Even if they've been winning matches, you don't know if they've been dealing with an injury throughout that whole time or not.

What do Petra Kvitova and Barbora Krejcikova have in common? Two things, as many tennis fans know: they're both Czech, and they've both won two Grand Slam singles titles.But they shouldn't be the only active Czech ladies with that designation, according to Brad Gilbert.“I feel like she's the biggest ‘What if?' player on the women's tour,” says BG of Karolina Muchova, the recently crowned champion in Doha.The 29-year-old dropped just one set to win the 1000-level tournament, which for a while looked like Victoria Mboko's event to lose. But the surging Canadian teen—who had defeated Mirra Andreeva and Elana Rybakina just to reach the semifinals—couldn't handle Muchova's signature blend of all-court craftsmanship in the title bout.Yet despite having reached three Grand Slam semifinals, ascended as high as No. 8 in the world and posted a 338-163 win-loss record, this was just Muchova's second WTA-level title of any sort, and her first since 2019!I feel like she's the biggest ‘What if?' player on the women's tour.

Last week marked the first time in 44 years that three tournaments featured finals pitting the No. 1 seed vs. the No. 2 seed:Dallas: (1) Taylor Fritz vs. (2) Ben SheltonRotterdam: (1) Alex de Minaur vs. (2) Felix Auger-AlassimeBuenos Aires: (1) Francisco Cerundolo vs. (2) Luciano DarderiFrom an American perspective, at least, the highlight was Fritz vs. Shelton, which Andrea Petkovic lauded—especially their final set.“It was exciting, the quality was great, the men were moving incredibly well,” she said. “I was very impressed.”

“It was exciting, the quality was great, the men were moving incredibly well,” she said. “I was very impressed.”

The drama also played into the appraisal. Fritz had three match points, but couldn't capitalize on any. They were all on Shelton's serve—and to Fritz's credit, he returned each one and engaged in a rally—but painfully came up short.“When you get a tournament win like that,” said Gilbert of Shelton, “the next place that you go to…you get in a same situation, I'm going to find another win.”WATCH: Should Fritz, playing through injury, take some time off?

Players are getting burnt out, and I think that's the worst thing that can happen to a sport. Coco Vandeweghe

The 2025 tennis season saw the highest percentage of mid-tournament withdrawals and retirements on records. And despite advances in health technology, sports science and medicine, there were 25 percent more retirements on the ATP and 50 percent on the WTA, compared to 20 years ago.While acknowledging the outsized length of the calendar, Gilbert also felt some players were retiring when they really didn't have to—and worse, playing shortly after.“There should be some sort of penalty for retiring, because you screwed the fans—you couldn't have been that bad, you played the next week,” said BG. “They need to look at that.”Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek (neither of whom retired last week) aren't playing this week in Dubai, a 1000-level tournament, nor are Doha finalists Muchova and Mboko. Everyone is seemingly looking for answers.“You blame the tours more than you blame the tournaments,” says Vandeweghe, noting that both tournaments were elevated to mandatory 1000s. “It makes it impossible for the women to pick and choose what they want. If you don't play these two 1000s, then you have to put the load at the end of the year.”

Everyone is seemingly looking for answers.“You blame the tours more than you blame the tournaments,” says Vandeweghe, noting that both tournaments were elevated to mandatory 1000s. “It makes it impossible for the women to pick and choose what they want. If you don't play these two 1000s, then you have to put the load at the end of the year.”

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

Kimi Antonelli sets the fastest lap of day 5 of Bahrain testing

With the second pre-season test in Bahrain fast approaching, Ferrari's Fred Vasseur is anticipating several significant upgrades across the field.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur is “convinced” that most teams will “bring huge upgrades” to the second pre-season test in Bahrain, with the Frenchman also setting out his expectations for how the development race could initially unfold.

Prior to the 2026 season getting underway – in which a wave of new technical regulations have been introduced – Vasseur suggested that the Scuderia would bring a “spec A” version of their challenger to the Barcelona Shakedown and pre-season testing in order to gain mileage before later focusing on performance.

With the first of two tests at the Bahrain International Circuit now complete, Ferrari completed a solid lap number of laps across the three days of action – with only McLaren and Williams holding higher lap counts – and Vasseur was left feeling positive about what the squad achieved.

Pushed on whether he felt that the “spec A” plan had worked well, the team boss responded: “Yeah, on this side I would say so far so good, that we did something like 4,500km so far.

“It went pretty well on the reliability side, and it's the best way to collect data and to try to understand what are the options and how we can improve the car step by step. We are not speaking at all about performance so far, but everybody is focused on themselves.

“We can't make any comparison, but so far it went well on our side to build up the knowledge of the car step by step. It's still a long way to go.”

After bringing new parts to the SF-26 during the opening Bahrain test, Vasseur believes that most of the field will continue to do this when the second test takes place from February 18-20.

“I'm really convinced that everybody will bring huge upgrades next week and perhaps again in Melbourne,” he explained.

“And it will be like this at the beginning of the season because the rate of development is very, very high and it makes sense to speed up the new parts and the lead time on the new parts, but I'm focused on myself.”

In terms of how happy he is with where Ferrari are currently at with their pre-season programme, Vasseur added: “You always want to do more – you always want to do more laps, but overall I think it went pretty well, that we didn't have any big issue on the reliability, that we didn't stop the car so far.

“This is good – we have a good correlation, it's positive. But it's nothing about performance – it's about the quality of work that we are doing in the development.”

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

Kimi Antonelli sets the fastest lap of day 5 of Bahrain testing

TWG Motorsports boss Dan Towriss has shared news on the timescale for Cadillac's own power unit.

Cadillac have shared an update on when they expect to debut their own power unit in F1, with the new team still focused on their original target of 2029 whilst acknowledging that they will “speed up” the process if there are ways to do so.

After Cadillac's entry for 2026 received its final approval in March 2025, it was confirmed one month later that GM Performance Power Units LLC. – founded by TWG Motorsports and General Motors to build powertrains for the Formula 1 team – had been officially approved as an F1 power unit supplier starting in 2029 by the FIA.

Speaking to a select group of media, including F1.com, TWG Motorsports boss Dan Towriss was quizzed ahead of the team's 2026 debut on whether this timescale for the engines was still the plan, with his response being that the hope is for Cadillac's own power unit to be up and running “as soon as possible”.

“We're really following the conversation on the [regulations] closely,” Towriss explained. “It's possible that the regulations could change before 2031, it's possible that they don't change before 2031.

“Regardless of the funding, I think it's important that we see a Cadillac power unit on the grid as soon as possible, and so that's really the main focus from my standpoint. If there are ways to speed it up, we will, but right now the focus is still 2029.”

Towriss also shared news on how work is progressing on the team's new United States headquarters in Fishers, Indiana, which will run alongside their European facility next to the Silverstone track.

“We're hoping that construction to wrap up later this year or in the first quarter of 2027, as we continue to get the building right and figure out exactly the manufacturing components that are going to be there, so we're super excited,” said Towriss.

“That's going to be a state-of-the-art facility. Right now a lot of the teams that are in that location are working out of temporary office space as we complete the design there.”

And while Cadillac's own power unit will not make an appearance just yet, the team's engines and gearboxes are being supplied by Ferrari in the meantime.

Pushed on how the American outfit have found the experience of working with the Scuderia, Towriss responded: “Ferrari's been great to work with.

“Fred [Vasseur] and his team have been really good and supportive from that standpoint, even through Barcelona [Shakedown], so we're very happy with the Ferrari relationship and how that's going.”

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

Kimi Antonelli sets the fastest lap of day 5 of Bahrain testing

Mark Hughes takes a closer look at the unusual features spotted on Ferrari's car during the second pre-season test in Bahrain.

Ferrari generated plenty of attention on the first day of the second pre-season test in Bahrain thanks to their unusual vane (termed a flow turning device by the team) located behind the exhaust. On the second day they continued to get people talking with a radical flip rear wing element, which rotates itself upside down in straight line mode.

Technical contributor Mark Hughes delves into each of these designs to examine what they are intended to do...

Ferrari's 'flow turning device' is located close to the bottom of the wing assembly. It is roughly square in section – and aligned with the gap ahead between the two rear wing pillars – and is angled very steeply upwards.

It appears to be directing exhaust flow to the underside of the rear wing main plane, but it is almost certainly also energising the airflow exiting the diffuser in that central part of its width.

However, this unique feature is built upon another – one that was already on the car in the first Bahrain test: lower bodywork which extends the diffuser expansion ramp further back than the regulation rearmost point for the diffuser. This bodywork – separate from the actual physical diffuser – effectively makes the diffuser longer and therefore more effective in speeding up the underfloor's airflow and thereby increasing downforce.

It seems such an obvious benefit that it begs the question as to why only Ferrari have done it. The answer lies in the Ferrari's differential and driveshafts.

The complex series of dimensional boxes to which the bodywork must comply stipulate that any bodywork in this lower section of the car can extend back no more than 6cm from the driveshafts. On other cars, 6cm back from the driveshafts would still be within the diffuser region.

However, Ferrari has placed the diff so far back and angled its driveshafts back to such an extreme degree that it opens out this extra volume behind the diffuser in which the aerodynamic-aiding bodywork has been made possible.

The regulations stipulate that the diff can be sited plus or minus 6cm from the rear axle line. Ferrari had chosen to put it the maximum 6cm back so as to create the volume behind the diffuser in which to fit the extra diffuser-enhancing bodywork.

The technical limitation on how far the driveshafts can be angled is formed by the constant velocity joints, which connect the gearbox to the differential and the driveshafts to the diff. They allow the driveshafts to rotate while accommodating the suspension's movement.

Accommodating angled driveshafts involves careful design of linkages to prevent vibration and failure. This in turn impacts upon the design of the whole transmission assembly, so copying the Ferrari layout during the season would not be feasible for other teams. The Haas and Cadillac cars however use the Ferrari gearbox so, in theory, they might be able to emulate the swept back driveshafts to take advantage of the bodywork loophole.

Using the diffuser-extending bodywork as the foundation, Ferrari has introduced this new vane to direct exhaust flow to the rear wing underside. The faster the air flows over the rear wing underside, the lower the air pressure there and the bigger the difference between the high pressure of the wing's top surface and the low pressure of the underside – boosting the downforce.

Exhaust blowing the wing underside is not a new technology – it featured on cars in the 2010s – but it was effectively outlawed by dimensional restrictions. The new set of dimensions of the 2026 regulations has opened up the possibility of doing it once more.

Ferrari has spotted this opportunity and incorporated it into the SF26, but the exhaust blowing is quite possibly just supplementary to the flow turning device's main function of speeding up flow from the diffuser. The faster the air flows over the top of the diffuser, the greater its pull on that coming through and this device will act as a gurney flap in that section of the diffuser-extending bodywork, which is restricted by the twin wing pillars, speeding up the more restricted flow in compensation.

Ferrari has apparently found an ingenious loophole with this diffuser-extending ruse and that is all the more valuable in how difficult it is to copy.

Rather than simply switching from an angled position to flat when in straightline mode, the new test item Ferrari was trying on the second day in Bahrain flips completely to an upside down position.

This appears to create a bigger slot gap for the air to travel through for a further reduction in drag. In normal downforce mode, the wing's upper surface is of a smaller surface area than the underside. It is this which creates the air pressure difference between above and below – and that, in turn, creates downforce.

With the wing flipped, the smaller surface area becomes the lower one – thereby creating more space in the gap than in a conventional flattened (but not upside-down) flap.

If successful, this will be easier to copy than the diffuser-extending bodywork but further illustrates the creative thinking going on at Maranello.

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

Kimi Antonelli sets the fastest lap of day 5 of Bahrain testing

Ferrari topped the timesheets over McLaren at the Bahrain International Circuit on Wednesday morning.

Charles Leclerc posted the fastest lap time as pre-season testing resumed on Wednesday – the Ferrari driver leading the way from McLaren's Lando Norris and the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli.

Leclerc worked his way down to a 1m 33.739s across the four hours of morning running at the Bahrain International Circuit, putting him three-tenths up on Norris and another tenth ahead of Antonelli.

All three will hand over to their respective team mates for the afternoon session in the Sakhir desert, with Hadjar currently the only driver scheduled to complete a full day of running aboard the Red Bull.

Haas' Esteban Ocon was the first driver out on track when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane at 1000 local time, with sizeable aerodynamic rakes – used to record valuable data – attached to plenty of cars.

Most other teams promptly followed suit, but Sergio Perez spent the opening hour or so stuck in the garage while Cadillac worked through sensor issues – his first installation lap coming around 75 minutes into the session.

As the morning progressed and drivers began to push the limits again, Nico Hulkenberg was seen dipping two wheels into the gravel after a slide, while both Fernando Alonso and sole 2026 rookie Arvid Lindblad both had wild moments through the final corner.

Behind the top three of Leclerc, Norris and Antonelli, Williams continued their recovery from missing the Barcelona Shakedown en route to P4 with Alex Albon, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly and the aforementioned Hadjar – who lost a chunk of track time due to work being carried out on the Red Bull – completing the top six.

Seventh went to early-starter Ocon, from Aston Martin's Alonso, Audi's Hulkenberg and Racing Bulls' Lindblad, who completed the most laps of the morning by charging his way through a race distance, with Perez bringing up the rear as he gradually got some laps on the board after those sensor delays.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to run through the morning data, take a break for lunch and work towards their afternoon programmes – as touched on, 10 of the 11 teams deciding to split their days and give both racers time at the wheel.

A provocative move by the director at the NBA All-Star Game only throws into relief what's been happening on screens, from the Olympics to the multiplex, this entertainment season.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	The first Jewish basketball player to make the NBA All Star-Game was Dolph Schayes, in 1951. Schayes would go on to make the next eleven, his two-handed arcing jump shot and lightning-quick drives to the basket turning the 6′ 8″ forward into a superstar.


	The most recent Jewish basketball player to make the NBA all-star game was Deni Avdija, an Israeli playing for the Portland Trailblazers who stands exactly as tall as Schayes did and drives just as fast. Avdija is having a breakout season, averaging 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists per game, numbers that helped land him the fifth-most All-Star fan votes in 2026, ahead of Victor Wembanyama and Kevin Durant.Avdija is no anomaly, at least not historically. Jews have deep roots in basketball, dominating the game in pre-War America, especially at the college level; one famous contest between undefeateds NYU and City College of New York in 1934 featured nine of ten Jewish starters and landed the nascent sport in Newsweek and The New York Times. As recent immigrants, Jews played the game in their dense urban neighborhoods and helped popularize it with traveling teams up and down the East Coast. That changed with migrations to the suburbs and as the game developed in new directions. But basketball has always been tied up with the Jewish-American experience.Needless to say, then, Avdija's appearance on the NBC telecast Sunday night — he notched five points and two assists in eight minutes for the World squad and caught the attention of LeBron James — was a source of pride for many Jews, who continue to play basketball in schools and recreationally perhaps more than any other sport. Among Jewish Americans this basketball season Avdija's performance has been a talking point everywhere from rec-league pickup games to family WhatApp groups. “Can you believe what he threw down last night?”It's unlikely Spike Lee knew all of that, though as a student of basketball, it's fair to assume he caught some of it. But he does know a thing or two about ethnic pride and identity, having made countless movies about the topic. And if none of that clocks, his longtime production office is a few blocks from the Barclays Center, home of the Brooklyn Nets, where two Israeli-backgrounded Jews, Danny Wolf and Ben Saraf, currently play.

	Which is why when he showed up courtside at the Intuit Dome Sunday night wearing a keffiyeh-patterned hoodie, a shoulder bag with the colors of the Palestinian flag and what appeared to be the infamous upside-down red triangle used by Hamas to identify the presence of Israeli soldiers, all seemingly to be in the eyeline of both Avdija and the millions of Jews watching him, it felt like an affront.Lee didn't say anything in a quick red-carpet walk in to the arena, and if you asked him, he might say he wasn't aiming it at Avdija and was just making a general political point. But he would be playing a fancy-footwork game worthy of Luka Dončić. The director gets to show up at the game and have the effect of provoking the Jewish player running up and down the court in front of him, even as he retains the ability to say he just happened to feel the need to get political that night.Supporting the Palestinian cause is Lee's right, of course, but no Palestinian was playing in the NBA All-Star Game. Protesting the Israeli government's actions in Gaza or anywhere else is also very much Lee's right, but no Israeli government officials or even national team was playing. The man who was playing was guilty of little more than being born in Israel, and for that he apparently deserved an ongoing in-game protest. Even the small Israel flag embossed on Avdija's jersey was no different from the flag worn by any other of the international stars, including Nikola Jokić, who grew up in Slobodan Milošević's Serbia, and Alperen Sengun, who was raised in Recep Erdoğan's Turkey, and had those flags on their jerseys. If Lee wore an article of clothing protesting their involvement in the game, I somehow missed it.

	[On Wednesday Lee posted that he did not know Avidija was Israeli and was simply making a statement independent of him. “Much Respect To Deni Avdija, The First Israeli-Born Player In The NBA All-Star Game. Congratulations Also To All The Players And The NBA. There Has Been Some Conjecture About What I Wore To The Games on Saturday and Sunday. The Clothes I Wore are Symbols of My Concern For The Palestinian Children and Civilians, And My Utmost Belief In Human Dignity For All Humankind,” Lee wrote. “What I Wore Was Not Intended As A Gesture Of Hostility To Jewish People Or To Support Violence Against Anyone, Nor Was It Intended As A Comment On The Significance Of Deni Being An All-Star. There Were 28 NBA Players Chosen To Be In LA This Weekend. I Didn't Know Them All And Deni Playing For The Portland Trailblazers, A West Coast Team, I Didn't Know Deni As The First Israeli Born NBA All-Star. He can BALL. NOW I DO KNOW. LIVE AND LEARN. ONWARD AND UPWARD PEACE AND LOVE YA-DIG? SHO-NUFF.”]


	A very different scene has been playing out for Jewish and Israeli athletes halfway around the world. In a record showing, Israel sent nine athletes to the Winter Olympics across five disciplines this year, up from six athletes at the Beijing Games. The country has exactly one mountain that regularly gets snow, but it has become a source for one of the feelgood stories of the Games courtesy of the Israeli bobsled team — led by AJ Edelman, brother of Alex Edelman, the Emmy-winning writer and performer of the HBO special  and Broadway hit Just For Us. AJ Edelman had taught himself how to skeleton and competed for Israel at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang; now he had pivoted to another sport and made the Olympics again. He and his two-man-bob teammate Menachem Chen stood at 26th out of 26 sleds halfway through the competition (where they would finish) but were still pumping their fists after their runs like they'd landed on the podium. As an NBC news story noted, “AJ Edelman and Menachem Chen are in last place out of 26 sleds at the midway point of the Olympic two-man bobsled race at the Milan Cortina Games. And they're thrilled.”There has been very little visible Spike-like protests of the Israeli athletes. A commentator for the Swiss broadcaster RTS did say on-air that, because Edelman was pro-Israel, “one can therefore question his presence in Cortina during these Games,” but RTS had the good sense to take the comments down, even if they didn't exactly denounce them.And then there's Marty Supreme, which has been beaconing Jewish pride since Christmas Day, its title character competing not just with the Jewish stereotype of smarts but with stamina and skill, a ferocious athleticism. The scene has been striking: A Jewish actor playing a Jewish sports legend to millions of non-Jews who don't bat an eye.Jews excited about Jews in sports is a strange and, yes, sometimes funny beast. On one hand, the enthusiasm almost undermines its own point; if such an event were actually common it wouldn't be celebrated with such gusto. (See under: the classic Airplane! bit “how about this leaflet, famous Jewish sports legends?”) On the other hand, for many Jews a genuinely deep, almost existential thrill comes from such a sight.Partly that's because any of us intramural or beer-league legends want to imagine that, but for a twist of fate, it could be us winning gold or draining the Game 7 winner, and how much more realistic if the athlete who does sits down at the same seder table. But it of course goes deeper than that, to the same issues of representation that echo through much of Hollywood — of seeing someone who looks like you excelling at something you've rarely seen them excel at, then taking that improbable inspiration into your own life on a smaller stage.That's why Edelman and Chen's bobsled runs have been so miraculous. Ice and snow sports? Where you jet down a mountain at death-tempting F1 speeds? That requires a WASPish pedigree, not to mention a Jewish mother who has been medically induced into a coma. We never see Jews doing that. And yet here some were, under Olympic lights. When Alex Edelman took a good-natured dig at his brother in Just For Us at how good AJ was at a sport that only about 50 people in the world competed in, it got a laugh for the enjoyable snark but also a little nod of pride that AJ was doing something so rare in the first place. (Just for Us has been leaning in to the younger Edelman's Italy competitions on social.)But the sight of a Jew excelling in sports is even more than a bit of representational inspiration. So much of antisemitism, historic and resurgent, is bound up with demeaning Jews as genetically inferior — at the top line with Hitler and those infamous Olympics 90 years ago but also much more casually, in easy jokes and schoolyard assumptions, in the implication that genetic makeup makes Jews less athletic. (Funny how some of the same people trading in these stereotypes also paint Jewish soldiers as fierce goons; who says hate has to be consistent?) And so the sight of Jewish-Americans Aerin Frankel, the goalie on the unstoppable U.S women's hockey team, pitching three shutouts and counting, or dominant speed skater Emery Lehman, who just won silver in the men's team pursuit on Tuesday, resoundingly shuts down the argument. The U.S. men's hockey team is anchored by the wizardry of star forward Jack Hughes and his brother Quinn Hughes back on the blue line. Both are Jewish, the sons of women's hockey pioneer Ellen Weinberg.Even the greatest slalom skier of all time, Mikaela Shiffrin who, OK, she's a little harder to claim, but would've been Jewish enough to pass the old Nazi test.And, of course, the Israeli bobsled team, aka “shul runnings.” The pun is great. The story is even better.Taking in all these great sights on so many screens has the effect of marginalizing a Spike Lee and his apparent belief that a Jewish athlete exists only as a vessel for his virtue-signal fashions; the director deserves no more emotional energy than a whatever eye-roll for his performative narcissism. Lee can't kill the mood of anyone excited about Jewish sports swagger. He can just remind us why it's needed.

Shia LaBeouf's arrest in New Orleans in the early hours of Tuesday, as the city's Mardi Gras celebrations were underway, is facing fresh scrutiny, as an alleged victim of the actor's rampage that night says he was targeted in the confrontation, which he is characterizing as an alleged hate crime.


	The altercation that took place 15 minutes after midnight at R Bar in the city's Faubourg Marigny neighborhood — video of which circulated widely online, showing a belligerent LaBeouf's Jekyll and Hyde display as he was restrained outside the bar — left two bartenders injured and the actor facing two counts of simple assault; he was quickly released by early afternoon Tuesday on his own recognizance. He is due back in court on March 19.

	Jeffrey “Dammit,” a longtime local fixture and master of ceremonies at various New Orleans events, is also a Screen Actors Guild member who now resides and works in Hollywood most of the year. He told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday that he makes multiple trips back to New Orleans annually; he first moved to The Big Easy in 1995 and over the years, has taken various bartending jobs, including at R Bar. He said that his initial confrontation with the Transformers star began hours before the now-viral street scuffle.

	“He smashed into me, knocking me into some boxes,” Jeffrey explained of his first encounter with LaBeouf around 5 p.m. on Monday. “Then he turned around screaming, ‘Don't you fucking push me. I'll kill you.' I hadn't touched him.” Jeffrey said he attempted to defuse the situation but alleges LaBeouf escalated things, putting a finger in his face and calling him a homophobic slur.

	











	“He said he'd ‘kick my ass' and called me a faggot,” Jeffrey said. “I told him I wasn't going to fight him. I wasn't giving him that.”


	LaBeouf was in and out of the bar throughout Monday evening and appeared highly intoxicated. When he returned to the bar around midnight, he recalled, the situation had intensified.


	“He was screaming at a bartender and had to be escorted outside,” Jeffrey said. “Once outside, he started pacing in the street, yelling, ‘You're all a bunch of fucking faggots. I'll kick your ass.'” Jeffrey said he briefly intervened when a shirtless LaBeouf lunged at a staff member.


	“I grabbed him and held him for less than a minute so he wouldn't beat up the bartender,” he said. “The bartender told me to let go, and I did.”


	Moments later, he alleges, LaBeouf punched a second bartender in the face, breaking his nose. Video clips from outside the bar show LaBeouf being restrained as he continues shouting. 


	“He kept trying to get up and fight people,” Jeffrey said. “He wouldn't stop screaming slurs. That's why I say this wasn't just a bar fight. This was about hate.”


	Police, who he said had to be flagged down to quell the scene, took statements from Jeffrey and at least one R Bar bartender. LaBeouf was transported from the scene and later released on his own recognizance, according to court records. New videos circulated on social media showing the actor dancing on Bourbon Street after his release, with the actor holding his jail release paperwork in his mouth.

	











	Jeffrey said the speed of that release surprised him.


	“In decades of coming to Mardi Gras, I've always understood that if you go to jail during Mardi Gras, you're not getting out until after Ash Wednesday,” he said. “The only thing I'm surprised about is that anybody else would have been in jail.”


	He added that the decision to release LaBeouf quickly “sends a terrible message” about accountability during one of the city's busiest weeks.


	Beyond the physical confrontation, Jeffrey said that the slurs and threats are what linger most.


	“Anytime somebody insists on calling me a ‘faggot' and threatening to hurt me because of it —  that's not something you ever get used to,” he said. “I've worked in bars for years. I've seen fights. But when someone is screaming that word over and over while trying to attack people, that's different.”


	He also expressed concern about professional fallout, noting that both he and LaBeouf work in the entertainment industry.


	“I would not feel safe running into him on a set,” he said. “If he could make a call and get out of jail before anybody else, what's stopping him from making a call about my career?” LaBeouf recently claimed to be sober and blamed past abusive behavior on alcoholism. Before his arrest in New Orleans on Tuesday, he went on an extended-weekend bar crawl during Mardi Gras in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood, according to employees of various drinking establishments.

Abrams is producing the feature that has Mollner back in the director's chair for the first time since his breakout 'Strange Darling.'


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Sony has come out on top of a bidding war for Skeletons, a thriller that has JJ Abrams on board to produce and Brie Larson attached to star. The studio beat out Paramount, Warner Bros. and Neon for the project, which was also selling at the European Film Market.


	Sony's deal is for worldwide rights.




	What makes the interest in the project even spicier is the involvement of JT Mollner, the filmmaker behind Strange Darling. He co-wrote the script and is attached to direct.

	Mollner has emerged as rising filmmaking talent in the mold of a Zech Cregger (Weapons) and Parker Finn (Smile), an original voice in the genre space. Mollner wrote and directed Strange Darling, a non-linear thriller that, while not a box office hit, cemented him as a filmmaker with whom studios are deeply keen to work. He wrote last year's acclaimed adaptation of Stephen King's The Long Walk, but did not direct it. Studios have been waiting for his next move.

	











	Many of Skeletons plot details are being kept in the closet. It is understood, however, to focus on the relationship between a son and his mother, with the latter being mysteriously placed in a secure cage each night.


	The initial draft was written by Brian Duffield, who wrote No One Will Save You (which he also directed) and Love and Monsters. The project is based on a short story by Philip Fracassi and at one point was previously known as Fail-Safe.


	The project hit the town last week and generated immediate bids, according to sources. At the same time, the project was selling at the European Film Market. The initial plan by FilmNation Entertainment, WME and CAA was to sell it by individual territories. Sony, however, came in aggressively to take worldwide rights.

	











	It was not immediately clear where financial figures are landing, but it is at least in the mid-$20 million range for domestic rights. Sources say the figures for worldwide are higher.


	Abrams has been relatively quiet on the feature front since making 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, focusing much of his attention on television. He did, however, produce documentaries The Blue Angels and Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes, as well as the Allison Janney Netflix thriller Lou.


	Larson's last big-screen entry was Marvel Studios' ill-fated The Marvels and she also starred in Apple TV's prestige mini-series Lessons in Chemistry.


	Larson is repped by WME and Sloane Offer. Mollner is repped by UTA and Jackoway Austen.


	Worldwide acquisitions president Joe Matukewicz,  exec VP of business affairs Virginia Longmuir, and VP of business development Elan Kovo are negotiating the deal for Sony.

	Chateau Amiri, California is open for business.


	The Los Angeles-based luxury fashion brand founded by Mike Amiri has launched a new spring-summer campaign dubbed Chateau Amiri, California and drafted actors Danny Ramirez and Michael Imperioli to check in alongside multi-hyphenate Malcolm McRae and models Jordan Daniels and Heather Diamond Strongarm. 




	They were tasked with playing “a heightened, imagined version of themselves” for photographer Hart Leshkina and director Bon Duke who captured the campaign inside the faux hotel, which was designed to pay homage “to the haunts and locales” that have shaped the modern mythology of Hollywood, per Amiri. The brand's founder, Mike Amiri, who launched the label in 2014, explained it a little further.

	“Character is the starting point for everything I create, shaped by cinema, the soul of Hollywood. Our Amiri campaigns have become spaces to explore this idea — creating immersive worlds of still and motion pictures, where our collections come to life with new context, different stories,” said Amiri. “Building on that universe we're crafting, this season we welcome you, and a cast of true stars, into the Chateau Amiri.” 


	The campaign features the models outfitted in fits from Amiri's spring-summer collection, accessorized by martinis, sunglasses, room keys, hand bags and more framed by hotel suites, lobbies and pools. See below for shots from the campaign.


	Imperioli is best known for his starring turn opposite James Gandolfini on the iconic Sopranos. More recently, he's been seen in Song Sung Blue, The Nice Guys, The White Lotus and The Many Saints of Newark. Ramirez meanwhile is best known for his work in Top Gun: Maverick, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Captain America: Brave New World and The Last of Us. He'll next be seen in Avengers: Doomsday. Rocker McRae had a role on Daisy Jones and the Six.

The Boss' beef with the Trump administration is cooking.  


													By
												

	Lars Brandle



	The United States simply isn't big enough for two bosses. That's one takeaway from a new missive from the White House, which has dismissed Bruce Springsteen as a “loser” with “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and an atrophying brain, doing so by way of a statement.


	With the announcement that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will head back out on the Land of Hope and Dreams American tour, the White House is chiming in. Only this time, the titles of several choice Springsteen work are woven in for added effect.

	











	“When this loser Springsteen comes back home to his own City of Ruins in his head, he'll realize his Glory Days are behind him and his fans have left him Out in the Street, putting him in a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out because he has a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his brain,” reads the message from White House comms director Steven Cheung, issued to Politico.


Billboard has reached out to Springsteen for comment.


	The iconic rocker had laid into the Trump administration in January with his anti-ICE song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” inspired by what the Rock Hall-inducted singer called the “state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis” in a statement at the time.


	Specifically, the song called out the killings of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti, both 37, who were gunned down in Minneapolis by immigration enforcement troops in the midst of the so-called Operation Metro Surge enforcement action that has seen thousands of border patrol and ICE agents descend on the city.

	











Springsteen found himself back at No. 1 with “Streets of Minneapolis,” which debuted atop Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart dated Feb. 7. It was the highest selling song in the United States for the week, even with it being available for just two days of the tracking cycle.


	The White House had words at the time, one of which was to snub Springsteen as “irrelevant.”


	Springsteen is many things, but a “loser” — as the administration has referred to him — isn't one of them. Across a 40 year-plus career, the rocker has collected 20 Grammys, won an Oscar and a Tony, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, received a Kennedy Center Honor and, in November 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And his album sales are north of 150 million, reps say.


	After 129 shows, the Springsteen and E Street Band 2023-25 tour grossed $729.7 million and sold 4.9 million tickets, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, for the biggest result of his career.


	The rock legend embarks on his 20-date arena outing at Minneapolis' Target Center on March 31, and ends with one stadium show on May 27 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.


	“We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” said Springsteen in a statement Tuesday (Feb. 17) when announcing the forthcoming tour.


	He added, “We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock n' Rebellion! I'll see you there!”

While the judge dismissed parts of the case, he said a jury might find that ""artists were coerced into going with Live Nation.""


	A federal judge on Wednesday (Feb. 18) refused to dismiss the Justice Department's sweeping monopoly lawsuit against Live Nation, sending the case to trial next month.


	Live Nation had asked Judge Arun Subramanian to end the antitrust lawsuit, which aims to break up the company from its Ticketmaster subsidiary, arguing the feds had uncovered little hard evidence after more than a year of discovery.


	But in his ruling, the judge said the government could proceed to trial on several key accusations, including that Live Nation abused its vast portfolio of amphitheaters to force artists to use its promotion services.


	“A reasonable jury could certainly find that artists were coerced into going with Live Nation as their promoter to get into its amphitheaters,” Judge Subramanian wrote in allowing those claims, known as “tying,” to move ahead.


	The judge also refused to dismiss the DOJ's accusation that Live Nation has forced venues into exclusively using Ticketmaster as their primary ticketing service, preventing rival services from growing into challengers.


	“Taking all this together, a jury must decide whether the exclusive contracts are the product of coercion (as there's some evidence for) or venue preference (as there's some evidence for),” the judge wrote.


	Though he allowed the case to move ahead, the judge threw out some other key monopoly claims focused on concert booking and the fan experience. He held that the DOJ failed to properly define a nationwide market for fans, dooming those claims, and that there's no evidence of Live Nation harming both arenas and amphitheaters with a booking-services monopoly.


	Dan Wall, Live Nation's head of corporate and regulatory affairs, said in a statement Wednesday that the company is “grateful” the judge narrowed the case and that “with those claims gone, we see no possible basis for breaking up Live Nation and Ticketmaster.”


	“We look forward to addressing the remaining claims at trial,” added Wall. “The deficiencies we identified in the government's monopoly power and conduct claims have not gone away, and we continue to believe that we will prevail in the end.”


	The DOJ declined to comment on the ruling. A jury trial is currently scheduled to begin on March 2.


	The DOJ and dozens of states filed the case in 2024, with an aim to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster over accusations that they form an illegal monopoly over the live music industry. The feds alleged Live Nation runs an illegal “flywheel” — reaping revenue from ticket buyers, using that money to sign artists, then leveraging that repertoire to lock venues into exclusive ticketing contracts that yield ever more revenue.


	In October, after more than 15 months of discovery, Live Nation moved for a so-called summary judgment ruling, arguing there was “barely a molehill” of evidence that it had done anything monopolistic. The DOJ disagreed, arguing it had uncovered numerous examples of the company abusing its market power.


	In his ruling allowing the primary ticketing accusations to move ahead on Wednesday, Judge Subramanian pointed to “evidence of coercion” — including “specific instances in which Ticketmaster appears to have threatened venues by conditioning access to artists on the venues picking Ticketmaster as the ticketer.”


	“Although Live Nation argues that these threats aren't specific to exclusivity, a jury could find that it was understood that going with Live Nation meant going with an exclusive deal,” the judge wrote.

EXCLUSIVE: French-language drama series The Hunt (Traqués) will debut on Apple TV on March 4. That is three months after the acquired series from Gaumont was slated to premiere on Dec. 3 but was delayed, with the French production company launching an investigation into claims that the show may have been plagiarized.


	In a statement, Gaumont laid out the sequence of events and revealed the outcome of its review related to the series' IP.

Originally scheduled for December 2025, The Hunt‘s release was postponed after it was identified in November 2025 that the project, presented as an original work, was based on an existing work, Douglas Fairbairn's Shoot.As soon as this information came to its attention, Gaumont, the series' producer, immediately took the necessary steps to identify the rights holders, and obtain the required authorizations.Respect for works and authors' rights is a fundamental principle for Gaumont, which can only be exercised with the trust and transparency of creative artists.


	The last part is a likely reference to The Hunt‘s director Cédric Anger who was originally credited as creator of the series when it was sold to Apple TV as an original project. Once Apple was made aware of plot similarities between The Hunt and Fairbairn's 1973 novel Shoot (as well as the 1976 U.S./Canadian movie of the same name), the streamer notified Gaumont while putting the show's release on hold two weeks before its scheduled debut.

	The similarities were clearly significant as The Hunt is now billed as “a series by Anger based on the novel Shoot by Douglas Fairbairn, which was first adapted into a feature film of the same name, directed by Harvey Hart from a screenplay by Richard Berg.”


	The adjustment follows deals that Gaumont has made with the rights holders of the book and film. (Fairbairn died in 1997). 


	Information about the show, which had been removed following the original premiere date delay, has now been restored on Apple's site and the app with the revised credits.


	In The Hunt, Franck (Benoît Magimel) and his longtime friends enjoy spending their weekends hunting together, but one Sunday, they come across another group of hunters who start targeting them without explanation. When one of their party is shot, Franck's friends strike back, sending an attacker to the ground. Barely managing to escape, the four friends keep the event a secret. Franck tries to go back to his life as usual alongside his wife Krystel (Mélanie Laurent), but in the next few days, he starts to feel like he and his friends are being watched, or worse, tracked by hunters who are now hell-bent on revenge.

	











	Damien Bonnard, Manuel Guillot, Cédric Appietto and Frédéric Maranber also star.


	The six-episode, one-hour series is executive produced by Sidone Dumas, Isabelle Degeorges, Clémentine Vaudaux and Alexis Barqueiro, through Gaumont. (This is the same quartet of EPs as before.) Anger directs five episodes, and Guillaume Renusson directs Episode 3. The first two episodes of The Hunt will debut globally on March 4, followed by one new episode every Wednesday through April 1.

Editor-In-Chief


SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about Season 3 of Netflix‘s The Night Agent.


	For two seasons, The Night Agent‘s Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) had Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) by his side — to protect, to lean on — and eventually fall in love with. In Season 3, he is going it alone. As Buchanan revealed to Deadline in September, she was not invited back for Season 3 of Netflix's political thriller.


	Instead, Peter was paired up with tenacious financial reporter Isabel (Genesis Rodriguez) — whose father turned out to be none other than the shady intelligence broker Jacob Monroe (Louis Herthum) — to uncover a conspiracy and corruption that goes all the way to the White House.

	











	Rose's departure was not entirely surprising — Peter told her at the end of Season 2 to stay away and not contact him again for her own safety. Still, Rose has proven time and time again that she is not very good at following directions, making a Season 3 return by her plausible — and welcomed by fans.


	“In the writers room, we certainly discussed it, in fact, that was our starting position: What would a Peter-Rose-centric story in Season 3 look like?,” The Night Agent creator/showrunner Shawn Ryan said. “There were moments in that conversation that felt a little derivative of the first couple seasons. And then we challenged ourselves, what would it look like without Rose the season, and we came up with a lot of what you see in Season 3. So it was completely a creative decision.”

	











	Added Ryan, “I love Luciane as an actress, I love her as a person, and if and when we have the right storyline for her we'll beg her to come back to the show. But in this case, we came up with the idea of Isabel as Jacob Monroe's estranged daughter, the financial world, which is not Rose's world at all. The concept of all these awful things that happen in the world couldn't really be happening without the cooperation and protection of these financial institutions, it felt like we needed a character in that world, and then obviously the character having the connection — as [Isabel] did — to Monroe, that felt like the best story for us.”


	Ryan is aware how invested fans are in Rose as a character and Peter and Rose as a couple, with many voicing their disappointment over Buchanan's exit.


	“Yeah, I know it's a topic,” he said. “I don't mind answering it, because my answer has always been consistent. I love Luciane and I'd love to see Rose on the show again at some point. This was the best story that we felt we could tell.”


	Season 3 of The Night Agent featured several direct and indirect references to Rose, her whereabouts and her relationship with Peter.


	In the season opener, which picks up almost a year after the Season 2 finale, Deputy Director Aiden Mosely (Ward Horton) asked Peter if the two are still in touch.


	“No, but it's safer for her,” Peter replied.


	Peter also mentioned in two different instances that there was someone he “cared about” that he “couldn't make it work” and whom Monroe threatened last season.


	While never mentioned by name, Rose came up in several conversations between Peter and Isabel.


	In their very first encounter at an Istanbul bar in Episode 1, they chatted over a local performer's song, which, fittingly for Peter and Rose's history, told the story of two lovers who were doomed because they were going in different directions.


	“Your fault or hers?,” Isabel asked Peter about his own doomed romance. “It was mine, it was definitely mine,” he said. “My job got in the way.”


	“She didn't break my heart,” Peter told Isabel over a game of pool in a subsequent episode. “We just can't be together.”


	He also brought up Rose when asked how he got through being falsely accused.


	“I had a partner, someone who believed me,” he said. “Sometimes that's enough.”


	All in all, Rose Larkin was only mentioned by name twice in Season 3, by Mosely in the premiere and when Monroe leveled a fresh threat that “my next bonfire will be in California over Rose Larkin's house” if Peter did not cooperate.


	This kind of defied the purpose of Peter asking Rose to stay away for her own protection and so she won't be used to get to him.


	“While Rose isn't in Season 3, her presence still hangs over Peter from off Season 3,” Ryan said about that. “I don't think Peter's over her, and it wasn't a case of, oh, well, let's eject her, and let's just bring in a new girl, and he'll fall for her, and we'll just lean into those tropes. That wasn't of interest to us, and I think Peter made a mistake thinking that doing this would remove any risk to her. I think that's the realization that he has to face, and by the end of the season, he's thinking about, how do I achieve some balance in my life between the various things that I want. So that was of interest to us to explore as well.”

	











	Basso also spoke about Rose's presence in Season 3 as well as the impact of her absence on Peter.


	“Rose might not be present physically, but she is a presence mentally,” he said. “She was a very significant person for Peter, and I don't think that he's the kind of person that just forgets things and moves on. So she might not be there on screen, but she's definitely still a motivating factor in his life. And I think he's definitely taking away things that she's told him and applying them to his situation in Season 3. She might be back in Season 4. Chelsea came back for Season 3.”


	Added Basso, “I think that these people that are in his life, that are important to him, he doesn't just forget about because they're off screen. Yeah, I think he did a good job. It's tough, but I think it removed an element of hesitancy for him; now he's able to fully be this, and he's figuring out that the demand is high.”

	Ryan also used the example of Fola Evans-Akingbola, who plays Secret Service Agent Chelsea, a series regular in Season 1 who was not in Season 2 save for a cameo in the finale to set up her Season 3 series regular return as a blueprint for what might happen with Buchanan.


	“I don't think it necessarily means no more Rose ever on The Night Agent,” he said. “I think we've established ourselves as a show that each season delves into a different world with different things going on. Chelsea was a big part of Season 1. She was just in one little scene at the end of Season 2, and then she came back in a major role in Season 3.”


	As Deadline reported in November, The Night Agent was awarded a California tax credit, so if the series is renewed for a fourth season, it will be set in the Golden State, which is where Rose happens to live too.


	Asked whether this is a clue to a potential Rose return, Ryan clarified that she technically lives in the Bay area while Season 4 would take place in Los Angeles. And, while he confirmed that he and his writers plan to bring back other characters besides Peter, Ryan remained mum on whether Rose may be one of them.


	He did make it clear though that Buchanan is not under contract anymore. Like all series regulars, the show had an option on her for Season 3. When a decision was made not to have her back, she was released from that option.


	“So if and when the time came that we wanted Rose back, we'd have to go to Luciane and say, hey, we have an idea,” Ryan said. “Now, when I talked to her about that decision after Season 2, I was very clear with her, Hey, this doesn't necessarily mean the end of you on the show. And there very well may be a time where I call and beg you to come back, whether it's for a whole season, whether it's for an episode or two, whatever. I believe that she enjoyed Rose on the show, and I'd like to think she'd do it but she's earning the right to make that decision herself at this point.”


	In her interview with Deadline, Buchanan also was hopeful about a possible return. 


	“If there is an opportunity that makes sense to the story for her to come back, I'm sure they'll explore that, because they really loved the dynamics of Peter and Rose, and I know a lot of audiences loved that dynamic,” she said. “So I'm sure Shawn Ryan and his team will find a little way; maybe we'll make a little cameo along the way.”

	











	Peter did not have a love interest in Season 3. His relationship with Isabel never became romantic, through there was some ambiguity in the finale, with her telling him that she was going to Spain as he revealed that he was taking time off, leaving things open for the duo.


	“I don't think there is ambiguity, he's not joining her in Spain,” Ryan said. “That's the way I view it. If you thought there was ambiguity, that's an entirely valid viewpoint. I personally didn't think that we were suggesting that he was going to go off with Isabel to Spain.”


	Basso also weighed in on Peter not developing a relationship with Isabel and whether he will swear off romance for the rest of his career so he does not put anybody else at risk.


	“He still loves Rose,” he said. “I don't think he is this character that's like, oh, Rose isn't here, so I'm gonna do this. I think he wants a relationship, but at this point in his life and how important he sees this job and rooting out corruption and doing the right thing, I think that ultimately is more important to him than having a relationship. But I think if anyone, he would probably try to find Rose again and track her down and see what happens with that.”


	Until then, Basso is staying in touch with Buchanan. 


	“We text every now and then, I texted her during the season,” he said. “Everybody missed her. Everybody on set loves her, she was great to have, and her presence as Luciane was missed for sure.”

International TV Co-Editor


UPDATED 4:09 AM: King Charles III has responded to the unprecedented arrest of his brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.


	“The law must take its course,” the King said in a statement. He added that he “learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.”


	“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” he added. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.”

	











	He declined comment further but said “my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” King Charles has barely spoken with his brother since the release of the Epstein Files, and he recently stripped him of his Prince title.

PREVIOUSLY, 2:41 AM: The man formerly known as Prince Andrew has been arrested.


	BBC News is reporting that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, which is the first time a modern Royal has been arrested and represents a watershed moment. 


	Andrew's association with the pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein has dominated headlines for weeks and BBC News reported that Thames Valley Police said they were assessing a complaint over the alleged sharing of confidential material by the former Prince with late sex offender Epstein. This morning, photos showed cars arriving at his estate in Norfolk.

	











	A Thames Valley Police statement confirmed that a “man in his sixties from Norfolk” had been arrested “on suspicion of misconduct in public office,” adding that it is “carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.”


	“The man remains in police custody at this time,” added the police. 


RELATED: Chappell Roan Exits Casey Wasserman's Music Empire Over L.A. Olympics Boss' Epstein Files Revelations: “I Refuse To Passively Stand By”


	Per national guidance, the police did not name the man but he is being reported widely as being the former Prince. Andrew has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Today is his birthday.


	Thames Valley Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.” 


	Danny Shaw, the BBC's former home affairs correspondent, told BBC News that it was “significant” that Andrew was arrested and not interviewed under caution. He added that it was unlikely that the former Prince would have been aware that police intended to visit his home.


	Earlier this morning, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said “nobody is above the law” when asked about Andrew's behavior, although he declined to say whether the former prince should hand himself in for questioning to UK police.


	Andrew has strenuously denied wrongdoing as he has been pressed over his relationship with Epstein, which has been back in the spotlight following the release of the Epstein Files.


	His association with Epstein became worldwide news following his botched BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with Emily Maitlis, which was a total humiliation. 


	Since the Epstein Files have come out, the situation has severely worsened for Andrew. He lost his Prince title, which was stripped by his older brother, King Charles, and has had to move home. More allegations have followed, much of which appeared to contradict the remarks he made in the Newsnight interview. 


	For weeks, many in the U.S. and UK, including relatives of Virginia Giuffre, the now-deceased woman who Andrew settled with in 2022, have called on him to give testimony in the States.


	Meanwhile, UK lawmakers yesterday said they may investigate Andrew for for his conduct while working as a trade envoy for the UK.


	Andrew's arrest is totally unprecedented and he is the first modern royal to be arrested. The rest of his family are barely speaking with him. King Charles III recently stripped him of his titles and earlier this month Prince William, the heir to the throne, said he and wife Kate Middleton were “deeply concerned” by the latest Epstein revelations.


	The Epstein Files scandal has drawn in a host of politicians, tech leaders and entertainment figures, among them Casey Wasserman, Barry Josephson and Brett Ratner. 


	Andrew is so far the only person to have been arrested since the latest tranche of Epstein Files were released.

	The announcement builds on Imax and Apple's successful collaboration on Apple Films' F1: The Movie. A filmed for Imax release shot with Imax-certified digital cameras, it was the top grossing Imax Hollywood release of 2025 at $97.6 million worldwide. Imax re-released it on 50 screens January 30 after an Oscar Best Picture nomination. The Apple Studios film is directed and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Joseph Kosinski, seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, and Chad Oman.


	Distributed by Warner Bros., it has a global box office take of $654 million, an all-time record for Pitt and for the sports movie category. 


	 “F1 is a rapidly growing force in sports and culture in the US, and by bringing F1 on Apple TV live to Imax theaters nationwide, we're delivering the energy and excitement to even more screens in a truly immersive way,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple's VP of Music, Sports, and Beats. “We're excited to collaborate with Imax to expand access to F1 on Apple TV and give fans across the U.S. a powerful new way to experience the speed and spectacle that the sport delivers.” 

	











F1: The Movie “proved beyond a doubt that the speed, precision, and artistry of Formula 1 translate beautifully to the Imax Experience, and we are very excited to further our collaboration with Apple and offer fans more of what resonated so deeply with that film by presenting live F1 races to them in Imax,” said Imax Chief Content Officer Jonathan Fischer. “We look forward to working with Apple to amplify its live coverage of Formula 1 and give fans in the U.S. an all-new way to experience this fast-growing sport.”

			By Jesse Whittock, Max Goldbart, Stewart Clarke 


Welcome to the Deadline Dozen, the twelve titles debuting at the London TV Screenings next week that we've selected for breakout potential. A record 43 distribution businesses are showcasing their latest hot shows, so this is by no means a comprehensive list, but a curated take on what's coming to market. Genres span drama, comedy, entertainment formats and documentaries, and the companies selling them include Screenings founders, European sellers, U.S. studios and more. Read on for the Dozen.


Anna Pigeon (Cineflix Rights)


	Nevada Barr's ‘Anna Pigeon' novels are coming to the screen and also the London TV Screenings, with Cineflix Rights across sales. Chicago PD star Tracy Spiridakos takes the titular title role, playing the former city slicker who became a park ranger after a devastating loss changes the trajectory of her life. As Anna tries to outrun her demons, her focus turns to solving crimes that have taken place within national park grounds. The series is a Bell Media (Canada) co-commission with Versant's USA Network, the first time these two have partnered in this way. Spiridakos is joined by Paulina Alexis (Reservation Dogs) as a park ranger and Ronnie Rowe (Star Trek: Discovery) as an FBI agent. Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) plays Anna's older sister while Kim Coates (Sons of Anarchy) shows up as a wealthy landowner.

The Cage (Fremantle)


			Watch on Deadline		







	The latest series from The Responder creator Tony Schumacher is this BBC six-parter starring the Olivier-winning Sheridan Smith and Michael Socha. The pair star as casino workers who both discover the other is quietly running amateur heists where they work. They are forced into an uneasy partnership, as the local gangster they're unwittingly stealing from and the police close in. Gambling on a final heist becomes their last chance of escape. Shot in Liverpool and Manchester, the show comes from Element Pictures, Fremantle's Irish production house that has been on a tear in recent years with Poor Things, Pillion, Normal People, Conversations With Friends and Dublin Murders. With Socha, who teamed with Element and Shane Meadows on previous series The Gallows Pole, and prolific screen and theater actress Smith providing the tension, this is sure to attract curious buyers.

	











Girl Climber (Dogwoof)


	If Netflix's Skyscraper Live taught us anything, it's that TV audiences are hungry for the high-octane stress watch of a human being scale a large structure with no safety net. Execs will know this, so Dogwoof's Girl Climber could be among the timelier docs hitting London next week. The Skyscraper Live connection goes deeper, as the doc's cinematography comes from Alex Honnold, the man who scaled Taipei 101 live on Netflix. Girl Climber follows elite mountaineer Emily Harrington, who sets out to conquer Yosemite's El Capitan mountain in under 24 hours. It's basically a terrifying, vertigo-inducing nightmare for many, but for the five-time U.S. national champ, it's the ultimate test and proves gender means nothing in a sport that has been dominated by men.


Dustfall (Federation Studios) 


	Tropic Noir is the new Scandi Noir. Dustfall, an ABC Australia drama that has more than a shade of Top of the Lake, comes to London with plenty of the ingredients of a top-selling drama. For starters, in lead Anna Torv, of Newsreader fame, Dustfall has an Australian actor at the top of her game. She plays Tig Pollard, a detective working a harrowing case after an 18-year-old is found dead in a cane field. Torv is joined by Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly, Deeply), Zoe Phillips (Eden) and Bert LaBonté (Colin From Accounts), quality actors from both the UK and Australia that lend Dustfall some serious heft. With a BBC deal having already been struck, Federation will be hoping this series based on the Vikki Petraitis novel can continue to bolster the French major's standing in the English-speaking content game. By the end of next week, Tropic Noir could be here to stay.


Blue Planet III (BBC Studios)


	The third instalment of the seminal Blue Planet series comes a full quarter-century after the first, and will fully utilize all the developments in camera technology and scientific discovery to reveal new wonders of the oceans. Over six episodes, the BBC and BBC America co-production will focus on the tropical seas, the seasonal seas, polar seas, high seas and deep seas, with the final ep focusing on the future of exploration and protecting the Earth's waters. Intriguingly, it's not yet been confirmed if David Attenborough will return to narrate. At nearly 100 years-old, it shouldn't be surprising if he does not, but given his seemingly inextinguishable spirit for all things natural history, it would be a big talking point in the UK capital as the show launches. Whether the answer to that question impacts buyer appetite is to be seen, though we'd bet not. We'll update if we hear anything from the Blue Planet III screenings next week at 180 Studios on the Strand.


Army of Shadows (Studiocanal)


	The UK's Channel 4 and France's Canal+ have teamed up for the latest drama from Top Boy, The Day of the Jackal and MobLand showrunner Ronan Bennett, and it's one that is bound to attract attention in London. Inspired by Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 film and Joseph Kessel's seminal book, written during the resistance in Nazi-occupied France during WWII, it is set in a near-future Britain sliding into authoritarian rule. Against that backdrop, an ex-soldier, a novelist and a journalist become unlikely leaders of an underground resistance network. The Melville family and the Kessel estate, which is controlled by the Irish Red Cross, have both given the co-production their blessing. Studiocanal is producing and distributing, having developed it with STV Studios-owned Two Cities Television.

	











The Neighbourhood (ITV Studios)


	Taylor Swift's bestie Graham Norton is a man at the top of his game and so there couldn't be a better time for ITV Studios to be shopping his new street-sized reality gameshow. Norton, who hosts a popular UK chatshow, is a guest judge on RuPaul's Drag Race UK and is having his book adapted for TV by FilmNation, will oversee proceedings as real-life households from all walks of life move next to each other and find themselves competing in fierce challenges. Those challenges will change the dynamics behind closed doors and, to win, they'll need to defeat their neighbors, while still staying popular on the street. It's been a while since a weighty constructed-reality show has dominated proceedings and ITV will be hoping it has landed on the next big thing. Think of this as the ultimate fantasy for the nosy neighbor brigade.


The Faithful (Fox Entertainment Global)


	If you're looking for a book adaptation, The Faithful leans into some of the oldest IP in existence. The event series is billed as a faithful dramatization of the Book of Genesis, told through the eyes of the women whose descendants would shape the future of faith as we know it. The episodes of the drama are told through the eyes of five women from The Old Testament: Sarah and her servant Hagar, Sarah's great-niece Rebekah, and Rebekah's nieces, sisters Leah and Rachel. Minnie Driver (Good Will Hunting) plays Sarah in the first instalment and Jeffery Donovan (Fargo) is Abraham. Danny Cannon (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation) is directing and executive producing the premiere. Carol Mendelsohn (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation) is an exec producer. The show will play on the Fox network in the U.S.


Maya (All3Media International)


	At any given time, everyone wants to know what Daisy Haggard and Bella Ramsey are doing next, so the fact they are combining makes Two Brothers Pictures' Maya one of the buzziest shows on offer next week. Haggard, who was behind the critically acclaimed Back to Life, created, and is starring in, the propulsive psychological thriller, which scaled heights when it landed The Last of Us breakout Ramsey as co-lead. Haggard plays Anna, a fiercely devoted single mother forced into witness protection with her headstrong teenage daughter Maya (Ramsey). Leaving behind Anna's parents, played by UK thesps Harriet Walter and Tom Courtenay, the two must assume new identities as they disappear into a remote rural town in Scotland. Dark thrillers are selling like hot cakes at the moment. Haggard and Ramsey will make this one worth watching.


Beyond The Silk Road (Blue Ant Rights)


	HBO's The Wire was seminal and set a new bar for TV drama. That's one reason for the buzz around Beyond The Silk Road, a one-off doc that reunites two of its main stars, Dominic West and Clarke Peters. The duo were hard-bitten cops in David Simon's classic series, but it turns out that while making The Wire, they bonded over a shared love of horsemanship and unwound by riding out into the Maryland wilderness. Here, they saddle up for a trip to Kyrgyzstan, covering some of the titular Silk Road, the historic network of trade routes within which Kyrgyzstan was an important crossroads. They are accompanied by expert and guide Alexandra Tolstoy as they travel on horseback, living in yurts, and taking part in age-old rituals and sports.

	











The Hunt (Seven.One.Studios)


The Hunt is on. Germany's Redseven Entertainment has masterminded this extremely high-stakes survival series in which predators are chasing prey. Having already had a civilian version commissioned by the UK's Channel 4 and a celebrity one for Germany's Joyn, The Hunt comes to London seeking its next victim. It takes place deep in a vast unforgiving forest, as 10 contestants are dropped into the ultimate real-world game of hide and seek – where losing means walking away with nothing and winning could mean pocketing up to £100,000 ($135,000). The Prey hold the cash, desperately trying to protect their winnings while completing challenges to win more money. The Predators must hunt them down and steal their money. If they succeed their roles are reversed and the entire game flips. 


Wallander (Banijay Rights)


	Wallander is back. Swedish novelist Henning Mankell's detective stories have previously been adapted for TV with much success as Kenneth Branagh embodied Kurt Wallander. The new Swedish-language take comes from Jarowskij/Yellow Bird, TV4 and Banijay Rights, with the latter across distribution. Gustaf Skarsgård (Oppenheimer, Vikings) takes the title role across the three 90-minute specials that make up Season 1. The new adaptation promises to go deeper than ever before, taking the audience under the skin of this iconic character. We find Kurt Wallander's life unravelling as the reimagined show kicks off. Newly separated after two decades of marriage and estranged from his daughter, he's on the edge, drinking too much and carrying the weight of every unsolved case.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Brendan Carr denies putting FCC pressure on Colbert—but is investigating The View","https://www.avclub.com/brendan-carr-stephen-colbert-fcc-talarico-the-view","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:22:22 GMT","

As we've reported pretty extensively lately, there's been a lot of back-and-forth going on this week over Stephen Colbert's interview with Texas Rep. James Talarico—and, specifically, who told who what about whether running said interview with the prospective Senate hopeful would run afoul of the FCC's famed equal-time rules for political candidates. Now the FCC itself has weighed in on the conversation, producing a truly dark specter to haunt the ailing body of a weakened democracy: The sight of FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr trying to do schtick.

“I think yesterday was a perfect encapsulation of why the American people have more trust in gas station sushi than they do in the national news media,” Carr feverishly Dennis Miller-ed during an FCC meeting on Wednesday, per The Guardian—suggesting the news media should be ashamed for believing Colbert's “lies” about the interview. Said accusations stemming, as far as we can tell, from Colbert (and Talarico, who's gotten a pretty major media bump off of all this) refusing to pay lip service to Carr's policy of running the government's TV regulation by a national expression of the “I'm not touching you, I'm not actually touching you!” rule so favored by childhood's most irritating siblings. After all, Carr never publicly told CBS not to air an interview with the Democratic up-and-comer: He just made very loud noises about how his FCC wouldn't be adhering to decades of precedent about talk show interviews being treated as exempt from the equal-time rule anymore, and (quite successfully, it appears) waited for the network to comply in advance and regulate itself.

This “I never technically regulated you” approach might offer Carr some measure of legal cover, but it's offered no such protection from Colbert, who has blasted both the FCC and his network over the “legal guidance” they've been so kindly offering him of late. Which, again, has led to the woeful image of Carr trying to throw shade at a guy who cut his national comedy teeth eviscerating hypocrites for a living, tepidly firing back (per Reuters) that Colbert has “what he probably views as a long and distinguished career in the limelight, sees that that limelight is fading, is coming to an end. That's got to be a difficult time for him… That doesn't change the facts of what happened here.” 

Speaking of facts: After all that, Carr then went on to state that he was pursuing an “enforcement action” against ABC's The View for having Talarico on two weeks ago, all but confirming that he would have done the same thing to CBS had they aired the interview. Ignoring the fact that equal-time complaints are traditionally supposed to come from the rival candidates in a campaign, and not just bubbled up by the FCC itself, the move ably demonstrates the true point of so much of Carr's policy in recent years: To produce a chilling effect so that networks don't even bother running the risk of getting dinged, allowing Carr to claim, with a straight smirk, that he's not the one censoring anybody at all.

In what simply has to be the best Nazgul news to hit the public since the dread black riders first rode forth from their dark citadel of Minas Morgul, a Czechoslovakian wolfdog of that name managed to break into the Olympics earlier today, appearing on a ski track during a qualification event for women's cross-country skiing. And, at the risk of editorializing, we here at The A.V. Club would like to go on the record and suggest that this dog should now be given an Olympic medal—possibly taken from one of his faster but less adorable competitors, if need be.

We're not saying Nazgul—who apparently lives at a nearby bed and breakfast, and is owned by people “related to an event official,” per NPR—should be given a gold medal, necessarily. But certainly a bronze; he did, after all, complete the event, with Omega, the company whose cameras do finish-line imaging for the Games, releasing a picture of Nazgul crossing the threshhold with absolutely majestic form. Also, listen to this description of the “stubborn but sweet” Olympian from his owners, whose identities are being kept anonymous so as not to have the entire laser-like focus of Dog Internet beamed at their faces: “He was crying this morning more than normal because he was seeing us leaving—and I think he just wanted to follow us. He always looks for people.” He always looks for people, folks! Give the dog silver, at least. (We just looked it up, licking bronze might not be good for dogs.)

NPR, out of what we can only describe as an excess of journalistic due diligence, also quoted some of the human beings who were skiing when Nazgul broke onto the track, specifically 21-year-old Croatian skier Tena Hadzic. “I was like, ‘Am I hallucinating? I don't know what I should do, because maybe he could attack me, bite me,” Hadzic said. She also noted that the pooch's sudden appearance did cost her “some seconds,” adding, “It's not that big deal, because I'm not fighting for medals or anything big. But if that happened in the finals, it could really cost someone the medals, or a really good result.” Which would be a shame that, in our humble opinions, could only be alleviated by giving Nazgul even more medals, as a treat.

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Crime 101.

Crime 101 has all the necessary components of a Heat clone. Born in the Michael Mann mold, writer-director Bart Layton's sprawling Los Angeles crime drama draws parallels between cops and robbers in a setting defined by extremes. Crime 101‘s crosstown trek shows a feckless ruling class that keeps amassing power, while middle-class have-nots struggle to make ends meet within and without the confines of the law. In this world free of principles, a cop finds hope in a crook with a code. 

Layton is hardly the first filmmaker attracted to the steady propulsion of Mann's beat. In 2018, writer-director Christian Gudegast found similar gold in his grimy L.A. thriller Den Of Thieves, a version of Mann's L.A. takedown that cranks up the machismo in its depiction of a lawless Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the jarhead bank robbers they infiltrate. Yet for all the superficial pleasures these movies find in Heat‘s icy cool action, they stumble just before the credits roll. While Heat ends on a moment of human connection found in violence and the unsettling catharsis it contains, its offspring—like Crime 101—want audiences to go home happy, undercutting the complexity in service of a smile.

Thanks to its weekly timeslot on TNT and Christopher Nolan's cape-based take, The Dark Knight, Heat has grown in esteem since its 1995 debut. Though a sleeper hit at the time, best known for the long-awaited screen meeting of The Godfather Part II stars Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Mann's three-hour crime saga has become the thinking person's '90s action movie. Well aware of Heat‘s long tail to profitability, Mann-inspired action is one of the few sequel-free avenues that Hollywood continues to explore. No wonder then, in his pursuit of thoughtful action (which includes a Mann film of his own), Chris Hemsworth brings the steely precision of his Blackhat character to Crime 101‘s tight-lipped, well-dressed, and obsessive-compulsive main character, James. Like De Niro's Neil McCauley, James prefers caution to chaos, carefully planning his crimes so there's little room for error. When a well-planned stickup goes sideways, he becomes rattled by his lack of control. The Vincent Hanna (Pacino) to Hemsworth's James McCauley is Mark Ruffalo, playing Detective Lou Lubesnick. Together they form the yin and yang of the film's L.A., two sides hoping to find peace on the 101 while lamenting a distinct lack of honor in their respective fields.

Crime 101 turns Heat‘s characters into archetypes so similar that lines from one film could describe characters in the other. In Heat‘s famed diner scene, Hanna describes his life as “a disaster zone […] I got a wife, we're passing each other on the down-slope of a marriage…because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.” McCauley's response could describe James' philosophy: “Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.” The movie tracks their personal relationships as they attempt to build a life inside lifestyles that don't allow for one. Just like the guy in Heat whose best pickup line is describing “a book about metals,” James attempts to date the first woman who talks to him, Maya (Monica Barbaro). Taking the spot of Ashley Judd is Crime 101‘s Sharon (Halle Berry), an insurance adjuster caught between both sides of the law. Other character stand-ins emerge throughout the plot, such as Nick Nolte as fence Money, who operates in the mold of Heat‘s fence Nate (Jon Voight), and Barry Keoghan, who menaces the picture as the unpredictable Waingro (Kevin Gage) figure. Keoghan even gets a suitably weird name: Ormon.

In moving Crime 101 from San Diego, the location of Don Winslow's original novella, to Heat‘s L.A, Layton's film begins to draw unfavorable comparisons. Rather than watching economic classes clash in a series of short stories about ex-cons trying to go straight—stories that give Heat its depth—this conflict now occurs on the city's great equalizer: crosstown traffic. Layton uses shorthand for the Heat‘s deeper themes without having to show the people living through those realities. It flattens the experience of L.A. crime, making it exclusive to the characters in the film. Heat‘s mastery is in its sprawl, not its concision, creating a film that echoes the city it moves through.

But the ending is really where these Heat clones falter. At the end of Heat, Neal McCauley breaks his rule to “walk out in 30 seconds” flat, so that he can exact revenge on Waingro for botching the opening heist. This allows Hanna to catch up to his perp, eventually killing him in a runway shootout. As McCauley dies, Hanna holds his hand. It's a tragedy: Two men caught in careers that will be the end of them, with the survivor recognizing that this criminal is the only one who truly understands him.

Neither Den Of Thieves nor Crime 101 shoots for such an operatic conclusion. In both cases, it's not the second lead, but the wild-card villain who is vanquished, allowing the heroes and antiheroes to fight another day. In Den, Big Nick (Gerard Butler) kills heist honcho Merriman (Pablo Schreiber), allowing Donnie (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) to make an exit that sets up a sequel. Similarly, Crime 101 concludes with a Mexican standoff that sees James killing Ormon to save Lou. Lou returns the favor by allowing James, the perp he's been chasing the whole movie, to go free, choosing to lay the blame on Ormon, a suspect who won't screw up his boss' all-important clearance rates. All's well that ends well.

Like Den Of Thieves, Crime 101 leaves its characters in a better position than when they started. James and Lou have new lives to pursue, and plenty of money with which to do it. The adventure has made them better people, ones who aren't so rigid in their rules—a particularly bizarre conclusion for Lou, a principled cop who once believed that getting the right guy was more important than hitting the right numbers. Crime 101‘s ending is a copout, implying that the L.A. way is to not sweat the small stuff, like a cop planting evidence or laying a crime on the wrong man. Everyone gets their crowdpleasing moment. Crime 101 is Hollywood, but Heat is pure L.A., impossible to navigate without getting your hands dirty.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Frederick Wiseman understood the subtle architecture of humanity","https://www.avclub.com/frederick-wiseman-documentaries-systems-humanity","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 03:09:19 GMT","

We meet many people in Frederick Wiseman's films. The crass American diner sticking his face into a plate of haute cuisine and taking a big whiff in Menus-Plaisirs, Les Troisgros. The migrant worker telling a harrowing story about her daughter's journey on foot to America in In Jackson Heights. The Black security guard slowly losing his patience with the racist ranting of an elderly white man in Welfare. The former schoolteacher, naked and shivering, shoved into a bare cell in Titicut Follies. And yet, none of Wiseman's documentaries are really about these individuals.

The Thin Blue Line director and fellow documentary legend Errol Morris used an entomological metaphor to describe Wiseman's work, writing in 2011 that he “has poked his camera into some truly nasty termite pile[s] and watche[d] with bemused satisfaction as the termites scurry around carrying odd parcels and such.” Where many documentarians would zoom in to focus on one particularly industrious (or lazy) insect, Wiseman could see the whole colony. 

His films are about people in general, their follies and worries and the things they do to get through the day. He loved to film closeups of faces, cutting between the individuals in a crowd as they reacted to a speech or a performance or a long-winded lecture from a teacher or a supervisor or a judge. But why, his films ask, do they carry these specific burdens, and why do they cope with them in the ways that they do? That's where the systems come in. 

It was not some sick fetish for bureaucracy that drove Wiseman's interest in the workings of institutions both seemingly frivolous (he documented the rarified worlds of both modeling and ballet, although he always found meaning in them in the end) and unbearably heavy (1989's Near Death is particularly sobering). Rather, he wanted to understand how the systems we live in shape human behavior, influencing the way we think and feel about the world. Heartbreaking moments are interspersed with silly ones—Wiseman loved a singing telegram—forming complete portraits of humanity in miniature.

Wiseman's 1975 masterpiece Welfare is a prime example. Early in this sprawling (yet relatively compact, compared to his later work) documentary, the employees at the New York City welfare office profiled in the film seem callous and unfeeling, denying desperate people emergency assistance on minor technicalities. But as Welfare wears on and the sheer scale of the poverty on display—not to mention the brokenness of the system supposed to address it—becomes apparent, it also becomes clear that the office workers are not sadists who revel in the suffering of others. They simply have no incentive to alleviate it. 

Although it's subtle, the editing in that film reveals Wiseman's personal feelings about the welfare system. In his later years, the filmmaker dismissed the more obvious commentary found in his early work as “heavy-handed.” But although he doubled down on his strict verité style over the subsequent decades—Frederick Wiseman documentaries have no interviews, no archival footage, and no narration—the very act of choosing what to include, what to condense, and what to leave out of his documentaries was itself an elegant form a storytelling. He was a master of the wraparound structure, and even when his subjects are tedious, his films are fascinating.

Famously uncompromising and independent, Wiseman refused to alter either the reality of the situations he was filming—in 2005, he admitted to Werner Herzog that he might illuminate a room if it was too dark, but that was about it—or the resulting work. His debut Titicut Follies was banned in Massachusetts from 1967 to 1991, and one of his films, 2004's The Garden, was shelved due to copyright issues. (Madison Square Garden sued; he countersued; the film remains unreleased.) For decades, the only way to see one of Frederick Wiseman's movies outside of its initial run was to write a letter to the director's own Zipporah Films, which would decide whether it would lend out one of the 16mm prints in its possession for an officially sanctioned screening. In 2007, he began selling individual titles on DVD through the Zipporah Films website. In 2018, Zipporah made a deal to make Wiseman's films accessible through the library-based streaming service Kanopy, but it took until 2023 to digitize all 45 of them.

Why was a filmmaker who was equally interested in the highest and lowest echelons of society so resistant for so long to making his work more widely accessible? The answer may lie in the work. Watch a couple of Frederick Wiseman documentaries, and it becomes obvious that no one understood the ways that individual people work within systems, and how those systems flatten and dehumanize them in turn, better than he did. Perhaps he was afraid of what might happen, to him and to his work, if he entered more deeply into his nearest system: the film industry. After all, he was only one man.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Catwoman wasn't in on the joke, leaving Halle Berry in the lurch","https://www.avclub.com/women-of-action-catwoman-halle-berry","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 14:24:38 GMT","

With Women Of Action, Caroline Siede digs into the history of women-driven action movies to explore what these stories say about gender and how depictions of female action heroes have evolved over time.

One of my all-time favorite Saturday Night Live sketches comes from Scarlett Johansson's 2015 hosting gig, when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was at its peak but had yet to produce a female-led film. “Does Marvel not know how to make a girl superhero movie?” a movie-trailer voiceover intones before cutting to an imaginary Black Widow movie in the vein of a mid-2000s rom-com—complete with Black Widow getting an internship at a fashion magazine and Thor serving as her gay best friend. It's a hilarious send-up of Hollywood's complete panic around the idea of women-led superhero movies. But it's also an almost verbatim recreation of a superhero movie that actually did come out in the mid-aughts: Halle Berry's Catwoman. 



It's a cosmetics company, rather than a fashion magazine, where “fun-deficient” artist Patience Phillips (Berry) works. But beyond that, many of the details are the same as the sketch. The sassy besties endlessly invested in her romantic life? Check. The improbably giant big-city apartment? Check. The quirky klutziness? Check. The meet-cute with a hot guy who winds up on the opposite side of the law? Check and check. All the fake Black Widow trailer was missing was a sexy one-on-one basketball game and a slashed-up leather dominatrix outfit—two of the most-mocked details in an incredibly mocked movie.

But is there any possibility the creators behind Catwoman made a movie this ridiculous without realizing what they were doing? Is this a case of a female-led superhero movie truly not realizing how bad (and borderline offensive) it is? Or is this a case of a movie aiming for camp and missing the mark by a cat's whisker?

It's a question that presumably haunts Berry, who—to her credit—showed up to accept her Razzie Award for Worst Actress holding the Academy Award for Best Actress she'd won three years earlier. Catwoman was supposed to be the movie that catapulted Berry into a new stratosphere as a blockbuster actress. Instead, it largely derailed her career into the world of mid-budget thrillers. As she put it in her genuinely hilarious Razzie speech, “First of all, I want to thank Warner Bros. Thank you for putting me in a piece of shit, godawful movie. You know, it was just what my career needed. I was at the top and then Catwoman just plummeted me to the bottom. Love it! It's hard being on top, it's much better being on the bottom.” 

﻿

Indeed, when Berry commits to a bit she really commits to it. Throughout Catwoman she deliriously rubs catnip on her face and scarfs down a can of tuna with her fingers. As Berry explained in Entertainment Weekly‘s oral history of the film, “They gave me a cat early on because I didn't have one. His name was Playdough. I watched, studied, and learned how cats think. I didn't have the responsibility of children and family; I was just a woman alone with a lot of idle time to focus on this. I was full-on cat, all the time. I'd crawl around my house, trying to jump on my counters, thinking, If I were a cat, how would I get up there? I was in it 24/7.”

And while it's hard to say her performance is good, exactly, that level of commitment is probably better than the alternative where she just sleepwalked her way through the film. A lot of movies are bad, but few are as memorably bad as Catwoman, which also gives us Sharon Stone vamping it up as a villainous ex-model trying to sell dangerous face cream, and a scene where Patience searches “cats. women” to try to figure out what's going on with her new feline abilities. (She eventually stumbles onto a helpful history site with a tab for “diabolical cats.”) It's impossible to put this on with a group of friends and not have fun laughing at it. That alone is its own kind of cinematic achievement.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have been an intentional one. Catwoman is a story that unsurprisingly starts in development hell. The original idea, back in 1993, was for Tim Burton to direct Michelle Pfeiffer in a spin-off inspired by her phenomenal work in Batman Returns. When that fell apart, Warner Bros. tried to court Ashley Judd and Nicole Kidman for the role, but then shifted focus towards a lower-budget, Blade-inspired origin story that would be gritty and feminist. 

As the superhero genre started to explode in the early 2000s, however, Warner Bros. shifted back to the idea of a big studio movie—one that would have no explicit ties to Batman. French effects supervisor Pitof was brought onboard to direct, Berry was hired for the lead role while filming Die Another Day, and one more set of writers was brought on to rework the script. Scribes John Brancato and Michael Ferris intentionally leaned into a more comedic take on the duality between mild-mannered Patience and her feral alter ego, but studio execs soon began ordering changes and cuts, resulting in what Brancato calls “an oddly cobbled-together version of the script.”

In fact, Brancato and Ferris were hired and fired twice, after a darker rewrite from Men In Black‘s Ed Solomon was trashed just weeks before production began. Pitof had to scrap all his pre-production prep and fire his production designer to appease the studio. “My leverage was little,” Pitof told EW. “I was part of every discussion, but there were 20 people in the room. They'd listen, but I didn't have what I did in France: final cut.” The film was rewritten constantly during production and reshoots were still taking place up until a month before it hit theaters, all adding up to what Brancato calls “a strange, out-of-control machine.”

Still, as with so many big Hollywood projects, it's hard to say how much everyone involved is idealizing a project that was maybe never going to work, even without studio interference. While Brancato claims their original script delivered a more satirical takedown of the beauty industry, as Berry put it, “I always thought the idea of Catwoman saving women from a face cream felt a bit soft. All the other superheroes save the world; they don't just save women from cracked faces.”

Indeed, as silly as it sounds, it's impossible to overstate how unprecedented Catwoman was as a project. While Berry had already played Storm in the first two X-Men movies and while female-led action blockbusters like Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider and Milla Jovovich's Resident Evil were having a moment in the early 2000s, the list of mainstream American superhero movies starring women basically boiled down to one: 1984's Supergirl, the poorly received spin-off of the Christopher Reeve Superman universe. And though Eartha Kitt had famously played Catwoman in the 1960s, Catwoman would remain the first and only superhero movie led by a Black woman until Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in 2022. 

Rather than grapple with or even acknowledge that glass-ceiling-shattering reality, however, Warner Bros. took the “soft” path. Make Catwoman hot to appeal to the guys. Put her in a rom-com to appeal to the girls. Set the whole thing in the beauty industry because that's where female protagonists belong. Build the movie around the twist that it's actually an evil woman running the corrupt cosmetics company rather than a man, which is somehow both progressive and regressive at the same time. End the whole thing with a vampy “cat fight.”

The 2000s were a frictionless, smooth-brained time for feminism and Catwoman very much fits that ethos. In some ways, that's the best thing about it—there's a madness to Catwoman that you just don't get from superhero movies today, which tend to be bad in boring, formulaic ways rather than exhilaratingly off-putting ones. 

At its best, Catwoman has a sense of intense comic-book styling that recalls the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies or the better moments of Joel Schumacher's Batman films. (There's an incredible scene where Berry saunters up to a bar to order a “White Russian. No ice. Hold the vodka. Hold the Kahlúa.”) But, at some point, the whole thing just collapses under the weight of its terrible CGI and hackneyed plotting. A movie that's truly in on the joke would have been able to sustain its ridiculousness to the end, as Batman & Robin does. But Catwoman makes the fatal flaw of trying to become at least a little bit serious about what it means to “die and be reborn” and “experience a freedom other women will never know” as a catwoman. This is its ultimate undoing. 

While Catwoman has found its following as a cult classic over the past 22 years, its status as an infamous flop still outweighs any ironic reclamation, particularly for Berry. “I hated that it got all put on me, and I hate that, to this day, it's my failure,” she told EW in 2024. “I felt like it was Halle Berry's failure, but I didn't make it alone.” Thankfully, in the years since Catwoman‘s release, she's proven to be an effective action heroine elsewhere—both in smaller thrillers like Kidnap and in bigger projects like John Wick: Chapter 3—Parabellum. 

Catwoman herself has recovered too, first in the hands of Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises and then Zoë Kravitz in The Batman. However, no one has yet been bold enough to return to the idea of a solo Catwoman flick. Maybe that's the most telling lesson Catwoman has to teach us: When Batman or Superman or The Fantastic Four star in a movie that stinks, Hollywood just recasts the roles and makes another one. But when women superheroes fail, they don't usually get a second chance. Once Jennifer Garner's Elektra bombed the year after Catwoman, Hollywood put a kibosh on female-led superhero movies for over a decade, until Wonder Woman took a swing 12 years later.  

So far, at least, James Gunn's rebooted DC Universe doesn't seem to have any plans to change that fate for its feline heroine. Catwoman may be one of the most iconic female characters in the entire comic book canon—and her story feels ripe for a lower-budget, thematically rich retelling—but unlike her male counterparts, she doesn't get nine onscreen lives.

Next time: Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch turns 15.

Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka may look like a couple goals today. But even their long-standing marriage has had its share of turbulence, including a period that forced Bateman to confront habits that were quietly straining their relationship.

In a new interview, Bateman is getting candid and opening up like never before! The star is revisiting a chapter of his life that forced him to slow down and look inward. He shared that getting sober was less about career ambition and more about easing the quiet strain his drinking had placed on his relationship with Amanda Anka.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Wednesday, the “Horrible Bosses” star reflected on how his years of partying brought, as Anka described, a constant “drip, drip, drip” of unpredictability into their home.

Anka, also 57, eventually asked him when the “spigot was going to completely turn off.”

Bateman admitted they had “a few negotiations” about his drinking. “[She] didn't demand that I completely absolve, but that was sort of the back-and-forth.

“I was like, ‘Well, I feel like my [sobriety] ETA is six months away, but if I could land this plane now, it would alleviate a lot of the tension, so let's just [expletive] do it,'” the “SmartLess” podcast co-host said. 

Looking back, he said it was not a dramatic breaking point. It was a quiet realization that he was ready to make a change.

Bateman said he has stayed away from alcohol and cocaine, which he once described as “the ‘Scarface' stuff,” since getting sober. He shared that he still smokes marijuana.

Looking back, he feels fortunate he made the decision before things spiraled out of control.

“I've got friends who had bottoms that were pretty chilling, but I was lucky enough to recognize, ‘This is probably as far as I should go if I still want to accomplish the things that I want to get to,'” he told the outlet.

At the time, he was thinking beyond Hollywood success. He was thinking about the life he hoped to build.

“I was conscious the whole time of wanting to get a lot of these boxes checked before I became a father and a guy with a career that I not only wanted but had a feeling I might be able to get if I just got the right job,” he said.

Bateman married Anka in July 2001, the same year he stopped drinking. The couple later welcomed daughters Francesca, now 19, and Maple, now 14, milestones that unfolded in the years that followed his decision to change course.

In a December 2025 interview with Esquire, Bateman reflected on how quickly his life transformed. He said his sobriety, his Malibu wedding, and his breakout role on “Arrested Development” all unfolded within “12 to 24 months.” 

During that same stretch, he also quit smoking.

Looking back, he described the years leading up to that shift as a “confusing and challenging … learning curve,” especially after spending much of his childhood steadily working in Hollywood.

Bateman has long acknowledged that alcohol often fueled other habits in his 20s.

In a 2009 interview with Details, via NBC Miami, he explained, “Booze was what would make me want to stay out all night and do some blow or smoke a joint or whatever, so shutting that off was key. … So that's the moment. Do you want to continue being great at being in your twenties, or do you want to step up and graduate into adulthood?”

As Bateman got closer to 30, he said he began to understand that some habits no longer aligned with the future he envisioned.

He has shared that there were “a handful things” he “couldn't be doing” if he wanted lasting success.

For him, quitting was not a spectacle. It was a conscious, measured choice.

Today, Bateman's career remains strong, and his marriage to Anka is thriving! In hindsight, he does not frame sobriety as a sacrifice, but as the turning point where he chose the life he truly wanted.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Nikki DeLoach Vulnerably Shares Her Powerful New Goal","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/nikki-deloach-faith-lent-2026-intention/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 01:42:59 GMT","

Nikki DeLoach has big plans for the next 40 days. On February 18, 2026, the beloved Hallmark star posted an emotional message for fans in honor of Ash Wednesday, observed by many Christians as the start of Lent, the 40 days before Easter that many use as a period of reflection and fasting. 

Appearing in a powerful selfie video with her screenwriting partner and dear friend, Megan McNulty, DeLoach shared that they'd just been to their “little brown church in the valley,” both with a symbolic cross, written in ash, on their foreheads. The duo shared what they've each decided to focus their “intention” on over the next 40 days, sweetly supporting one another in their goals. 

DeLoach, who's always been open about her faith, said she and McNulty went to church together “to say prayers, not just for ourselves and our families and our friends and our community, but for the world.” 

“Last year, I had this very clear — and it was a really hard — intention,” she continued. “I spent 40 days and nights in prayer, every morning and every night. And the transformation and breakthrough was tremendous.” 

It was so transformational that the “Curious Caterer” star and her bestie decided to publicly share their intentions for Lent this year, in hopes they might “inspire” others, McNulty said. DeLoach added they hoped those listening would “feel like you're not alone in your own intentions.” 

As DeLoach and McNulty began to share their intentions for Lent, McNulty said, “Mine's pretty simple,” noting that the thing she's “giving up” for Lent is trying to fix everything. She explained that she's “giving up fixing one thing any time my head rests (on) the pillow, each night, one thing that I did not fix, I'm gonna leave it there.”

Getting emotional, DeLoach then said that “in all the hard and the suffering that's happening, I want to focus on imagining a more beautiful and true world.” 

As McNulty put her head on DeLoach's shoulder, the actress said, “You know when Jesus and when God asked us to bring Heaven to Earth, right? What does that look like? Do we dare imagine it?” 

“So, each day,” DeLoach continued, “I want to pick a person or a situation and imagine what that situation or what that person's life looks like if Heaven is brought to Earth, and we imagine the truest, most beautiful way forward. So that's what I'm going to be doing.”

Many fans shared gratitude for DeLoach's video, including one who wrote, “That's awesome it speaks to the intention of my own heart. We need to be the light bearers.”

Another commented, “Thank you so much for sharing. I pray that this lent will be a good one for you and I pray that you will find your peace. I think that's my intent this year is to find more peace in my life and joy each day🙏🏻 each day.”

Netflix's new docuseries about “America's Next Top Model” has plenty to say about an alleged culture of exploitation, sexism, and racism lurking behind the scenes of one of reality TV‘s formerly proudest hits. But across three episodes, “Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model” catalogs story after story of young women being body-shamed, manipulated, and pushed to emotional extremes in a way that once again treats their trauma as alarmingly trivial. 

From invasive dental procedures mandated by “Top Model” judges — to troubling late-night encounters with men the girls met while traveling abroad — “Reality Check” presents its limited cast of contestants earnestly, but it tells their side of things only in part. More than 300 people competed on “Top Model” over the course of the show's 24-season run, but just 10 contestants appear in Netflix's new account. Worse, “Reality Check” co-directors Mor Loushy and Daniel Sivan subject the women who do appear to many of the same toxic tricks that got us here in the first place. Structurally, “Reality Check” looks less like a documentary than an unscripted reunion wrapped in prestige true crime packaging.

Nowhere is that imbalance clearer than in the project's repeated return to the reality show's most infamous moment: Banks' on-camera confrontation with contestant Tiffany Richardson during Season 4. The clip (“Be quiet, Tiffany. Be quiet. Never in my life have I yelled at a girl like this!”) has long functioned as “Top Model” shorthand for the show's characteristic cruelty and Banks' volatility. “Reality Check” presents the moment as the product of a pressure-cooker workplace that made Banks feel personally responsible for helping women navigate the industry.

 










But the docuseries does not include Richardson herself, once again making her powerless in a national narrative. The former contestant does not appear to reflect on the moment that has come to define her public image, and instead she responded to the series via Instagram (h/t Vulture). Calling Banks a “bully” and challenging her to speak face-to-face, Richardson's sentiments don't feel like closure, and “Reality Check” never meaningfully grapples with what it means to keep reopening psychological wounds while sidelining the real people who “Top Model” hurt. 

Even as the series continues to villainize Banks, the competing women of “Top Model” rarely get the sustained attention given to the show's more familiar faces: Jay Manuel, Miss J. Alexander, and Nigel Barker. Longtime series fixtures who served as judges, mentors, and on-camera fashion authorities throughout much of the original show's run, all three personalities are listed as consultants on “Reality Check.” Barker and Manuel also donated archival footage, and the series treats the trio gently without making that relationship explicit until the credits.  

Manuel, Alexander, and Barker are given extensive space to contextualize their actions, explain their discomfort with certain challenges, and frame their participation in those scenes as constrained by a business model that was bigger than them… but supposedly, not bigger than Banks. Their agency is rarely challenged in “Reality Check,” but their emotional journeys are still foregrounded over the voices of victims and the contrast is striking. They are allowed to reckon with how they felt about controversial “Top Model” moments — including photoshoots that saw them personally challenging contestants to embrace blackface, glamorize domestic violence, and work through more thoughtless shock value — without being pressed on why they failed to intervene back then. 

 










The show devotes significant time to the three consultants' past hardships as well as their ongoing bond, and that's crystallized in a moving segment about Alexander's harrowing recovery after a devastating stroke in 2022. That moral generosity matters because these creative personalities were not peripheral observers to the “Top Model” world, as they themselves admit in “Reality Check.” They were authority figures whose approval shaped contestants' fates and their failure to interrogate their own motives then and now suggests an enduring lack of self-awareness that undermines this new project.

Manuel, Alexander, and Barker were all laid off by Banks and producer Ken Mok in a high-profile restructuring for “Top Model” in 2012. “Reality Check” frames the trio's participation in this series as incidental to that earlier schism, but their demeanor while recounting some of the events related to that emotional employment saga come across as tone-deaf at best and axe-grinding at worst. 

Notably not credited as a consultant, Banks occupies a more constrained and paradoxical position in “Reality Check.” The docuseries repeatedly depicts the former host declining to answer certain questions from her interviewer: a framing choice that subtly positions her as evasive. Simultaneously, that restraint conveys the sense that Banks knows she's behind enemy lines and could be a victim of bad editing like anyone else. The seasoned supermodel offers some of the most thoughtful analysis in the series, explicitly tying the worst “Top Model” moments to a deeply exploitative industry. But Banks also seems careful to not take responsibility for anything the “Reality Check” research team can't prove. 

 










The result is an ethically muddy exercise that might satisfy the rhythms of subscribers who like reality TV of varying tastes and ethical levels, but it falls sorely short of documentary's basic obligations and intellectual rigor. Netflix's role looms large over all of this, of course. The streaming platform has a well-documented history of recycling real trauma for content, particularly in the unscripted space. “Reality Check” fits neatly into that troubling pattern, effectively suspending the damage of “Top Model” in amber and treating the exploitation at its core like any other piece of familiar IP. 

Even with the aughts back in fashion, the real danger of “Reality Check” isn't that it reignites harm but normalizes doing so with little regard for the consequences. When it comes to explaining how and why the culture at “Top Model” was allowed to get progressively worse for over 15 years, “Reality Check” is noticeably selective. Responsibility is framed as both diffuse and oddly concentrated, with Banks and, to a lesser extent, Mok positioned as primary targets for scrutiny. It's an incomplete narrative that cries out for more thorough investigation, as others involved in crafting the problematic show receive more grace. 

Documentary has long carried an expectation of empirical truth and public service. The format can help society reckon with abuse long after headlines fade, but when projects like “Reality Check” confuse exposure with accountability, they undermine that trust and make it harder to inspire change. Here, Netflix seems to want viewers to feel informed about the history of “Top Model” only to the extent that it benefits their agenda. A clear-eyed portrait of how capitalism and fame corrode good intentions could be valuable, but a glossy retrospective of retired humiliation suggests indifference is back in fashion.

 










“Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model” is now streaming on Netflix.

Thousands of invading American, British, and Canadian soldiers died on D-Day just trying to make it to shore. That grim fact props up Focus Features' new “Pressure” as more of a slow-boiling political thriller than your average World War II movie. And yet, both strategic battlefields derive their excitement from deciding when, where, and how “real” characters should finally pull the trigger and make history.

Directed by Anthony Maras and co-written with David Haig, adapting Haig's 2014 stage play from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (which later appeared on the West End), “Pressure” unfolds over the 72 hours preceding the largest seaborne military invasion ever tried. At its center is General Dwight D. Eisenhower (Brendan Fraser) and Royal Air Force meteorologist James Stagg (Andrew Scott), whose forecast will determine whether the conflict-changing takeover in France has even the smallest chance to succeed.

Here, Fraser brings ferocious authority to Eisenhower, embodying the familiar role with an all-consuming, gruff steadiness that casts the 34th U.S. president as a force as strong as weather. The Oscar winner (“The Whale”) further explores Eisenhower's diplomatic reputation by unearthing a side that's even more emotional and dynamic. Under Maras' grinding escalation of the stakes, “Pressure” promises a feature that follows the real man and the myth he became to produce a cultural swell this consequential.

A military leader holding firm beneath the weight of international conflict, a one-note Eisenhower performance is a real risk that still lingers for Fraser. But the first “Pressure” trailer suggests he's got a good scene partner in Scott. Stagg must treat clouds as a life-or-death key to abstract science, and the footage here toggles between claustrophobic war-room scenes and sweeping shots of churning rain off the coast of Normandy for an uneasy visual balance that mirrors the strong leads brewing tension.

Kerry Condon also appears as Eisenhower's assistant Kay Summersby, while Chris Messina, Damian Lewis, and more round out an ensemble that positions “Pressure” as a prestige acting showcase with big aspirations in the wake of masterpieces from “Das Boot” to “Dunkirk.” Revisiting a heavily contentious chapter of American life comes with stiff competition, but “Pressure” seems set to weather the storm. 

From Focus Features, “Pressure” will be released in theaters on Friday, May 29. Watch the film‘s first trailer below.

Over 50 years after “Death Wish” it's hard to find a new take on revenge movies, but writing and directing siblings Kevin and Matthew McManus have found a delightfully original and emotionally affecting approach in their new thriller “Redux Redux.” The film follows the adventures of Irene (Michaela McManus, the filmmakers' sister), a grief-stricken mother who travels through parallel universes to kill her daughter's murderer over and over again. The problem is that with each act of vengeance Irene finds it harder and harder to get the satisfaction she craves — and realizes she's losing her soul in the process.

 










The McManus brothers' elegantly structured screenplay is a smoothly engineered combination of suspense, tragedy, action, dark humor, and ultimately redemption that veers between wildly disparate tones with carefully calibrated ease. Although it recalls time travel movies like “The Terminator” and “Back to the Future” in its skill at making complicated structural and conceptual conceits accessible and entertaining, its unique style is all its own, and so original that the movie is sometimes difficult to classify.

That goes for the filmmakers themselves, who were surprised to learn during the editing process that their first audience couldn't clearly articulate what genre the movie belonged to. “After we we screened the movie for the first time with a big group of friends, we asked, ‘What genre do you think this is?'” Matthew McManus told IndieWire. “We were really on the fence ourselves. There are some gruesome elements, but it isn't a pure horror film in my mind.”

 










The brothers were surprised to find that the audience didn't think of it as a straight horror flick or a straight science fiction film, even though it's a multiverse movie. “They really latched on to the idea that this is a character-driven revenge drama that happens to have sci-fi and horror elements,” Matthew said. “That was a big surprise to us. But it was a lovely surprise, and it's nice when you learn things about the movie that you didn't realize.” 

Keeping the various timelines straight and clear to the audience was tricky for the filmmakers, who found that they had to be more rigorous with the details than on a typical movie. “On every movie up until this point, Matt and I were always like, ‘Continuity be damned,'” Kevin McManus told IndieWire. “If people are noticing the continuity, that means you've got bigger problems with your story. But here, that's where the joy is, in the Easter eggs where you're seeing a coffee mug change colors or a sign change incrementally. Continuity became much more challenging — and more fun — making sure those things all matched up.”

To a certain degree, the writers were able to simplify their script simply by trusting that the audience would understand the multiverse concept from other films and TV shows. “We started writing almost 10 years ago, and that was before the big multiverse boom,” Kevin said. “There used to be a long monologue at the beginning just explaining what a multiverse even is and how it works, but we were able to strip a lot of that out and just lean into giving the audience the chance to figure it out as they go along.”

 










A lot of the movie's power comes from the performances, particularly Michaela's wrenching work as the rage-filled, devastated heroine. Even before the mechanisms of the plot are clearly understandable, the audience is on board thanks to the depth and economy of expression in Michaela's performance — we understand intuitively what she's going for even before the script has made it explicit. For Matthew, directing the actors comes down to giving them “actionable” directions — and not getting too rigid about how the brothers envisioned the characters as they were writing them.

“It's about giving them pointed directions to get to the results we're looking for,” Matthew said, “and not falling too much in love with our own explanations for what the character has been through.” The directors quickly learned that for extremely emotional scenes, Michaela worked best if she was allowed to build up on the first take, then do it immediately again without cutting camera. That second try was almost always the best, which on one occasion created problems when the perfect acting take coincided with an unfortunate set mishap.

“The first take was pretty good,” Matthew said. “Then the second take was amazing, and the whole crew was leaning in — it was just magic. And at that moment, a security guard at the ranch where we're shooting just walks through the background. This big eye sore of a random stranger! We tried it again, and the third take was good but not the same, so we used visual effects to erase this guy and get the perfect performance.”

 










Throughout the shoot time was the biggest enemy, as the McManus brothers had only 18 days to make an incredibly complex movie. “Every day was a big day and every day had a massive set piece attached to it,” Kevin said. “Not only that, but every day had heavy emotional beats for the actors to grapple with as well. Running up against time was a constant battle, and the only way you fight that is by being really serious about your prep, really serious about your shot list and executing exactly what you need. Because there's just no time to get inspired on set.”

That said, making a movie with their sister made shooting “Redux Redux” a joyous experience for the brothers, who were brought back to their childhoods before Michaela made a name for herself on TV shows like “Law and Order: SVU” and the current “Memory of a Killer.” “I can't help but think back to when I was a little kid making horror movies with my sister,” Matthew said. “I remember back then, her scream was so blood-curdling. On ‘Redux Redux,' she'd be getting dragged through the dirt screaming, and everyone else on the set was horrified. But Kevin and I both had grins on our faces, because it just reminded us of making movies when we were teenagers.”

“Redux Redux” opens in theaters on Friday, February 20.

When cinematographer Linus Sandgren reunited with “Saltburn” director Emerald Fennell for her maximalist take on Emily Brontë's 1847 classic “Wuthering Heights,” he immediately felt liberated by Fennell's passionate, fearless approach to the material. “Normally in a film you always have some sort of realism that you feel bound to,” Sandgren told IndieWire. “But in this case, the realism is Emerald's world — it was very inspiring because it felt like there were no limits to how expressive we could be with this love story. You really could go all the way, having free rein.”

 










Having free rein meant Sandgren was able to help Fennell find a cinematic corollary for the visceral experience she had as a teenager when she first read the book. “ I wanted to make something that felt like the world of a 14-year-old girl reading this book for the first time,” Fennell told IndieWire, “which meant that things are a little more heightened, or a little more anachronistic.”

The key for Fennell, Sandgren, and collaborators like production designer Suzie Davies, was to create a self-contained world with its own internal logic and guiding principles — principles informed not by literal reality but by the emotional states of the characters.

 










“You should be able to pause the movie and understand what the characters are feeling inside that frame,” Fennell said. “Whether it's foreboding, whether it's dread, whether it's lust.” For Sandgren, that often meant taking advantage of — or, for the scenes shot on stages, creating — extreme weather conditions. “In Yorkshire, where the story takes place, you have dramatic weather to work with,” Sandgren said. “It's a great metaphor.” For example, when the filmmakers wanted to convey the humiliation of heroine Cathy's father (Martin Clunes), they relied heavily on rain to give him the appearance of, as Sandgren put it, “a sad dog.”

Because even many exteriors were created on stages, Sandgren and Fennell had extreme control over their palette; the result is some of the most striking color imagery since the glory days of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, whose studio-bound flights of fancy like “Black Narcissus” and “A Matter of Life and Death” were key reference points for Fennell. “When heartbreak occurs, the sky can be blood red,” Fennell said, adding that Thrushcross, the estate Cathy (Margot Robbie) moves to in the middle of the film, exists in a state of everlasting spring. “Except when it's Christmas — then it always snows.”

The desire to give the audience an immersive emotional experience informed each of Sandgren's choices, including what format to shoot on and what aspect ratio to select for the framing. As has come to be Sandgren's usual practice, “Wuthering Heights” was captured on film — primarily 35mm, with some sweeping landscape shots photographed in VistaVision. At one point, Sandgren and Fennell considered shooting the movie on 65mm, but the grain was too fine and the detail too sharp for the textured, romantic look they desired.

 










“Film is an organic format,” Sandgren said. “If you have a digital camera and the camera is still, and there's a wall, then it's actually a still image, and it's not moving. But film moves, and that automatically helps with the suspension of disbelief. It also really helps with the richness of the colors and the skin tones. It's much more emotional.” Although Sandgren and Fennell leaned into the grain for most shots, for wide shots, they used the higher resolution VistaVision so that the viewer's eye could go to small figures in the frame without being distracted by grain that was nearly as large as the actors.

For Fennell, shooting on film added to the tactile quality of the movie, something she tried to embrace on every level. “You want the feeling of hands that make things,” she said, “whether it's Charli XCX's music or the film itself or the skin wall.” Fennell wanted viewers to buy into the reality of her very unreal world, which played into both the decision to shoot on celluloid and the choice of a 1.85:1 aspect ratio as opposed to the 1.33:1 frame she and Sandgren used on “Saltburn,” or a wider anamorphic frame that might have showcased the landscapes.

“It could have been a 1.33 movie, and it could have been a 2.40 movie,” Sandgren said, explaining that he and Fennell had a lot of discussions about the pros and cons of various aspect ratios. Ultimately, he felt 1.85 would be the most enveloping format simply because it's the one most cinemas are currently built for. “Unfortunately, most screens now are built for 1.85, and if you see a 2.40 movie, it has matting just like on your TV. When you go to a cinema, you want to see it as big as possible on the screen, and today 1.85 screens are the larger format.”

 










Fennell noted that the different aspect ratios indicate the different approaches taken to “Saltburn” and “Wuthering Heights.” “‘Saltburn' is a portrait and this is a landscape,” Fennell said, adding that if they had gone wider, it would have been more difficult to compose in the painterly fashion to which she and Sandgren aspired. Sandgren also felt that the 1.85 frame lent itself to the many scenes in which he wanted Cathy to appear isolated. “The movie is often about her being lonely,” Sandgren said. “She's lying on a rock, or sitting alone in a room, and I think you can do those lonesome compositions more powerfully in a taller format than 2.40.”

Ultimately, Sandgren and Fennell agreed that these decisions and others were guided largely by instinct; although they began each day with a shot list, they didn't lock themselves into it or create detailed storyboards that would restrict the actors. “It's a long process where things slowly evolve,” Sandgren said. “Some scenes might be very clearly planned, while others evolve and finalize on the day. You really can't know the shots for an emotional scene until you see the actors and work with them together.”

“We plan really rigorously,” Fennell said, explaining that careful shot-listing then liberates her and Sandgren to explore in the moment. “We have it already, and then you see something more interesting. We're always looking for something intimate and exciting. And you can really only do that on the day.” 

 










The sense of playfulness and experimentation extended to Fennell and Sandgren's influences and reference points, which went beyond other films and even paintings and into more unorthodox areas. “We looked at a lot of disgusting stuff,” Fennell said. “The interior structure of the heart, and its relationship to a tree. That's the real fun… then you get to open all sorts of little doors.”

A Warner Bros. release, “Wuthering Heights” is now in theaters.

Just how immortal are we talking? The last we saw of Cillian Murphy's iconic gangster and “Peaky Blinders” star Tommy Shelby, the mob boss was literally riding off on a white horse (symbolism!) after undergoing a change of heart (and a change of lungs, depending on how you view his false diagnosis of tuberculoma). 

When the beloved BBC series ended after six seasons in 2022, its conclusion offered a bit of a respite for Tommy, while leaving the door wide open for more drama and trauma with the Peaky Blinders gang. Creator Steven Knight was never shy about his plans for more “Peaky,” and the first (of what may be many) films and other followups is now just weeks away from release.

So, what's it about? Well, Tommy is back in Birmingham, and has been hinted, a time jump is very much afoot. We're now smack in the middle of World War II, and life in England is about as hard as it's ever been. While some folks have forgotten Tommy Shelby, plenty of others have not (shout out to the pub dudes who very much get it). That includes his young son Duke (played by franchise newbie Barry Keoghan), who seems to be mixed up in some pretty nasty business (read: treason?). What a time for his dear old dad to reappear.

Tom Harper directed the film, which Knight himself wrote. In 2025, as he was working on the feature, Knight shared, “The stuff that I'm watching — the rushes, the assemblies — no one will be disappointed. It is quite an incredible thing. It's a very fitting way to end this part of the ‘Peaky' story.”

The film also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, Sophie Rundle, Ned Dennehy, Packy Lee, Ian Peck, Jay Lycurgo, and Stephen Graham.

“Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man” will release in select theaters on Friday, March 6, and on Netflix on Friday, March 20. Watch the film's first full trailer below.

Emerald Fennell's new adaptation of Wuthering Heights reimagines Emily Brontë's classic novel as a big-budget bodice ripper. It stars Jacob Elordi as the lascivious, brutish Heathcliff and Margot Robbie as an improbably blonde, manifestly too-old Cathy Earnshaw. Among other attractions, it features public hanging, dollhouse murder, puppy play, and vast quantities of tactile goop as a stand-in for the unspeakable. There are enough overtones of horny menace to pass for “erotic” among a viewing public in the midst of a sex drought. The film is both overlong and overwrought and is neither as brilliant nor as terrible as critics and Letterboxd reviewers make it out to be. It has to be one of the most middling movies to stoke a media super-cycle, which has had the unfortunate effect of overshadowing the best thing it has going for it: a new companion album by Charli XCX.

After dominating culture so thoroughly that she left lasting marks on both color theory and American presidential politics, Wuthering Heights serves as a hard reset and a clever lateral move for the British pop diva in the wake of BRAT. In what is either a fluke of good timing or a 5D command of the narrative, it is now possible to go to your local movie theater and make a double feature of Charli's recent career. The anxieties underlying her metafictional turn in the sorta-documentary The Moment—that the gears of commerce would either crush her as an artist or leave her in the dust—have proven to be unfounded. Here she is once again at the center of pop culture, working at the peak of her abilities to renovate her sound for the largest audience possible. By trading strobe-lit arenas for wild and windy moors, the singer meets the challenge of transplanting her music into a new landscape. Wuthering Heights is both a reinvention and familiar offering from the singer: underlining her adventurousness as a musician and the strengths (and limits) of her songwriting.

After Fennell approached her to write a song for the film, Charli and producer Finn Keane threw themselves into the project, expanding the assignment into a full soundtrack. Like Fennell's film, Wuthering Heights doesn't adapt Brontë's book for its plot but for its vibe. The record is vivid and fragmentary, and it revolves around a clutch of loaded, broadly sketched themes: attraction so powerful it feels like a curse, devotion so total it brings you to your knees, absence so painful it cuts to the bone. The John Cale-featuring “House” sets an appropriately vague and foreboding tone. With a voice as ancient and craggy as the hills, Cale's spoken-word narration poses unanswerable questions about beauty and eternity before death creeps into the picture and Charli joins him in shriek-intoning the line, “I think I'm gonna die in this house.”

Even for a singer who has made a home on top of the thorniest of club beats, the full-bodied cello blasts on “House” represent another magnitude of chaos. Inspired by Cale's stated wish to sound “elegant and brutal” in Todd Haynes' Velvet Underground documentary, Charli and Keane adopted this slogan as the record's guiding mission. The string arrangements are lovely, lending every song a measure of uplift and writhing texture. But the record's best tracks trend brutal, when the physicality of the music barrels down hardest. With its mournful swell and industrial churn, “Funny Mouth” sounds far more like a lost Vulnicura cut than anything on BRAT. Here the strings underline the lyric's unspoken threat and give a spiky subtext to the silky vocals. The beatless “Wall of Sound” is a liebespaar between Charli's cartwheeling melody and a groaning expanse of strings: Struggling against the pull of the arrangement, she finally gives into her desire and allows her voice to get carried up and away with the sound.

Part of the reason that Charli's voice fits so neatly in what ought to be a radically new context is that her hooks always dominate the instrumentals. Despite inevitable comparisons to Rosalía's Lux, Wuthering Heights is first and foremost a pop record in classical drag, rather than any kind of compositional hybrid. This means that the vivid surroundings can be undercut when a song guns for more a conventional payoff. On “Out of Myself” and “My Reminder,” the strings flesh out the familiar elements of fairly standard synth pop; the novelty of their sound can't overcome the flatness of their ideas. By contrast some of the best songs harken back to earlier eras of Charli's discography. “Chains of Love” builds and booms in a way that's scarcely been heard since True Romance. The sudden leap that “Eyes of the World” takes is surprising no matter how many times you brace for it. Charli proved she had a rare chemistry with Sky Ferreira on “Cross You Out,” and the interplay of their soaring voices makes you wish they would lock in for an album of duets.

As a songwriter, Charli's directness, rather than her expressiveness, has long been her greatest gift; although a diva as a performer, as a writer she's still acquiring a taste for the dramatic. “Always Everywhere” works from the simple premise of being constantly reminded of a loved one's face, but it is studded with lapidary-fine detail that elevates it above romantic cliché. “On the water, your face on top of mine/A fever dream of mirrored features, hungry eyes,” she sings over barely perceptible strings. Plenty of songs, though, bank on the latent heaviness of goth imagery to charge up a scene. This is the case on “Dying for You” and “Out of Myself,” which evoke pain, torture, and twisted desire while being too agreeably pop to truly honor the gnarliness of the material.

Pop songs operate on a smaller scale than two-hour movies, and, despite those constraints, the liberties that Charli and Keane take in blending pop hooks and orchestral chaos gives their soundtrack album an impressive vastness. Still, the duo can occasionally repeat the same shortcomings of the film. In context, “Chains of Love” accompanies a sequence similar to the shopping spree from Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. Having accepted Edgar Linton's offer to join hands (and bank accounts), Cathy enjoys the creature comforts of her new life with a heavy heart that still longs for Heathcliff's rough embrace. But Fennell is too fixated on the surface dazzle to undercut the mood with deeper melancholy or conflicted sexuality. Wuthering Heights is a period drama with iPhone face, one that can recognize fraught emotion but can't always inhabit it. Charli is one of the definitive pop artists of our time, but in soundtracking a classic story, she never fully transcends our moment.

A mythical set of live John Coltrane recordings, the Tiberi Tapes, will finally be released this year. Recorded at jazz clubs in New York and Philadelphia between 1961 and 1965 by saxophonist Frank Tiberi, the Tiberi Tapes have long been relegated to a private collection. But as part of a year-long celebration of Coltrane's 100th birthday in September, the set will land on Impulse! as a Record Store Day exclusive on April 18, ahead of a wider release this September.

To celebrate the centennial, Impulse! has also shared a new video for the A Love Supreme opener “Acknowledgement.” Directed by Kamasi Washington and Mitski collaborator AG Rojas, it features a faithful recreation of New Jersey's Van Gelder Studios on the day A Love Supreme was recorded there. Check out the video below.

The “Coltrane 100” programming will also include reissues of classics like Ascension, Africa/Brass and Impressions; a new best-of compilation highlighting his 1957 and 1958 sessions; and a sound installation overseen by hi-fi specialist Devon Turnbull at New York's Cooper Hewitt. A September 23 show at the Hollywood Bowl, “Coltrane 100: Legacy,” will feature orchestral adaptations of Coltrane's work from Wynton Marsalis, saxophonist Lakecia Benjamin, and a 16-piece symphony. This year, the John and Alice Coltrane Home in Dix Hills, New York, and the John Coltrane House in Philadelphia will also open to the public for the first time.

No more fucking models in the back of Uber XLs. No more brooding alone at house parties. No more ditching women in random cities on a whim. No more sending girlfriends to therapy by labeling himself a “walking erection” or basking in his hedonism with rhetorical questions like, “I like to run the streets 'til it's dark out and then come home and blow your back out/I hope that's OK?” After years of cold-hearted, gothic mood pieces that cribbed from The-Dream's writerly breakup ballads and Jodeci's sex-crazed fantasies, Brent Faiyaz is leaving all of that baggage in the past. Icon is his gentle and mature pivot into the grown folks R&B canon.

The Oh shit, I'm pushing (or just hit) 30 album is a rite of passage for the R&B playboy. What comes to mind: the Don Draper-like commitment crisis of Dwele's 2008 project Sketches of a Man; Life Goes On, Donell Jones' regret-fueled 2000s time capsule, looking back at all the games he played throughout his 20s. But Faiyaz's emotional growth on Icon—stamped with a Raphael Saadiq executive producer credit that seems like it's just for show—isn't nuanced enough. The talk of settling down and staying in the crib feels like moodboard fodder, without any of the scraps of conversation and vivid stories that give a fly-on-the-wall view of actual personal relationships.

The problem is that his writing about being ready for love is not nearly as candid as his writing about running away from it. Fuck the World and Wasteland are full of thorny self-observations and critiques (“Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself?/How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?”) that explain his descent into clubrat deviance. On Icon, I don't get a sense for why, all of a sudden, Brent is ready to take that next life step. For instance, on “wrong faces.,” he's telling this girl to leave the streets and come home to him, but he doesn't explain to her (or us!) what exactly has changed about his mindset. Likewise, the lyrics of the almost-engagement anthem “strangers.” has a good amount of melodrama (“Baby, you were supposed to change your last name/And then it came all crashing down”), yet his chronicles of what went wrong are vague and one-sided: He did everything he could; she messed it up. I've been listening to him be a demon for five projects straight and now I'm supposed to believe he's a hopeless romantic just because he says so?

Brent's uncharacteristically shallow pen leaves a lot of the emotional heavy lifting to the vocals. That probably should be a disaster, considering he's never been a strong singer, but there's some life to his pitch-shifted riffs on '80s and '90s male R&B melodies. He doesn't have the church choir technicality to pull off the Jodeci-style stacked vocals of “world is yours.,” but it's fun to hear him try with helium-tinged chirps. The fat snares and cloudy soul of “pure fantasy.” have the weightless bounce of a new jack swing slow jam. The croons on “other side.” might have had a similar effect, if it wasn't shameless Benny Blanco co-produced funkless funk chasing that The Weeknd bag. On “have to.,” his producer team (including longtime collaborator Dpat) laces him with a thunderous Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis bassline and sway to go with his computerized falsetto. There's a little bit of welcome uneasiness when he lilts, “I'm in a race with time to get where I belong,” like the pressure to get his shit together is weighing on him—an evolution from the nothing-matters dicking around of lines like Wasteland's “We both still young, so what's the rush?”

“have to.” teases the feeling of walls closing in on him, but Faiyaz fully explores that state on “butterflies,” one of his best songs to date. Dreamy, stripped-down production makes it seem like he's walking down the wedding aisle in slow motion with no idea what he's going to do. He toggles between excitement and tenderness and doubt and uncertainty, from the smoothly sung opening line, “Maybe it's a little bit rushed, but I'm falling in love.” Meanwhile, pitched-down vocal echoes sweep into the hook, intensifying the anxiety that's creeping in. By the time he chooses her and the mood turns celebratory, with swelling, crushed-up vocals that turn him into a one-man Mint Condition, the euphoria still has a hint of nerves. It's so raw. It's the exact sort of emotional dilemma that humanized his womanizer antics. It's one of the few times on Icon where he makes love feel like more than a catalyst for a rebrand—the rare moment he brings the playful specificity and honesty of his player music to the frightening thrill of commitment.

Ragger make an early bid for “most peculiarly fascinating cover album of 2026” with Euphonic Sounds, just over half an hour of 16-bit electro renditions of ragtime. Together, multi-instrumentalists Marc Riordan and Jon Leland craft a sui generis anachronism, hellbent on lovingly refracting the century-old sound through a contemporary prism. Inspired by Sousa marches and postbellum dances like the cakewalk, ragtime took off in the 1890s and defined the sound of its era. But rather than allow that foundational genre of American music to languish in novelty, Ragger urge a reconsideration of ragtime's entrenched perception as pure whimsy.

Ragtime's jubilant origins in vaudeville and communal dancing are apparent in its euphonious melodies and playful rhythms. It laid the groundwork for big band jazz, Harlem stride piano, and early blues before its appropriation by Tin Pan Alley songwriters and publishers. The genre derives its name from its “ragged” syncopation, eventually calcifying as the form typified by Scott Joplin's “Maple Leaf Rag” and “The Entertainer.” Euphonic Sounds skips those metonymic standards for a deeper selection of Joplin's catalogue (plus a single rag from fellow composer George Botsford). The time in which ragtime and its displaced beats posed a threat to “polite” (i.e., wealthy, white) society is long gone, allowing Ragger's Moogsploitation renovations to plainly invoke the complexity and joy of the original work.

With their initial rag anthology, Riordan and Leland have filled a lingering void, creating a Switched-On Joplin for the modern age. They were catalyzed by shared affection and curiosity, between Riordan's years fronting a ragtime quartet and the duo's bi-weekly residency at Zebulon in Los Angeles. Instead of excavating the decaying digitalia of the '80s or drowning in myopic sentiment, Ragger serve a pixelated platter of faithful synthesizer and V-drum performances of early 20th-century American popular song.

From the outset, Euphonic Sounds presents itself as a spinning teacup ride, owing as much to Ragger's gonzo instrumentation as the music's natural buoyancy. “Peacherine Rag” is giddily carnivalesque, placing the high and unadorned melody above a rhythmic engine of gently stomping bass chords and found-object percussion. The album's timbre rarely wavers from its two-man American Fotoplayer blueprint, briefly introducing vibraphone on “Paragon Rag” and relatively subdued organ on “Weeping Willow.” Bit-frayed textures threaten sugar overload, dousing nostalgia in overwhelming Super Nintendo sweetness. The sustained marching two-step only begins to wear thin towards the record's end; the album benefits from its short runtime and modest touches of variety.

A few tracks serve primarily as a display for Riordan's virtuosity, briefly abandoning or minimizing Leland's toy chest of thwacking samples. “Original Rags,” the first of Joplin's published rags, is a solo keyboard Ferris wheel, encapsulating the air of ease and whimsy that masks ragtime's technical difficulty. The deftness required to nail the relentless 16th-note melodies grows more transparent when unadorned. Riordan's stripped solo toward the end of “Swipesy Cakewalk” only heightens the contrast when the hollow drums return to land the finale. Ragger diverge from the breeziness of many recorded rag performances, zeniths of the 1970s rag revival like Peter Eden's Plugged In Joplin and Joshua Rifkin's best-selling trio on Nonesuch, letting their synthetic sheen add fullness and richness, keeping the freewheeling dance of chord stabs aloft and maintaining its inertia.

By representing antiquated musical styles with vigorously bright and cheery tones that would sound equally vintage in 1976 or 2026, Ragger exit the time flow and ask for the music to be taken as it is. Leland and Riordan's reactive approach to the work of a beloved composer, embellished only with timbre and junk percussion, places a cornerstone of American popular and classical music within their weirdo experimental purview. They open a ragtime rabbit hole and invite the outside world to dive in.

	Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested in Norfolk, England, on Thursday morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The British royal, formerly known as Prince Andrew before being stripped of his titles by his brother King Charles, is being detained by Thames Valley Police. 


	The police did not name Mountbatten-Windsor, in accordance with U.K. law, but confirmed they arrested a man in his sixties (the royal turned 66 today). The police also confirmed they are searching “addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.”


	“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement (via the BBC). “It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offense. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”

	











	The news comes after photos began to circulate of police vehicles at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, where Mountbatten-Windsor currently lives. The arrest is related to recent revelations in the Epstein files that suggest Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade reports to Jeffrey Epstein in 2010, not to ongoing allegations of sexual misconduct.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles by King Charles III in October following revelations about his relationship with Epstein. Earlier this month, the British monarch forced his brother to vacate his longtime home at Royal Lodge near Windsor Castle.

	











	King Charles III released a statement on the arrest of his brother. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” he wrote. “What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”

	The former prince has continually denied any wrongdoing; however, he was mentioned and pictured several times in the 3 million-plus pages of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice recently. One of the mentions of Mountbatten-Windsor is a photograph of him with a woman who appears to be Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager.


	Giuffre was one of Epstein's most prominent accusers and also filed a high-profile sexual-assault lawsuit against Andrew, which was settled in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide last April. Her family released a statement following Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. “At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” her siblings said in a statement distributed to news outlets. “On behalf of our sister, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, we extend our gratitude to the U.K.'s Thames Valley Police for their investigation, and the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”

	Prince William and Princess Catherine recently shared a rare public statement distancing themselves from Mountbatten-Windsor. “I can confirm that the Prince and Princess of Wales have been deeply concerned by the continued revelations,'' the palace said in a statement on Feb. 9. “Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”

North West has signed to Gamma, former Apple executive Larry Jackson‘s independent music company that's vying to be a top contender in the industry. Sources confirmed the news to Rolling Stone and said North has been spending time in the studio.


	Since its 2023 launch, Gamma has collaborated with the likes of Mariah Carey, Usher, Sexyy Red, and Snoop Dogg — with the Doggfather moving Death Row under Gamma's umbrella for distribution services. The media company has also brought in North's father Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, who inked a partnership deal with Gamma for the release of Bully, his 12th studio album set to arrive on March 20.


	At 12 years old, North, a scion of Kim Kardashian and Ye's celebrity empire, appears poised to chart her own path in music. Her recent single, “Piercing on My Hand,” which arrived on Feb. 6, was reportedly released via Gamma and produced by Ye and Will Frenchman. In January, North debuted the track live alongside her father in Mexico City in front of nearly 40,000 attendees, and the pair also performed Ye's 2014 dedication to his eldest daughter, titled “Only One,” plus ¥$ tracks “Talking” and “Bomb.”

	











	North previously appeared on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's Vultures single “Talking/Once Again,” which reached Number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted in the U.K. She also featured on FKA Twigs‘ “Childlike Things” on the Grammy winner's album Eusexua — which saw North rapping in both English and Japanese over Twigs' electronic dance beat.

	As North carves her own name in music, she also seems to be taking early steps toward a fashion venture. People confirmed earlier this week that her mother, Kardashian, applied for multiple trademarks for a fashion and accessories company called “NOR11” back in January.


	In a recent Rolling Stone article, music editor Jeff Ihaza declared that as “the celebrity children of the 2010s come of age and follow in their parents' footsteps, we've arrived at the next generation of nepo babies.” Still, he remarked, given North's fluency in online culture and her unapologetic approach to music, fashion, and identity, she is “less a carbon copy of her parents than a Gen Alpha translation.”

A
s a former child star, Hilary Duff is often asked how she turned out OK. Maybe it's because of the 38-year-old actress-singer's self-described “trad wife” tendencies: She's happiest at home in Los Angeles, tending to her four children and her backyard chickens, making sourdough bread and crocheting. But the reality is more complicated. “It's easy to look at me from the outside and be like, ‘She's so balanced and grounded and has seemed to figure it out,'” she says over Zoom in late January. “But there's been a lot of ups and downs and struggles.”


	She answers the same question with her first album in more than a decade, Luck … or Something, out Feb. 20 via Atlantic. The title derives from the synth-heavy stunner “Adult Size Medium,” where she sings, “How did we get here?/Was it luck or something?” “I am happy with who I am,” she adds. “But the ‘or something' is really the meat of the answer.”


	The last time Duff released new music, in 2015, Barack Obama was president, Mad Men had recently aired its series finale, and she'd just met her future husband, musician-producer Matthew Koma. “We got set up through my A&R person, and we ended up hanging for two hours, just talking about music,” Duff recalls on a second Zoom date, this time with Koma by her side. “Matt sent an email to his manager afterwards and was like, ‘She's really pretty.'” (“I said, ‘I want to marry her,'” Koma adds.) After dating on and off for several years, they tied the knot in 2019, and have worked closely together ever since.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Koma, 38, says that Duff was always “flirting” with the idea of returning to music, but she began to take it seriously in 2024, after the birth of their youngest daughter, Townes. Her only hesitance was how much the internet has changed culture in the past decade. “Everyone has a way to tell you how they feel about what you make, and that felt scary,” she says. “I was like, ‘Why would I subject myself to this? We have a happy life and amazing kids.' But obviously, I miss performing, and I desperately miss having that person be in the forefront.”

	With the rise of 2000s nostalgia, Duff has also found a younger fan base, including many people who were most likely born around the time her breakthrough album, Metamorphosis, was released in 2003. She was already a household name by then, thanks to starring in the Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuire and films like Cheaper By the Dozen, Agent Cody Banks, and A Cinderella Story. 


	By last year, the demand for new music had become feverish, and the internet erupted when she teased her return in September 2025. Fans proclaimed that she was “here to save pop music,” which stunned Duff. “That was not even real life,” she says. “I was like, ‘What the fuck is happening? Some bot did this.' It was not a normal day.”


	She did her best to push that pressure aside, with Koma urging her to simply make exactly what she wanted, with zero expectations. “We're not doing this for anybody,” he says. “There's nothing riding on this. This is for her.” As Duff recalls, “He was like, ‘We just have to make what we think is cool, what you want to listen to in your car.' He has a way of boiling everything down and making it super digestible for me. So that was the approach of the record. What keeps me up at night? What are my insecurities? The themes are what 10 years has brought on. It was super healing to make something that felt exactly like me, and where I am right now.”


	The result is a cohesive, no-skips record that offers an update on Duff's life, including honest looks at motherhood, marriage, and the passing of time. It's a pop record that holds very little back, offering a realistic, at times unglamorous portrait that is highly relatable. Lizzie McGuire made viewers feel seen because Duff was clumsy and awkward, falling into platters of spaghetti and getting dumped by her first boyfriend. She's still doing something similar now, 25 years later, as she mirrors our adult anxieties. “Are we having enough sex?/Are there exes you miss?” she sings on the glittery “Future Tripping Out.” “Will your crisis be a car/Or some bitch at a bar/Who says she loves Bon Iver/Calls him Bon Ivar?”

	“It was really important to me to not make a record that was like, ‘I'm a mom and I pick up my kids at school and pack lunches every day and it's so hard,'” she says. “It was not at all what I was interested in talking about. What I was interested in talking about is the shift in how it makes me feel, as a person.”

	











	Koma — who has collaborated with Britney Spears, Shania Twain, Zedd, and others — co-wrote Luck with Duff, and produced it alongside his longtime collaborator Bryan Phillips. Koma says the playful opener “Weather For Tennis” is a direct callback to the sonics of Duff's earlier work. “It's these pre-Hot AC, Michelle Branch-ish production models, but let's keep the core of the songwriting essence the same,” he says.


	That songwriting is sharper than ever, like on “Holiday Party,” where she wrestles with the fear of her husband cheating on her at a festive gathering (she says this is a recurring dream of hers). “I always think Matt's going to leave me for some coolio indie songwriter that he works with,” she says. “Which is so insane,” Koma replies. “But also very real. Those are real things to get hung up on emotionally.”


	Some of the strongest moments on the album are when Duff strikes a balance between bright, blissful pop melodies and sincere, even devastating lyrics. “I wish I could sleep on planes/And that my father would really love me,” she sings in “The Optimist,” a sparse tearjerker complete with cozy lap steel (played by Emily Rosenfield, who's also in Olivia Rodrigo's backing band and performed at Duff and Koma's wedding). “There's times where I talk to my dad and times where I don't talk to my dad,” Duff admits. “I do have a pretty sunny disposition, but a lot of shit has gone down, and that's life.”


	On “We Don't Talk,” she details another strained relationship within her family: ‘‘'Cause we come from the same home, the same blood/A different combination but the same lock.” When she played her first major concert in 18 years recently in London, she performed the delicate track on a mustard sofa. Fans speculated that the song was about Duff's sister, Haylie, from whom she's rumored to be estranged; some even went as far as to think the color of the couch was an Easter egg (to some online Sherlocks, it resembles a couch they saw in a video, case closed).


	“I feel almost like when I got divorced [in 2015], where I dealt with it privately, and then the news comes out and you're like, ‘OK, great. I'm going to deal with this all over again,'” Duff says. “I was prepared, a little bit. I made a choice to put that song on my record. That's definitely the most lonely part of my life, and I struggled with, ‘Am I going to share this?'” 

	











	Without directly naming the song's subject, she adds, “People have known my life since I was a child, and so they know all the characters in it and they know what I'm talking about. For me, it was important to be open about that theme. It genuinely came from the heart.”


	There's one thing she wants to push back on, though. “I was not, however, prepared for people to be like, ‘The couch is the color of the couch…' That is absolute bullshit, and totally not true and crazy. And I don't have the time to make threads for people to catch on to about that. I have a full life and a busy family, and this was literally just a song about my truth, and that was it.” 


	DUFF IS A MILLENNIAL through and through — she even samples Blink-182's “Dammit” on the new album's centerpiece, “Growing Up” — and like many of us in that generation, her TikToks are a work in progress. “I'm such an Instagram girly,” she says. “All my friends that are on TikTok are like, ‘You're living in the Stone Age.'”


	Even so, she does see some of the TikToks commenting on her music, like when she released “Roommates,” the addictive second single from Luck. “It was like, ‘This is Sabrina Carpenter reheated in the microwave,'” she tells me. “I was like, ‘How do people even get these mean terms? It's so fucked up!' And then I go into the comments and someone's like, ‘Does anybody realize she was here first?'” 


	She goes on: “Everybody's insane. Pop music is pop music. I realize that the talking heads on TikTok need to have something to say, and luckily for the most part, it's been super positive and nice. And then the mean ones stand out and I'm like, ‘Your hair color is literally terrible! Let's talk about your hair color!'” 


	When planning her comeback tour — an intimate run she called Small Rooms, Big Nerves, prior to announcing her upcoming world trek, the Lucky Me Tour — Duff was forced to contend with all aspects of her musical past. “I have a big discography, which is a blessing and a curse,” she says. “Some songs are embarrassing, and some are super fucking good.” Her set list features several Luck tracks, but it's mostly a love letter to fans, as she winds back the clocks and tears through gems like “So Yesterday,” “Come Clean,” and “What Dreams Are Made Of.”  


	I ask her if she'll ever do the Metamorphosis deep cut “The Math,” a whimsical rocker that likens love to mathematical equations. When I explain to Duff that the line “I am calling you back/This is Star 69” taught me what the telephone re-dial code was, she says, “I literally die inside every time. Those lyrics? I'm ashamed.” Koma chimes in: “That's been our inside joke since day one. We're like, ‘All right, play ‘The Math' three times in the set!” 

	











	She does embrace one part of her past she used to find mortifying: Her onstage choreography for 2007's “With Love,” which became (what else?) a viral TikTok trend. “It took me a little while to find peace with it, and the humor in it,” she admits. “Obviously, it's silly and embarrassing. But the fact that people across the whole entire world take the time to learn a dance and make a costume and post it on the internet, I'm obsessed with it. It took me getting to 38 to be like, ‘Oh, I get this. I get this and I love it, and I'm here for it.'” 


	On tour, Duff brings fans onstage to join her in the “With Love” dance. They're usually decked out in 2000s fashion, from butterfly clips to space buns, or her signature outfits from The Lizzie McGuire Movie. She's considering including celebrity guests as the tour continues, similar to Carpenter's “Juno” arrests or Role Model's many Sallys. “It's also a great way to take a little break,” she jokes. “Mama needs a break.”


	During our first interview, while Duff is on tour in Toronto, our Zoom is briefly interrupted when Duff's nanny FaceTimes her, so her kids can say hello. Though she's reawakened her pop star persona, her primary focus is still her family; Koma even built a rehearsal space for Duff next door to his studio, so the family could all be together. “He's so romantic, this guy,” she says. 


	Duff tells me about the other day, when she was packing to leave for tour and doing a wardrobe fitting, trying on racks and racks of clothing while her seven-year-old daughter was sick upstairs. “In my mind, I'm like, ‘They're going to look back at this time and be like, I was sick and my nanny was painting my toes and my mom was downstairs shopping.' And I'm just like, my job sucks sometimes. You know what I mean? That should be me up there.” (Adding insult to injury, it turned out that her daughter was upstairs watching another Disney series, Bunk'd. “I was like, ‘What about Lizzie McGuire? Hello!'” Duff jokes.)

	By the time I attend Duff's Brooklyn show on Jan. 27, her children are with her backstage, taking slices of a sparkly cake, fittingly decorated with butterflies. There was palpable joy coming from the crowd, which is something she's still getting used to. As Koma told me earlier, “She's such an unaware person sometimes, of how much she means to people. And I understand that, because I think it would be a weird thing to live in a reality where you were too in touch with that. So it's a beautiful thing that she's not, but it's also beautiful to see her have those moments where you can't deny how celebrated and how deeply [she's] affected people.”

	











	To this, Duff concedes. “I do feel like one of my magic tricks is being able to connect with people. To be able to reach them and relate to them, and them feel close to me.” But can she actually save pop music? “That's too big of a responsibility,” she says, “but it does make me chuckle.”

	Country hitmaker Megan Moroney was honored Wednesday at the second annual Sharing the Spotlight awards hosted by She Is The Music, the nonprofit advocacy group for women in the music industry co-founded by Alicia Keys.


	“I'm not even gonna play with y'all. I can't believe Alicia Keys knows who I am,” Moroney said with a laugh as she accepted her Artist Spotlight award, which recognized both her breakout success and the all-female team behind her career, including her manager Hayley Corbett, agent Elisa Vazzan, publicist Jensen Sussman, and tour manager Chelsae Partosan. A platinum-selling singer-songwriter and critical favorite, Moroney previously won the Country Music Association's New Artist of the Year award in 2024.


	“I'm inspired every time I get to be in a room with badass women who change the game every day, who do things their own way, and who don't take no for an answer,” Moroney said at the packed event in West Hollywood. “I think sometimes we're taught, subtly or not, that there's only room for a few women at the top. But music and creating art isn't a competition for oxygen. I'm positive that when one of us wins, it stretches the ceiling higher for the next girl watching.”

	











	Speaking with Rolling Stone, Keys said she was impressed by Moroney “consciously bringing incredible women into the scene.” The Grammy award winner said she founded She Is The Music with UMPG CEO Jody Gerson, mix engineer Ann Mincieli, and UTA's co-Head of Music, Sam Kirby Yoh, after seeing a 2018 USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative report that found women remained severely underrepresented in the music industry. The report found that the ratio of male to female producers across 400 popular songs was 47-to-1.


	“We saw these statistics coming back, showing there really aren't enough women in the seats and positions of power. But we were there, so we knew it was possible,” Keys tells Rolling Stone. “We decided to take matters into our own hands and really create the pathways, the opportunities, the sisterhoods, and the power to bring us all together and show each other how to cultivate the possibilities together.”

	“I've worked in this industry since vinyl,” Rhone told the crowd, recalling a time when women were “rarely, if ever, in line for C-suite or even vice presidential roles.” Women were present, she said, “often the most prepared, often the most intuitive,” but they were not “at the head of the table, not always holding the final pen, and certainly not in these numbers.”


	Though she described the current moment as “tumultuous — politically, economically, technologically,” Rhone struck an optimistic note. “Creativity adapts,” she said, “and women, especially women, innovate under pressure.” Looking out at the audience, she added, “I'm not anxious about the future of our industry at all. I'm energized by it. Music is in very good hands. So let's keep opening doors wider than we found them.”

	After Stephen Colbert claimed that CBS lawyers blocked The Late Show from airing an interview with James Talarico — a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Texas — for fear the network would meet the displeasure of the Federal Communications Commission, FCC chair Brendan Carr downplayed the controversy.


	During the agency's press conference on Wednesday, Carr insisted there was “zero censorship with the equal time provision.” “You had a Democrat candidate who understood the way that the news media works, and he took advantage of all of your sort of prior conceptions to run a hoax, apparently for the purpose of raising money and getting clicks,” Carr told reporters.


	On Monday night's episode of The Late Show, Colbert alleged that the FCC has begun cracking down on liberal-leaning broadcasters under the guise of enforcing the “equal time” rule. The so-called equal time rule requires broadcast and radio stations to offer “equal opportunities” to political candidates running against each other. However, there have historically been exceptions to the rule, including talk shows like The Late Show, as well as documentaries, on-the-spot interviews, and scheduled newscasts. Under Carr's leadership, the FCC has moved to strip those protections from liberal-leaning broadcast outlets, while exempting other broadcasts like right-wing talk radio.

	While the interview with Talarico did not make it on air, Colbert announced that their conversation would instead be distributed on the show's YouTube channel. In a statement to CNN, CBS claimed that they had not prohibited Colbert from airing the interview. “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett,” the broadcaster said, adding that The Late Show decided to post the interview on social media “rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

	Amid Carr's claims of “zero censorship,” the FCC chair also confirmed that the commission has started a probe into The View‘s alleged violations of equal time rules. Earlier this month, reports surfaced that Carr had opened an investigation into ABC's long-running panel show after it hosted Talarico for an interview. 


	“Disney has a program called The View. And they've been asserting the position that The View is what is known as ‘bona fide news' in the statute,” Carr said when popping on FOX News Channel's The Ingraham Angle on Wednesday night. “If you are bona fide news, you don't have to give candidates equal air time. But, Disney and The View have not established that that program is, in fact, bona fide news. We've started enforcement proceedings, taking a look at that. And, again, we're going to hold broadcasters accountable.”

Former US President Barack Obama joined a popular podcast this week and seemingly admitted that aliens were “real"". In an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama appeared to confirm the existence of extraterrestrials during a lightning round segment, where he gave rapid-fire answers to quick questions.

By the next day, Obama moved to clarify his statement, saying on social media that his response was made in “the spirit of the speed round."" He added that the chances Earth has been visited by aliens are “low"" and stressed that he saw “no evidence"" of extraterrestrial life during his presidency.

Here's a look at what former US Presidents have said on aliens and UFOs

Jimmy Carter: The President Who Filed A UFO Report

Jimmy Carter stands out as the only US President to formally report seeing what he believed was a UFO. In 1969, Carter said he witnessed a mysterious flying object in Georgia along with several others. He later filed a report with the International UFO Bureau in 1973 and even promised during his presidential campaign to make UFO information public. However, once in office, Carter changed his stance, saying releasing certain information could harm national security. He also took a symbolic step toward extraterrestrial contact by placing a message of peace aboard NASA's Voyager spacecraft, intended for any intelligent life that might encounter it.

Ronald Reagan: Aliens As A Warning And A Metaphor

Ronald Reagan also claimed to have seen an unidentified flying object while on a plane in the 1970s, according to accounts from his pilot. As US President, Reagan frequently used the idea of an alien invasion as a metaphor for global unity during the Cold War. In a famous 1987 speech at the United Nations, Reagan said humanity's divisions might disappear if Earth faced an extraterrestrial threat.

Bill Clinton: Searching For Secrets

Bill Clinton openly admitted that he had asked aides to investigate whether the government was hiding alien evidence, particularly at the secretive Area 51 military base. He also expressed curiosity about the 1947 Roswell incident, one of the most famous UFO cases in history. Clinton later joked that he hoped any alien encounter would not resemble the hostile invasion portrayed in Hollywood films.

Congressman Eric Burlison has claimed he heard reports of a crashed alien craft “so large it cannot be moved.” 

On a Newsmax TV interview with Rob Finnerty, Burlison proclaimed: “I'm not going to mention the country because I heard of it inside of a closed setting, and I want to protect my classification level.”

Burlison says he hasn't personally verified the craft, as it comes down to politicians' jurisdictions being closed off when investigating classified materials: “I'm having a difficult time getting access to facilities that are just within a few miles from my office in Washington, DC,” he added. 

The congressman refrained from explicitly mentioning which country he was referring to by alluding to confidentiality agreements. 

“To try to attempt to go to another country and get permission at that level is going to be somewhat insurmountable.”

As the case for governmental transparency gains traction, Burlison remains committed:  


If I come under any hard evidence… I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe.


Burlison's comments follow up on a recent observation about UAP videos from a Pentagon briefing, addressing the frustration of slow communication at the top regarding UFO disclosure.

Meanwhile, in the same interview, Dr. Steven Greer claims multiple alien craft have been “brought down,” some “bigger than a football field.”

Greer, a retired trauma physician turned prominent UFOlogist, named a specific location: “One [craft] in the mountains outside Seoul. It was so huge they had to build a structure around it.” Greer stipulated he was able to mention this as he is not bound by the same confidential terms as Burlison.

Greer also mentioned another craft near Fort Sill, Oklahoma, allegedly concealed by a structure, though it wasn't as elaborate as the Korean site, suggesting a highly cordoned-off area stateside.

Tellingly, he also mentioned that he had been in contact with a top-secret Pentagon-connected informant, without naming them officially, as dialogue seems tentative yet ongoing.

These claims come amid renewed interest in UFOs, following recent remarks by Barack Obama on The Brian Tyler Cohen Show: “They're real, but I haven't seen them.” 

He added, “They're not being kept at Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

Obama later clarified that he had been participating in a quick-fire round of questioning, with the interview not necessarily centered around UAP disclosure – unlike some of his more leftfield contemporaries.

This exposure, along with the Burlison and Green interview, concurs with the circulation (though heavily redacted for the public) of the Pentagon UAP reports, which include over 750 sightings from May 2023 to June 2024.

Twenty of those sightings were considered worthy of investigation, indicating that the case for whistleblowers is gaining traction as more evidence comes under the spotlight.

Sam Raimi's latest directorial venture, the survival horror movie Send Help, is on the verge of completing three weeks in theaters. After posting impressive numbers during the Feb 13-15 weekend, the film collected $1.3 million on its third Monday, a 46.8% drop from Sunday but a strong 37.8% jump from last Monday.

With an additional $0.9 million earned on Tuesday, the film's domestic total has climbed to $49.9 million, making it the highest-grossing release of 2026 so far in North America, according to Box Office Mojo's annual chart. At its current pace, Send Help is tracking to finish its domestic run in the $60-70 million range.

At the worldwide box office, Send Help has surpassed 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple ($57.6 million) and was recently overtaken by Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi's steamy romance Wuthering Heights ($92 million). Currently the second-highest-grossing title of 2026 worldwide so far, the Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien starrer is now closing in on the global haul of Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015), the sixth installment in the popular found-footage horror franchise. Here's a look at how much more Send Help needs to earn to outgross it globally.

Let's take a closer look at how the two films stack up at the domestic and global box office, based on Box Office Mojo data:

Send Help – Box Office Summary

Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension – Box Office Summary

Based on the above figures, Send Help is just $4.1 million away from surpassing Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension worldwide, a gap it could close within a few days if its current momentum holds. Interestingly, Sam Raimi's survival horror has performed significantly stronger in North America, earning nearly three times the domestic total of the 2015 found-footage sequel. However, The Ghost Dimension holds a clear advantage overseas. If Send Help maintains steady international legs with a solid domestic run, it is well-placed to overtake the franchise entry globally in the coming days.

Here's how Send Help stacks up against every entry in the Paranormal Activity series at the global box office, based on Box Office Mojo figures (Box Office Mojo):

With a current worldwide total of $74.8 million, Send Help is poised to outgross The Ghost Dimension, the lowest-grossing film in the Paranormal Activity franchise. However, it still trails the next entry, The Marked Ones, by roughly $16.1 million and remains far behind the franchise's top performers, all of which crossed over $140 million globally.

If the Sam Raimi directorial holds a steady momentum in the next few weeks, it appears well-positioned to surpass at least The Marked Ones at the global box office. The final outcome should become clearer in the coming weeks.

The film features a high-concept survival story centered on Linda (Rachel McAdams), an underappreciated employee, and Bradley (Dylan O'Brien), her difficult boss. Their lives take a dramatic turn when they become the only survivors of a plane crash and find themselves stranded on a desolate island. Now, the two must set aside their differences and work together to survive in these harsh conditions.

Donald Trump is reportedly ready to speak about aliens and extraterrestrial spacecraft present on Earth. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, claimed on a podcast that the president refused to come clean when she asked about aliens, but she has heard about a speech. 

Lara Trump, Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, has claimed that the president has a speech prepared for the day he addresses the discovery of alien life. The 43-year-old was speaking on the New York Post's Pod Force One podcast, where she stated that her father-in-law was being ""really coy"" when she and Eric (her husband) asked him if he knew something about extraterrestrials. On the podcast, Lara was asked about former President Barack Obama's admission about aliens in a recent interview. Talking to podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama seemingly confirmed the existence of extraterrestrials. But he changed his stance the next day, stressing that he saw “no evidence"" of aliens as president. Host Miranda Devine asked Lara if Trump is preparing to make an announcement on aliens. ""Do you think that he's about to make an announcement about UFOs, because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president?” the host asked.

“What's kind of funny is we've kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we're like, ‘Well, what do you know?'” Lara said. She said that Trump “played a little coy” when she and Eric inquired about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. “Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won't even fully tell us, maybe there's more to it,'” she said. Lara then went on to admit that she had heard that her father-in-law even has a speech prepared. “I have just heard kind of around that he's actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don't know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.

There have been reports that Trump is gearing up to make an announcement on extraterrestrial life and objects that have been gathered over the years. A few days ago, he reportedly permitted the release of all information on secret UFO facilities in the United States, such as Area 51. US Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri had sought permission from the president to visit these secure locations tied to UFOs and secret government projects. Over the years, many whistleblowers have confessed that the US is hiding bodies of aliens who visited Earth, and the wreckage of their spacecraft. However, all governments have rubbished these claims.

""You took something from us..."" Shudder has unveiled their freaky official trailer for a new indie horror film called Bodycam, another new found footage horror. This one is being pitched as Cops meets Paranormal Activity, with a dash of Event Horizon thrown in (when the s&!t hits the fan). Two police officers investigate a domestic dispute but there's an accidental shooting. Not wanting to be crucified by the public, the officers attempt to cover it up, only to uncover that the cameras aren't the only things watching them. According to reviews, it's ""equipped with plenty of scares, yet also deeper overtones of how people lose their humanity in the participation of systemic evil (policing in this case). Also very impressive what they did with the effects given the budget."" Though other critics say that it ""would've worked so much better as a V/H/S segment."" Bodycam film stars Jaime Callica, Sean Rogerson, Catherine Lough Haggquist, Angel Prater, and Keegan Connor Tracy. Have a look if you want some horror blending ""visceral dread with cosmic terror.""

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Brandon Christensen's horror film Bodycam, direct from YouTube:







When two police officers show up to investigate a domestic dispute, a startling escalation leads to a tragic accident. Not wanting to be crucified by the public, the officers attempt to cover it up – only to reveal that their body cameras aren't the only things watching them. Bodycam, also known as 911: Llamada Infernal in Spanish or POV: Presença Oculta in Portuguese, is directed by Canadian genre filmmaker / VFX artist Brandon Christensen, director of the horror movies Still/Born, Z, Superhost, The Puppetman, and Night of the Reaper previously, plus many other shorts. The screenplay is written by Brandon Christensen & Ryan Christensen. Produced by Chris Ball, Brandon Christensen, Kurtis David Harder. This originally premiered at the 2025 Popcorn Frights Festival in the US last year. Shudder releases Brandon Christensen's Bodycam horror film streaming on Shudder starting March 13th, 2026 coming soon. So who wants to watch this?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Best Quote of Every 'Supernatural' Season","https://collider.com/supernatural-best-quote-every-season/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:57:12 GMT","

For an impressive fifteen seasons, Supernatural dominated television as the most prolific genre series in modern day. Blending horror, fantasy, and action together in a road trip style almost befitting of a Western, the Eric Kripke-created series became an international phenomenon that has spawned an entire franchise worth of material. Whether you love everything Supernatural or prefer the original Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) adventures, there are more than 300 episodes to pull from and enjoy.

It's hard to perfectly capture a line that embodies an entire season, but we've done our best to collect the quotes that represent each season of Supernatural. Some are imperfect, we'll admit to that, but each of them says something about their respective season or the series as a whole, especially when examined after the fact. So, without further ado, start your engines and grab some rock salt, because here are the quotes that define each season of Supernatural.

An oldie but a goodie, there is no single quote that so perfectly defines not just the first season but all Supernatural. Spoken first by Dean in the second episode, ""Wendigo,"" the ""saving people, hunting things"" line has become so synonymous with the program that it could just as easily be a logline for the show. We certainly couldn't argue with that. In some ways, the line perfectly embodies everything that Supernatural was originally about.

Each episode sent the brothers to a new town, a new place, as they hunted down evil and saved those tormented by it. As time went on, the Winchesters strayed a bit from the ""family business,"" especially the ""saving people"" part, but back in Season 1, that was all it was about. Sure, they were still looking for their missing father, but that was almost an afterthought to all the urban legends and ghostly horrors they dealt with first.

Coming from the first episode of the second season, ""In My Time of Dying,"" Dean's epic reminder is arguably his greatest line on the show. But in the context of Season 2, it speaks to the endless cycle of self-sacrifice and resurrections that would begin here — and follow the program through its end. Sure, Dean was (unknowingly) speaking to a reaper here, but it speaks to the show's unwavering boldness in the face of network change-ups between seasons.

The ""always keep fighting"" mantra would become a major driving force of the Supernatural fandom in the years to come, but it could easily be traced back here. As Sam and Dean continue to fight against the Yellow-Eyed Demon that haunted them from childhood, the Winchesters must continue to choose the life they've decided to lead. Unsurprisingly, they do.

Another line that's become so popular that it could easily describe the series as a whole, this Season 3 quote came from Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) in the climactic finale ""No Rest for the Wicked."" Like any good surrogate father, Bobby chooses to stick with the boys through everything that's coming, even if it means facing Lilith (Sierra McCormick) and a pack of hellhounds. Considering his increased role in the third season, it reminds us that the series was still finding its sea legs even after all these years.

Of course, another quote that may do even more justice to this season comes from Lauren Cohan's Bela Talbot. As she remarks in ""Bad Day at Black Rock"": ""We're all going to Hell, Dean. Might as well enjoy the ride."" Given Dean's ""one year to live"" throughout the third season, it's another quote that really rings true to the overall theme of these 16 episodes.

Season 4 was a year of many firsts for Supernatural as the series moved further from its horror roots and turned into a fantasy adventure that dealt with cosmic scales and world-ending implications. Spoken by Castiel (Misha Collins) in the premiere, ""Lazarus Rising,"" this quote is a harrowing symbol of what is to come, as Dean is resurrected not of his own accord nor his brothers, but seemingly by the will of Heaven itself. Talk about a massive rebrand!

Tonally, this line reminds us that the stakes are higher now than they ever have been, and if Dean has been brought back from Hell for a purpose, that purpose must also be severe. It's one heck of a season opener, too. Additionally, the line speaks to the bond that would be formed between Dean and Castiel over the course of this season, and eventually the greater series.

Concluding the arc first established in Season 4 (and the overall myth arc that Kripke set out to tell), Season 5 is a killer finale if you want to watch an abridged version of the program. Sam's line to his brother here in ""Swan Song"" shows the younger Winchester's strength in his battle against the Devil (one he's been fighting all season) and that his love for his brother is what gave him the power to overcome Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino) in the first place. It's simple, but profoundly effective.

It also precedes Sam jumping into Hell himself, leading to Dean being left alone to start a new life. While the remaining ten seasons would put an axe on that, this was an era of Supernatural that knew how to tell a story that felt finite and contained. It turns out that love truly is all you need to conquer the forces of evil. Well, love and sacrifice.

After Kripke left and Sera Gamble took over, fans weren't quite sure of the new direction that Supernatural was taking. With a souless Sam who was unable to feel any of those previously expressed ideas and a Dean struggling with a work-life balance, it didn't feel like the same show. So when Dean said these words in ""Clap Your Hands If You Believe...,"" it almost felt like the audience trying to get the attention of the writers.

While the sixth season would eventually course correct (with Kripke even returning to pen the season finale), it just couldn't recreate the show that we were used to. Sure, Season 6 still has plenty of gems like ""The French Mistake"" and ""Weekend at Bobby's,"" but those are the exception to the otherwise strange norm that the show created in its uneven Season 5 follow-up. Still, we're glad that the show got over this slight hump.

Remember that brief moment when Bobby was killed, and he hadn't been confirmed to be sticking around as a ghost just yet? Yeah, that's where Frank Devereaux (Kevin R. McNally) came in, and he was nothing like the old grouchy mechanic who used to pal around with Sam and Dean. But he did offer one piece of sage wisdom that spoke to the general atmosphere of Season 7: suck it up and keep going.

Still in the Gamble era, Season 7 was overly reliant on jokes about Dick Roman's (James Patrick Stuart) name and noncommittal in which cast members the show wanted to kill or revive. Either way, though they're meant to be an encouragement to Dean, Frank's words speak quite clearly to the state of the program. We're not sure if that's a good thing or not, but at least the show was eventually able to move past this strange era.

When Jeremy Carver took over Supernatural in Season 8, it felt as if anything were once again possible. Sending Sam and Dean back on the road, reestablishing the status quo, and putting them on the path to closing the gates of Hell forever seemed like the best way forward after two monster-heavy seasons. So, when Dean reminded Sam of this in the season finale, ""Sacrifice,"" it's a powerful reminder to the audience that Supernatural is back.

Of course, in-universe, it also very clearly addresses Dean's constant pull toward supernatural creatures. First Castiel, then Benny the vampire (Ty Olsson), and later Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard). But even in all that, Dean reminds Sam that what makes Supernatural work is that the two of them are always there to fight evil, side by side, and he'll ultimately choose his brother over anyone else. It may not be healthy, but it makes the show work.

Even if Crowley wasn't talking to anyone specific in ""King of the Damned,"" these words would ring true for Season 9. After the excitement that was Season 8, the ninth season is a bit of a letdown. In some stretches, the Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) plotline does feel like torture, as does the never-ending battle to figure out what Castiel's role on the show is post-Apocalypse. The show had again lost its direction.

Additionally, Sam is tortured in the sense that he's possessed by an angel (who kills one of their closest allies), Dean is tortured in that he receives the Mark of Cain and ends the season as a demon, and Crowley is tortured in that he's significantly less effective this season than he was the last. After a stellar eighth season, the follow-up is subpar. At least it sets up some interesting stuff.

For Supernatural's tenth season, the show went back to its roots by focusing largely on Sam and Dean, which didn't give some of the supporting cast a ton to do. Still, Dean's remark to Crowley here in ""Inside Man"" reminds us that even though Castiel and Crowley weren't exactly the standouts of Season 10, the audience was still invested in them. Perhaps that even goes for Sam and Dean as well.

Put aside the weird friendship between Dean and Crowley, and this whole scene just speaks to the existence of the entire show. After all, Dean also quotes Bobby's Season 3 line here about family not ending in blood. It's a full-circle moment that perfectly embodies the themes of the season, which extends also to Crowley's mother...

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","A Psychic Medium Just Spilled The Tea On Soul Contracts","https://dearmedia.com/what-are-soul-contracts-maryann-dimarco-art-of-being-well/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:04:57 GMT","

Ever have a phase where life starts feeling like a rerun…and not in a cute comfort-show kinda way? Same arguments, same situations, same “why am I like this” spiral—just with different outfits and a slightly new cast. Well, according to one psychic medium, there might actually be a reason for that.

On The Art of Being Well, host Dr. Will Cole sits down with spiritual teacher and bestselling author MaryAnn DiMarco to unpack soul contracts, spirit guides, intuition, and the invisible patterns shaping our relationships and choices. The conversation gets deep, comforting, and honestly kind of mind-bending in the best way.

Below are the highlights, adapted from the episode.

“My mom is a spiritualist. She always has been. She's been into the metaphysical and used to drag me around with her when I was a little girl to meditation classes. I was ‘om'-ing and trying to find my third eye at a very young age. I didn't even know what that meant, but I thought it was really cool…

…She made it very normal for me. And it wasn't until—I denied it for a very long time. I knew I was psychic, but I didn't really want to deal with it in a way that felt awkward and weird and out of place. I wanted to be normal. And so when I got into my thirties, I wound up going through a massive change in my life…I was getting divorced. I was dealing with deep grief. I had these two little children. And I wound up in the hands of a spiritual teacher, Pat Longo…She said to me, ‘I'm not a psychic. I'm a healer. And I teach people how to connect with their psychic abilities.' And I just thought, ‘Yeah, this is the time I'm supposed to do this.'”

“Soul packs are the people that we have in our lives right now. We have probably lived past lives with them. We go lifetime after lifetime. I'm not really clear as to why. I can only say that we learn from each other contractually. I know that some people in my life who have even been a fleeting moment, there was a contract there and it taught me something…

…I've done past life regression—I'm pretty sure I mothered my mother in a past life. I mother her often now. I'm sure she wouldn't mind me saying that if she listens to this podcast. Mom, I love you, but you know, I mother you. It's okay.”

“We all come here with lessons to learn. We have signed up for them. And so I just call them soul contracts. They are negotiable…I have a meditation that I do where I set up a boardroom and I go in with my guides and I'm like, ‘Look, I've worked on this real hard. Can we start to repurpose this or look at it in a different way?' But there are things like fear, doubt, comparison, impostor syndrome, all kinds of things that can come up in your life. And I always say the great way to recognize a soul contract is: is your story starting to annoy you? Are you starting to make choices that are repetitive? Do you keep repeating the same pattern? And when that occurs, try to recognize it as maybe this is a learning moment for you and this is a contract that you can work on.”

“I am not afraid to die…Getting there and being part of what I feel is complete love, ultimate peacefulness, higher awareness and knowing the answers that your soul couldn't come to realization in this life are being given. And I think we're returning home and that feeling of—you know, when you've been on a long trip and you just kind of throw your bags in your room and just plop down on your bed and there's something about that relief and that safety of being home? That is what I feel [during readings]. I'm a firm believer in it. And it's so comforting. It's probably one of the most comforting parts of my job is to know how well they are on that other side. And I do believe our work continues. I don't think it's something that we just sit around floating on a cloud. I think there's work there.”

“If you want to heal your body, you have to speak about your body in healing terms. If you want to heal your mind, you have to welcome that healing in and take accountability and responsibility and the action that you need to take in order to get that done…

…I am a person who will talk to my cells and say, ‘You are healthy, do your job,' you know? Or ‘Get to work,' whatever it is. If I'm feeling low in energy—I talk about going through menopause in [my book], and I had to really navigate what that was. I needed to speak about my body in a different way. It wasn't, ‘Hey, I'm gaining weight.' It was, ‘My body is trying to understand its balance.' I think you have to sort of really work it, but you want to get to the bottom of the reason. Please don't bypass it all. There's a reason why it comes up the way it does. So, make your mantras your own. One of my favorite and easiest things to say, however, is: please show me the way and I will say yes. Please open my eyes to the signs and symbols that I need. I will recognize them, be accountable, and I will say yes. I am ready now. I am ready to receive ‘fill in the blank.'”

“I still consider myself a Catholic at my foundation…I can tell you that I've been called a heathen and told I'm going to hell and all these things. I've received some very colorful emails, but it's not something that I really pay attention to…

…I think that it sits so well within my body that I know that it's right for me. I used to kind of be a little crass about it and I'd say, ‘I have one judge and jury and I'll worry about that when I get there.' But I don't really say that anymore as much. But there is an element of truth still behind it. I have work to do and I feel so called to do it that if my work is out of alignment for somebody else, it's really none of my business.”

“We're all psychic in some way. You do not have to come to a psychic medium for these things…I think we have a tendency to make it weird and odd—'Oh, she talks to the dead people. I don't do that'—but we all can do that. And I think depending on how we've been brought up, depending on societies that we live in, we've just been taught to forget it. And I think what we're starting to see now is, that veil is getting very, very thin. And that there's been a shift in perspective… 

…Consistency is key. And I think you have to be realistic about what you're asking yourself to do. Pick a day, write it out. whole week schedule, monthly schedule, I don't really care. If you wake up in the morning and all you can muster up is maybe some gratitude for a good cup of coffee that morning and a little half hour of peace and calm before you get your day started, that's perfect. If you are a person who can create a whole meditative space in your house and be there for an hour doing writings and bringing yourself to meditation—wonderful, then do that. Just do it consistently. If prayer in your temple, your church, wherever you are, is what is serving you in that moment, wonderful. Do it consistently. That's really all I ask because just like any other muscle, it needs care. It needs love. And we have to sort of allow ourselves to gradually work up this muscle. We also have to be aware that sometimes that might change up based on your lifestyle and your needs in the moment. And that's okay, too.”

It's August 4 1962, Marilyn Monroe's last day alive. She hasn't slept well, partly because of an argument she had with Pat Newcomb, her publicist turned close friend, the night before. Marilyn invited Pat to stay over at Fifth Helena Drive, her home in Los Angeles, because she is suffering from bronchitis and the actress thought a little rest and sunbathing would benefit her.

That morning, Marilyn takes some more sleeping pills that leave her feeling groggy. At 9am, she eats a grapefruit – or, according to another account, drinks a glass of grapefruit juice – and chats to Eunice Murray, her “devoted assistant” and housekeeper, who is due to spend the day at the house.

The actress does a little light gardening and takes delivery of a bedside table and some fruit trees that Murray will plant in the garden. At around 10am, photographer Lawrence Schiller drops by to show Marilyn some nude shots he took of her on the set of Something's Got to Give, which he hopes to sell to Playboy.

At around noon, Marilyn's former father-in-law, Isidore Miller – to whom she is still close despite the divorce from [her third husband, playwright] Arthur – phones the house, but Murray tells him Marilyn is dressing and will call him back. Marilyn spends some of the morning in her bedroom, talking on the telephone. She receives many calls congratulating her on the interview with Richard Meryman for Life magazine, which has just hit the newsstands.

Just after noon, Pat emerges from the guest room, having had more than 12 hours of sleep – a luxury beyond Marilyn's wildest imaginings and something that seems to enrage her. Pat enjoys an omelette cooked by Murray and made with herbs from the garden, but Marilyn eats nothing. The two women continue to bicker.

At some point during the early afternoon, Marilyn asks Murray whether there is any oxygen in the house, a question that strikes the housekeeper as so strange that she rings Dr [Ralph] Greenson, Marilyn's psychiatrist, to ask for his advice; he tells her he will call by at some point later.

At 4.30pm, Marilyn, sounding depressed, telephones Dr Greenson herself and he makes the short trip over to the house. “She was unhappy and complained about [Pat Newcomb] again, about not sleeping well, but after I had spent about two and a half hours with her, she seemed to quiet down,” he wrote in a letter to Marilyn's friend, the poet Norman Rosten. Greenson suggests that it would be better if Newcomb leave the house, which she does.

Between 5pm and 6pm, masseur and close friend Ralph Roberts telephones the house. Greenson picks up the phone and when Roberts asks to speak to Marilyn, he informs him she isn't at home and hangs up. After the session with Greenson is over, Marilyn tells him that she'd like to go for a walk on Santa Monica pier – she says it is a place that brings back the few happy memories from her childhood – but the psychiatrist warns her that she is too groggy.

Before he leaves, at around 7.15pm, he is so worried about Marilyn that he asks Murray to spend the night at Fifth Helena Drive, something she didn't often do. Greenson makes Marilyn promise to call him the next morning.

About half an hour later, he receives a call from her sounding much brighter – she tells him that the 20-year-old son of another ex-husband, Joe DiMaggio – has just rung to inform her that he isn't going to marry “some awful girl” and she felt “relieved about that”.

During the same conversation with Greenson, Marilyn asks the psychiatrist if he has taken away her bottle of the barbiturate sleeping pill Nembutal. “I was surprised that she asked me that,” he wrote in a letter to Marilyn's other therapist, Dr Marianne Kris. “I did not know she was taking Nembutal. She had stopped taking barbiturates for three weeks.”

Greenson denies removing the sleeping pills, at which point Marilyn changes the subject. “I thought perhaps she was just confused,” he said. “Anyway she sounded pleasant on the phone, although somewhat depressed, but by no means acutely so.”

The late afternoon into the early evening continues with a complicated game of telephone tag. At some point between 7pm and 8pm, the actor Peter Lawford calls Marilyn. Earlier on in the day he had invited her to a small dinner party at his Malibu beach house and he wants to check whether she's still coming. During the conversation her voice seems to “fade out” and when he tries to call back her line is busy.

Lawford is so concerned by what she says – “Say goodbye to Pat, say goodbye to Jack [JFK], and say goodbye to yourself because you're a nice guy” – that he contacts his manager, Milton Ebbins, who advises him not to go to Fifth Helena Drive – after all, not only has Lawford been drinking but he is the brother-in-law of the president. Ebbins, in turn, at 8.30pm, leaves a message for Marilyn's attorney, Milton Rudin (also Dr Greenson's brother-in-law), to call him. Fifteen minutes later the two men talk over the phone and Ebbins relates what he's heard from Lawford.

At 9pm, Rudin rings the house at Fifth Helena Drive and Eunice Murray picks up the phone. He asks about Marilyn and Murray reassures him that she is in her bedroom and that she is “all right”.

At some point that evening, Murray hears the telephone ring again in Marilyn's room. “I don't remember what time the call came in, and I don't know who it was from,” she told the Los Angeles Times a few days after the star's death. “But knowing Marilyn as I do, I think that if this call waked her up [sic] she might have taken some more sleeping pills.” Later, Murray would tell biographer Anthony Summers, “Marilyn had a phobia about sleeping, anything that would deter sleeping, especially after she had taken some sedation, and then she would have to take more – and that's dangerous, she told me that.” Marilyn was so neurotic about not being disturbed that Murray would not knock on the actress's door in case it woke her.

In the guest bedroom, Murray watches television and reads before she turns out her light and goes to sleep. At around midnight she wakes up and, after stepping out of her room, notices that the cord for one of the telephones is still under the star's bedroom door. (Marilyn had two lines; one of her night-time rituals – to ensure she was not disturbed – was to take the telephones out of her room.)

What happens next is unclear. According to the testimony of sergeant Jack Clemmons, the first police officer on the scene, Murray told him that Marilyn's body was discovered at around midnight. This is important, because official reports give the time of discovery as around 3.30am.

According to the official version of events, Murray woke up again at around 3.30am and saw that the phone cord was still under Marilyn's door. At this point, she didn't check whether the door was locked because she was still worried about incurring Marilyn's wrath in case she woke her up. Instead, she went outside, looked through the window and saw something that shocked her. “I saw Marilyn lying on the bed – face down, nude,” she said. “It was not a warm night, the light was on, and so everything was wrong. I was really in panic.”

She rushed inside and, using the second telephone, rang Dr Greenson, who told her to call Marilyn's physician, Dr Engelberg. When Greenson arrived shortly after, and found the bedroom door locked, he took a poker from the fireplace, went around to the side of the house, broke one of the panes of glass in a window not covered by rejas (Spanish/Mexican-style security grilles), opened the window to Marilyn's room and climbed in. She was lying face down on the bed, with her shoulders exposed; it was obvious to him that she was dead – “and as I got closer I could see the phone clutched fiercely in her right hand”, he wrote in a letter to Norman Rosten.

When Dr Engelberg arrived, he took out his stethoscope, checked Marilyn's pupils and confirmed that she was dead. The two doctors noticed that rigor mortis had set in. They also saw that Marilyn's bedside table was cluttered with bottles of pills. A later official report estimated that during the course of the evening, she had taken approximately 20 capsules of the sedative chloral hydrate and 25 x 100mg of Nembutal.

When asked about this key moment in the chronology in an interview done in the early 1980s, Murray said: “When you're in panic – when I'm in panic – I know now time has no… you're just not concerned about time. I was thinking just wildly about this horrible, how awful, what on earth is everybody going to do next.”

Murray's account is plausible; sometimes people in traumatic situations do lose all sense of time. But her opaqueness – and her surprising failure to note the time on the night of Marilyn's death – left police investigators suspicious. There have been other reports that suggest Marilyn died as early as 10.30pm on the Saturday night, and Dr Greenson did not report the death to the police until 4.25am on the Sunday morning.

Into the black hole of these few empty hours conspiracy theorists have injected a thousand wild conjectures. According to one of the most widely believed conspiracy theories, the delay in reporting the death would give Marilyn's supposed murderers time to clear the house of any incriminating evidence. Central to the question of the alleged cover-up is Marilyn's involvement with the Kennedy family.

Six weeks after Marilyn's death, sergeant Jack Clemmons met with two men who – like him – had a vested interest in digging up dirt on the Kennedys. Clemmons was a director of the Right-wing Fire and Police Research Association of Los Angeles – “If you haven't time to learn more about and to fight communism today,” runs the tagline for one of the organisation's newsletters, “you'd better start getting ready to learn how to live under it tomorrow!” Jim Dougherty, Marilyn's first husband, was a colleague of Clemmons's at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), where Jack was known for his extreme Right-wing views. “The old rascal, he hates the Kennedys,” said Dougherty. “He's so far Right, I can't tell you, if he stuck out his head he'd hit himself in the right eye… He would paint the Kennedys as black any way he could.”

Clemmons's co-conspirators in a battle to bring down the liberal Kennedy clan – whom they thought were too sympathetic to far-Left causes – were Maurice Ries, president of the anti-communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, and private detective turned Right-wing propagandist Frank Capell.

At that initial meeting in September 1962, the three men discussed the possibility of using Marilyn's death to besmirch the Kennedy brothers. Ries had heard a rumour that Marilyn had been having an affair with Robert Kennedy, then attorney general; according to hearsay, he had promised to marry her, but when he changed his mind she was so angry and bitter she threatened to expose him. In order to shut her up, so the story went, Kennedy had her murdered.

Clemmons and Capell joined forces to investigate Marilyn's death, determined to start a smear campaign. The result was the slim but poisonous pamphlet The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe, written by Capell, and published by The Herald of Freedom, a “national anti-Communist educational bi-weekly”, in July 1964.

When Clemmons and Capell discovered from Marilyn's autopsy – carried out by Thomas Noguchi on the morning of August 5 – the seemingly significant detail that no residues from the pills were found in the star's stomach, the two men believed they had stumbled upon evidence of foul play. (In fact, they misunderstood and misinterpreted the physical evidence: not all of those who die by overdose have traces of the drugs left in their stomachs.)

And so the fantastical murder plot was hatched. Like in a terrible whodunnit, Clemmons and Capell gathered together their suspects in the fetid drawing room of their dark imagination. “Many ‘suicides' and ‘heart attacks' and ‘accidental deaths' are in reality murders ordered by the Communist Party,” wrote Capell. “Marilyn was deeply involved with Left-wingers and identified Communists and her death has many suspicious aspects to it which we shall attempt to bring out by presenting documented evidence.” Capell calls out many in Marilyn's life as known or suspected communists – Arthur Miller, Dr Engelberg, Norman and Hedda Rosten [writers and friends of Monroe], Lee and Paula Strasberg [her acting teachers] – but he leaves the reader in little doubt as to who was to blame for Marilyn's death: Robert Kennedy.

“If Marilyn's death were really murder dressed up to look like an accident or suicide, who would have wanted her out of [the] way?” Capell asks. “The most likely [suspect] would be an ambitious man, already important but wanting to become more important and knowing that a serious scandal might ruin his chances for the biggest job of all. Would he take a gun and shoot her or personally involve himself in the dirty work? No, he would be devious as always and utilise the forces best qualified for the job – the Communist Conspiracy, which is expert in the scientific elimination of its enemies. Marilyn, already surrounded by doubtful people, was easy game.”

In an unpublished letter, written to lawyer and fellow Right-wing activist Helen Clay, dated September 3 1964, Capell admitted to using the Monroe case for his own political ends. He hoped that the resulting bad publicity “would bring home to the New York voters the truth about Bobby Kennedy”. He said that if Kennedy was elected senator, “I am afraid he will become the unofficial ‘Dictator' in Congress, since he has the support of every known Left-winger group, liberal group etc, etc…”

Robert Kennedy had made many powerful enemies, including J Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI. Kennedy – whose 1960 book The Enemy Within documented his battle with corrupt labour unions – believed that Hoover used his connections to the mob to try to dig up dirt on the Kennedy family. Hoover was so thrilled by Capell's central allegation that he took the trouble to write Robert Kennedy a memo that read, “Mr Capell stated he will indicate in his book that you and Miss Monroe were intimate, and that you were in Miss Monroe's apartment at the time of her death.” However, in the same cache of FBI files, it maintains that “the allegation concerning the attorney general and Miss Monroe has been circulated in the past and has been branded as utterly false”.

Throughout the 1960s, Hoover was on the look-out for anything that he could use to besmirch Robert Kennedy, but no matter how hard he searched, he couldn't find anything. William Sullivan, assistant director of the FBI, went on the record to state the truth of the matter.

“The stories about Bobby Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were just stories,” he said. “The original story was invented by a so-called journalist, a Right-wing zealot [Capell] who had a history of spinning wild yarns. It spread like wildfire, of course, and J Edgar Hoover was right there, gleefully fanning the flames.”

The rumour about Marilyn having an affair first with JFK and then RFK has been branded upon our collective consciousness. So what is the truth about Marilyn and the Kennedys? The first documented evidence of Marilyn and John F Kennedy being in the same room together is from April 12 1957, when they attended a charity event, the Paris Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria, in New York. Both were with their respective spouses – Marilyn with Arthur Miller, Senator Kennedy with his wife of three years, Jacqueline.

There are no photographs of Marilyn and Kennedy together from that evening, and it seems likely that they didn't even talk to one another that night. The next public event was JFK's birthday celebration, and Democratic gala fundraiser, at Madison Square Garden on May 19 1962, when Marilyn sang Happy Birthday in front of a crowd of 15,000 people. “I can now retire from politics after having had Happy Birthday sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way,” joked the president.

Afterwards, Marilyn – together with her date for the evening, Isidore Miller, Arthur's father, and her publicist Pat Newcomb – attended a party at the Manhattan townhouse of [movie studio head] Arthur and Mathilde Krim. This is where the famous photograph of Marilyn, JFK and RFK was taken, the only one known of the three together. In the image, it looks as though the president and his brother might be ogling the star, gazing down at her breasts. Often, in reproduction, the photo is cropped to show only Marilyn and the two Kennedy men, but in reality they were surrounded by a number of other guests.

It's clear that if Marilyn and the president – who, despite his philandering nature, had a public image as a happy family man – were conducting an affair, they would want to keep it out of the public eye. In various biographies there have been dozens of witnesses – some more reliable than others – who have testified that Marilyn and JFK had been lovers. The statements of Marilyn's friends such as Henry Rosenfeld, her masseur Ralph Roberts and [actress] Susan Strasberg – all of whom confirmed such a relationship between the two – should be taken seriously.

Rosenfeld maintained that Marilyn's relationship with JFK started after he became president in 1961 – “She was so excited you'd think she was a teenager” – but that the sexual contact between them was confined to “a very, very few times”. According to Rosenfeld, the couple used to meet up at a place on 53rd Street in New York, and Marilyn travelled to Washington a couple of times, although she never made it into the White House itself. “She would say, ‘I'm going to be with You Know Who again – he's so important',” said Rosenfeld. “She was going to bed with the president of the United States. She was awed by big names.”

According to Roberts, Marilyn called JFK “the Gentleman Caller”. At the end of March 1962, she phoned Roberts to tell him that the president had invited her to spend the weekend of 24 to 25 March in Palm Springs, at Bing Crosby's estate. She told Roberts she was going to travel in disguise, as she often did. “I'm wearing the black wig, carrying an attaché case. I have an identification card with a picture of me wearing the wig. Guess what my name is? Tony Roberts.” She went on to say that the president was anxious that she might be identified by her trademark sexy walk. “He says I would be recognised in the deepest part of Africa from it,” she said.

From Palm Springs, Marilyn telephoned Roberts again and told him about a conversation she had with a friend – whom he took to be the president – about her walk and her knowledge of physiology. During the call, she passed the phone to the president – Roberts recognised JFK's voice – and the masseur and the leader of the free world (and a sufferer of back problems) had a brief chat about the psoas muscle. “He [Kennedy] said that the little massaging I did on his back worked wonders,” she told Roberts on another occasion. “I replied that I'd learnt from a master. He remarked, ‘Well, he might be the master, but you added a touch I bet he doesn't have.'”

Those who believe the theory that Robert Kennedy killed Marilyn Monroe – or had her murdered – often cite a taped conversation between Dr Greenson and magician turned celebrity photographer Billy Woodfield, one of the first media representatives to turn up at Fifth Helena Drive in the early hours of August 5 1962. Working with journalist Joe Hyams of the New York Herald Tribune, Woodfield started to “play detective”.

The week after Marilyn's death he claimed that he'd discovered from a pilot's log in Santa Monica that a helicopter had been ordered to pick up a passenger from Peter Lawford's beach house in the early hours of August 5 and take them to Los Angeles Airport. “It showed clearly that a helicopter had picked up Robert Kennedy at the Santa Monica Beach,” Woodfield said. Woodfield and Hyams realised that if this were true, they had a big scoop on their hands and requested a comment from Robert Kennedy's office, which reportedly asked them not to run the story. Hyams wrote it up anyway and offered it to his newspaper, which decided not to publish it.

Woodfield did not pursue the story until the German magazine Stern contacted him in 1964 to check out the allegations contained in Frank Capell's book. During his research, Woodfield tracked down Dr Greenson and recorded their subsequent telephone conversation. The tape – which was featured on the 1985 television documentary Say Goodbye to the President – became famous for the following quote from Greenson: “I can't explain myself or defend myself without revealing things I don't want to reveal. You can't draw a line and I'll say, ‘I'll tell you this but I won't tell you that.'… It's a terrible position to be in to have to say I can't talk about it because I can't tell the whole story… Listen – talk to Bobby Kennedy.”

The implication was clear. Greenson's taped testimony suggested that Robert Kennedy was the person to blame for Marilyn's death. However, an examination of the whole taped conversation, instead of this edited segment, casts the so-called revelation in an entirely different light.

After Greenson tells Woodfield about the moral and ethical difficulties involved in talking to a journalist, he adds, “the stories of the gossips are quite fantastic”, a quote missing from the final broadcast. Woodfield asks Greenson whether he will sit down with him for a proper interview. The news of the Capell book is going to break soon, he says, and Greenson replies that nobody will listen if it's just read by a few people in the John Birch Society, a reference to the Right-wing group. This is the subject they are talking about when Greenson makes his famous “Listen – talk to Bobby Kennedy” comment. They are not discussing who is responsible for Marilyn's death or anything to do with Marilyn. Rather, they are discussing the possible impact of Capell's pamphlet. Here is the transcript:

Billy Woodfield: It's [Capell's book] going to break all over New York City just before the election. [Bobby Kennedy was standing to be New York senator, a position he secured in November 1964.]

Dr Greenson: Well, when that happens – listen – talk to Bobby Kennedy.

In fact, Robert Kennedy was nowhere near Fifth Helena Drive on August 4 or 5 1962. A set of 15 photographs taken over the course of that weekend places the attorney general, his wife, Ethel, and their four children, together with their hosts, John and Nancy Bates, at a ranch in Gilroy, northern California – over 300 miles away from LA. The Kennedy family arrived at the country home of Bates – a prominent Californian lawyer and a friend of JFK's from his navy days – on Friday August 3 and stayed until August 5.

It's time finally to bury the conspiracy theories. As Pat Newcomb stated in an unpublished interview, “Everyone tried to make something out of the most glamorous people of that particular era. That was what they decided to invent… I do not think she was murdered. I am certain she was not murdered. I do not think she meant to kill herself. I think it was an accidental suicide – period.”

With each passing year, Marilyn's fame seems to grow. Her image continues to haunt our culture. The life story of “the Love Goddess of the Nuclear Age”, as she was dubbed by the writer Clare Boothe Luce in 1964, is told and retold. She is around us, reproduced, reinterpreted, reborn. She is featured in films, fashion spreads, advertising, novels, poetry, opera, video games and plays. And soon, she will be celebrated in a major exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, to mark what would have been her 100th birthday.

It's no surprise that because Marilyn's life was cut short, we will always want to imagine the possibilities for the time she had left. She inspires, she arouses, she transfixes, she mesmerises, she brings us together, she divides us: aspects of her biography still fuel heated debates. Above all, she continues to make us feel.

Towards the end of his life, director John Huston was asked about Marilyn's continuing appeal. Why did interest in her endure? What did this mean, both for him and for the public? He paused and then replied, “Well, simply that she's still alive.”

            The Commission of Fine Arts fast-tracked approval for President Donald Trump's East Wing renovation plans Thursday, bringing the president's quest for a new ballroom one step closer to reality.
    


            In a unusual move, the committee, an independent federal agency that advises the president and Congress on design plans for monuments, memorials, coins and federal buildings, voted unanimously not only to approve the concept as presented but to approve the final design, an unexpected acceleration of the approval process through this committee.
    


            The approval came despite the committee's chair noting the panel received over 2,000 public comments about the project, with over 99% negative.
    


            The meeting, held virtually on Zoom, was not open to public, in-person comment, so the chairman summarized that much of the  concern was about what commenters felt was “illegal demolition,” “inappropriate scale” and lack of transparency around the project.
    


            The vote came just an hour after the committee swore in two new members: Trump's executive assistant, Chamberlain Harris — a 26-year-old without any extensive arts experience — and Pamela Hughes Patenaude, former deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration.
    


            The addition of the new members meant the meeting was the first held with a panel made up completely of Trump appointees.
    


            Since last year, the president has been installing loyalists on the committee, after gutting the board completely in October as the East Wing demolition got underway.
    


            Newly installed commissioner Harris spoke in support of the project, saying the White House is the “greatest house in world. We want this to be the greatest ballroom in the world.”
    


            The architect of the project, Shalom Baranes, presented animated and 3-D models of the new East Wing, marking the first time the public has seen and been able to review a more complete mock-up of the project.
    


            The East Wing renovation project also requires approval from the National Capital Planning Commission that is set to meet next on March 5. The commission is also comprised of Trump loyalists.

RFK Jr ally Jay Bhattacharya was named acting director of the CDC and will be fourth leader in a year to head agency

Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was named the acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday, making him the fourth leader in a year at the embattled agency in an unprecedented move that further consolidates power among a small group of men at the helm of US health agencies.

He's been an ineffectual health leader whose attention will be further fractured, and as a close ally to Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and a longtime vaccine critic. Bhattacharya may sign off on further changes to the vaccine schedule, observers said.

Bhattacharya will continue serving in his current role as NIH director, where he has overseen dramatic cuts to research and staff. The CDC has similarly slashed grants to states and enacted massive layoffs even as officials under Kennedy have dramatically reshaped policy on routine vaccinations.

Staff say the controversial health economist has had little to do with the daily operations of the NIH.

“He won't actually run the CDC. Just as he doesn't actually run NIH,” said Jenna Norton, an NIH program officer speaking in her personal capacity.

Jeremy Berg, former director of National Institute of General Medical Sciences, had a similar response. “Now, rather than largely ignoring the actual operations of one agency, he can largely ignore the actual operations of two,” he said.

Bhattacharya, who made a name opposing measures to prevent Covid-19, has strongly criticized officials who fund research and advise on policy simultaneously.

“Bureaucrats who fund the careers of scientists should play no role whatsoever in setting pandemic policy,” Bhattacharya wrote in a post on Twitter/X in December 2021, saying the “dual role” was a conflict of interest that silenced scientists.

“It is a deep conflict of interest to have scientific funders like Fauci also closely involved with health policy,” he said in a May 2022 post criticizing Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He has also taken repeated aim at Francis Collins, a former NIH director.

Mallory Harris, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Maryland who has followed Bhattacharya's public statements closely, noted that “ironically, since becoming NIH director he has been unusually involved in setting vaccine recommendations already and is now further consolidating his own power by taking on these roles simultaneously.

“It seems the one qualification for this job is rubber-stamping RFK Jr's agenda. He has already proven himself very capable of doing so.”

The HHS did not respond by press time to the Guardian's questions about how long Bhattacharya would serve as acting director and whether he would be able to lead two large agencies simultaneously.

NIH staff say Bhattacharya delegates most of his responsibilities to his principal deputy, Matthew Memoli, and spends much of his time on media appearances, earning the moniker “Podcast Jay”.

“My first reaction was: ‘I wonder if Jay will now do twice as many podcasts,'” Norton said. But his appointment as acting director could have lasting consequences, she added. Bhattacharya has been hands-off as NIH's leader, which “allows the administration to advance their agenda while having a figurehead that appears legitimate, at least on paper”, Norton said. “Bhattacharya's role for the administration is largely as a propagandist.”

Congress passed a law in 2023 to make the CDC director a Senate-confirmable position. But the only CDC director confirmed by the Senate under Trump, Susan Monarez, was fired from the agency after four weeks last summer after Kennedy put pressure on her to “rubber-stamp” new decisions on vaccines, she said.

Most recently, Jim O'Neill served as acting director of CDC and deputy secretary at HHS before departing the health agencies on Friday; he was named director of the National Science Foundation on Wednesday.

Bhattacharya, too, is acting director, which means the position is temporary. He can serve as “acting director” until 210 days have passed since Monarez left the job.

“After that, he can no longer use the title, but could carry out the nonexclusive duties of the job through delegation,” said Anne Joseph O'Connell, a professor at Stanford Law School.

Bhattacharya was confirmed by the Senate in March 2025 to run the NIH, which means he's qualified to act as acting director of the agency, unlike one previous official tapped by Kennedy.

Experts are concerned that Bhattacharya, who has been closely aligned with Kennedy's agenda, will advance new restrictions on vaccination, for instance.

“They needed someone confirmed by the Senate who won't interfere,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at University of California Law San Francisco.

Berg said: “Under normal circumstances, one would have thought that being NIH director was more than a full-time job, and then being an acting director of CDC would be another full-time job.” But he offered little confidence in Bhattacharya's ability to manage either.

“I think he's safely locked up the position of worst NIH director in history. The agency has lost people and is barely functioning,” Berg said.

Although the White House ended up implementing a plan co-proposed by Bhattacharya, which became known as “herd immunity”, in response to the pandemic, Bhattacharya remains focused on perceived failures of the Covid response from years ago.

“He's absolutely obsessed with Covid and the pandemic response,” Berg said. He expects Bhattacharya to continue “relitigating the CDC's role in the Covid response” during his tenure. He also regularly criticized former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, saying she “epitomized politicized science”.

When Bhattacharya was first appointed, Berg thought he seemed sincere in his desire to lead the massive agency, which is a leading research organization globally. Berg emailed Bhattacharya what he hoped was helpful advice on keeping grants on track. But he was shocked when the economist responded to an email calling previous grants “ideological boondoggles”, according to emails shared by Berg.

“I moved from thinking: ‘I need to help this poor guy because he's got a huge amount on his plate,' to: ‘I don't think he's interested in knowing anything,'” Berg said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Eight skiers were found dead, six were rescued and one is still missing after avalanche in Sierra Nevada mountains 

The many weeks of a worrying snow drought in the western US is driven by the climate crisis and helped set the stage for the deadly avalanche this week in the Sierra Nevada mountains of northern California, according to experts.

Perilous avalanches are not uncommon in the region, according to the National Avalanche Center, which maintains a map of locations where avalanche danger is highest, and the risk is now particularly high in the Lake Tahoe area.

The death toll of eight backcountry skiers so far in Tuesday's avalanche makes it among the deadliest in US history. One skier is still unaccounted for while six others were rescued after being stranded for some time. The avalanche now ranks as the deadliest single such event in the US in 45 years.

The avalanche risk had become severe after several feet of new snow fell since Sunday, when the ski group started its trip, settling on top of an earlier layer that had hardened, making it unstable and easily triggered.

The new snow did not have time to bond to the earlier layer before the avalanche came down, according to Craig Clements, a meteorology professor at San Jose State University in northern California.

When weather is dry and clear, as it had been in the Sierra Nevada since January, snow crystals change and can become angular or round over time, Clements said. Heavy new snow is different and doesn't bond to the snowpack, forming something known as a “storm slab” over the weaker layer of snow.

“Because it's on a mountain, it will slide” when it's triggered by any change in the tension above or below, sometimes naturally, but also because of people traversing through the area, Clements said.

Authorities have not said what triggered Tuesday's avalanche.

If there had been more consistent snowfall throughout the winter, different layers could have bonded more easily, Clements said. But even when a snow slab forms, the danger often only lasts a couple of days until the new snow stabilizes, he said.

The climate crisis can lead to weather extremes that include both drought and heavier precipitation. Clements said he did not believe this individual avalanche can be directly linked to the climate crisis, and it was “a meteorological phenomenon, not a climate phenomenon”.

However, the record-low snowpack out west this season is mostly due to how warm the region has been, which is connected to the climate crisis from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, several scientists said.

Since 1 December, there have been more than 8,500 daily high temperature records broken or tied in the US west, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) data.

Much of the precipitation that would normally fall as snow and stay in the mountains for months is instead falling as rain, which runs off more quickly, Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California's Water Resources Institute, said.

It's a problem scientists have warned about with the climate crisis.

“It was so warm, especially in December, that the snow was only falling at the highest parts of the mountains. And then we moved into January and it got really dry almost everywhere for the last three to four weeks and stayed warm,” Daniel McEvoy, a researcher with the Western Regional Climate Center, said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated on Feb. 18 that Ukraine will not cede territory to Russia or withdraw from land it currently controls, as U.S.-brokered talks aimed at ending Russia's full-scale invasion remain deadlocked over territory ahead of the war's fourth anniversary.

""Thousands, dozens of thousands of Ukrainians have been killed on this direction, defending this part of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said in an interview with British broadcaster Piers Morgan. ""We have to understand that Donbas is a part of our independence. It's a part of our values. It's not about the land. It's not only about territories. It's about people."" 

Zelensky said negotiators have made more progress on technical discussions about how a potential ceasefire could be monitored than on political issues, while emphasizing that any durable settlement would require strong security guarantees and European involvement.

""When we speak about security guarantees, we mean strong guarantees that the rest of the world — or some countries — will be ready to respond if or when Putin returns with his aggression,"" Zelensky said. 

Zelensky described Ukrainians as exhausted after nearly four years of all-out war but said the country remains united, pointing to nationwide mobilization during winter energy attacks and rapid repair work in Kyiv and other cities.

""The most difficult situation was in Kyiv after all these energy attacks,"" Zelensky said, adding that ""240 brigades… came to (restore critical infrastructure) in Kyiv from all their regions.""

On the diplomatic track, Zelensky said the military and technical group discussions were closer to producing a detailed framework for a ceasefire monitoring mission, but he acknowledged that the political track remains contentious — especially on territory. 

Talks in Geneva ended after two days of meetings that Russian negotiators described as ""difficult but practical,"" while Zelensky said progress was insufficient and that the sides remain far apart on the political dimension. The next meeting will also take place in Switzerland, according to the president. 

Zelensky stressed that Ukraine cannot accept Russia's reported demand that Kyiv pull its forces from the remaining parts of Donetsk Oblast under Ukrainian control, calling any such proposal “unbelievable” and stressing that Ukraine does not recognize Russia's occupation as legitimate. Reuters reported earlier this week that Zelensky warned Ukraine is too often asked — rather than Russia — to make concessions, as negotiations focus on freezing the current front line and other proposals.

Asked about dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelensky dismissed the idea of personal trust and said Ukraine needs ""institutional"" security guarantees. 

Zelensky also addressed domestic and political pressure around elections, saying Ukraine's laws do not allow national elections during wartime, but adding that he would consider pushing parliament to change the law if a two-month ceasefire were secured — while cautioning that a short pause would not necessarily end the war.

""I will do my best, I will speak with Parliament. They will change the law... I hope so,"" Zelensky added. 

In the same interview, Zelensky condemned what he called ""double standards"" in international sport, referencing Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych's disqualification at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics for a ""helmet of memory"" honoring Ukrainian athletes killed in the war. Zelensky later awarded him Ukraine's Order of Freedom. 

He also criticized the International Paralympic Committee decision allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under their own flags at next month's Paralympics, calling the move ""dirty"" and ""awful.""

The reported move would limit Kyiv's role at a key gathering of NATO leaders.

Russian forces are using LTE mobile networks and Ukrainian SIM cards to remotely control FPV drones, Serhii Beskrestnov, adviser to Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, said. 

Iranian Rear Admiral Hassan Maqsoudlou said the drills reflect both countries' focus on the regional situation.

Russia launched 37 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said, of which Ukrainian air defenses intercepted or jammed 29.

Moldovan authorities said investigative measures began at 6 a.m. local time.

Ukraine reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia's Pskov Oblast and launched missiles at the Russian city of Belgorod, causing power outages in parts of the city, Telegram news channels and local authorities reported overnight Feb. 18-19.



The reported number includes 830 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol arrives at a court in Seoul on July 9, 2025.Kim Hong-Ji/The Associated Press

A South Korean court on Thursday sentenced former president Yoon Suk Yeol to life in prison over his December, 2024, imposition of martial law, which judges deemed an insurrection aimed at overthrowing the country's constitutional order.

A conservative former prosecutor, Mr. Yoon declared military rule after opposition lawmakers used their parliamentary majority to repeatedly block his agenda and launch corruption investigations into Mr. Yoon and his wife.

Late in the evening on Dec. 3, 2024, Mr. Yoon ordered troops to the National Assembly to arrest those he called “shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces, who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens.” 

But communication delays and confusion in the chain of command gave both opposition lawmakers and those in Mr. Yoon's own party enough time to call a vote in the Assembly. They unanimously overturned the president's edict, ending martial law just six hours after it was declared. 

Less than two weeks later, lawmakers voted to impeach Mr. Yoon. Last April, that measure was approved by South Korea's Constitutional Court, setting the stage for a snap presidential election that Mr. Yoon's nemesis, former opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, won handily.

Since then, prosecutors have pursued numerous charges against Mr. Yoon and other top officials involved in his attempted coup. In January, Mr. Yoon's prime minister, Han Duck-soo, was found guilty of insurrection and sentenced to 23 years in prison. Ahead of Thursday's verdict, Mr. Yoon, too, had already received a five-year sentence for obstructing investigations into the martial law decree.

Yoon's lawyers said that the Seoul court ignored the principle of basing findings on evidence.

Cho Eun-suk, a special prosecutor in Mr. Yoon's case, had called for him to face the death penalty, but the court rejected this and instead sentenced the 65-year-old to life in prison.

The panel of three judges said while the imposition of martial law is permissible under the constitution, and did not amount to an insurrection in and of itself, it was clear Mr. Yoon had sought – unsuccessfully – to block the National Assembly from exercising its oversight, ordering the barricading of the building and arrest of key lawmakers.

“It is difficult to deny that former President Yoon aimed to make the National Assembly unable to function properly for a considerable period,” lead judge Jee Kui-youn said during proceedings Thursday, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.

“Yoon planned the crime personally and in a leading role and involved many people in the crime. The emergency martial law incurred an enormous social cost, and the defendant hardly expressed an apology for that.”

Indeed, Mr. Yoon initially defied calls for him to resign or submit to investigations, rallying right-wing supporters around him and barricading himself in his residence against police.

His conviction Thursday is sure to further inflame hardline conservatives in South Korea, some of whom have adopted Mr. Yoon as an almost martyr-like figure. They accuse President Lee – who enjoys high approval with the general public – of being a leftist authoritarian and an agent of North Korea, charges that are often laid by the right against liberal South Korean politicians.

Mr. Yoon's impeachment and imprisonment echo that of former conservative president Park Geun-hye, who was removed from office in late 2016 over a sprawling corruption scandal. He also joins the list of South Korean leaders jailed for various reasons after leaving office. That list includes Ms. Park's predecessor, fellow conservative Lee Myung-bak, who was sentenced to 15 years for bribery in 2018, but received a pardon from Mr. Yoon in 2022.

According to Yonhap, the courtroom that hosted Thursday's proceedings was the same one where former president Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced to death in 1996 for his role in a 1979 coup and subsequent violent suppression of a pro-democracy movement. His sentence was later commuted to life in prison, before he was pardoned in 1997.

In a statement, Amnesty International, which had strongly criticized prosecutors' decision to request the death penalty, said Mr. Yoon's conviction was an “important step towards accountability which demonstrates that no one is above the law.”

“South Korea's independent courts and citizen resistance have shown how the rule of law and strong institutional checks can effectively counter authoritarian practices,” said Amnesty's deputy regional director Sarah Brooks.

Ahead of Thursday's verdict, President Lee, who livestreamed himself in 2024 climbing over the walls of the National Assembly to vote down martial law, responded to calls for those who helped stop the insurrection to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Their resistance, he wrote on social media, “will serve as a model for human history,” adding, “this was possible because it was the Republic of Korea.”

The latest round of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program has ended without a breakthrough — and the threat of US military action looms large. The ball seems to be back in Iran's court.

A second round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States in Geneva on Monday ended without concrete results.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and a team of technical experts met with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — but both sides had little to show for it after over three hours of talks at the Omani embassy.

Afterwards, Araghchi said the meeting was ""more constructive"" than the previous round held earlier this month.

""Good progress was made compared to the previous meeting, and we now have a clearer path ahead,"" Araghchi told Iranian state-run television.

Araghchi added that ""a set of guiding principles"" had been reached, but did not share further details.

""This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,"" he said.

US-Iran talks mediated by Oman were launched on February 6, but it is currently unclear if another round is on the horizon. Before Monday's talks, Iran's Foreign Ministry said Araghchi is prepared to stay in Geneva as long as it takes to reach a result.

""Optimism in negotiations is usually part of political rhetoric and also accompanied earlier rounds of talks,"" political scientist Mohammad Ghaedi at George Washington University told DW.

""The core conflict between the two sides remains,"" he said, adding that Iran's uranium enrichment is a ""red line"" for Washington.

""Tehran, on the other hand, does not want to give up enrichment. As long as the centrifuges are running, Iran retains the option of nuclear deterrence. If the centrifuges stop running, the country loses this deterrence,"" Ghaedi added.

At the same time, Tehran has signaled its willingness to limit its nuclear program and transfer its 60% enriched uranium to a third country. Any agreement where the US accepts continued uranium enrichment would be seen as a major concession in Tehran.

The Iranian regime insists its nuclear development is for civilian use, and denies it is trying to produce nuclear weapons. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in late 2024 warned that Iran's uranium enrichment was approaching weapons-grade level, and was already far higher than that needed for peacetime purposes.

The Islamic Republic is demanding the lifting of sanctions in return for limiting its uranium enrichment, a step that the US has so far rejected.

""Tehran is more willing to accept a military conflict than to completely abandon uranium enrichment,"" said Ghaedi.

The Iranian leadership has repeatedly ruled out negotiating other sticking points such as missile programs or their support for regional militant proxies.

One day before the latest round of negotiations, Iran's Araghchi met with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi.

Relations between Tehran and the IAEA deteriorated following the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities last year. Iran has subsequently restricted access for international inspectors.

On February 15, however, Iran's National Security chief Ali Larijani told Al Jazeera that the IAEA ""can monitor all Iranian facilities. We accept the controls under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.""

Larijani added it would be unrealistic to expect a country that had mastered the technical knowhow to completely give up uranium enrichment. He pointed to the need for uranium for civilian purposes, including cancer treatment. In Tehran, a research reactor still produces cancer medication using uranium enriched to 20%.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei renewed his threats against the US on Tuesday, claiming President Trump will fail in his ""attempt to overthrow"" the Islamic leadership in Tehran.

Trump has previously said that ""regime change"" in Tehran might be the best thing that could happen to Iran.

His comments follow the brutal suppression of nationwide protests in Iran.

Over the weekend, around 1 million Iranians in the diaspora gathered in cities around the world to demonstrate for regime change, with some calling for the return of exiled opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah who was overthrown in 1979.     

Under pressure from various sides, the regime in Tehran is attempting to demonstrate its military strength.

On Tuesday, the Revolutionary Guard Navy began maneuvers and, according to its own statements, fired missiles at targets in the Strait of Hormuz. Speedboats equipped with rocket launchers were also involved in the exercise.

The strait, which is approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) wide, is considered one of the world's most important shipping routes for global oil exports. Iranian officers have repeatedly threatened a blockade during previous tensions with the US.

The US has ""a lot of options"" when it comes to dealing with Iran, US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Tuesday evening.

He accused the government in Tehran of failing to recognize the ""red lines"" set by Trump, adding that the US president had numerous tools at his disposal to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear bomb.

Vance also repeated the accusations that Tehran is trying to build a nuclear weapon.

In recent weeks, the US has increased its military presence in the region, sending two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Arabian Sea.

Oil wells in the region are vulnerable to attacks from Iran. If Washington decides to intervene, observers warn that the escalation could drive up oil prices inside the US as the country prepares for the midterm elections, and potentially harm Trump's Republican party.

""Furthermore, the death of even a single US soldier in such a conflict would have considerable political costs,"" political scientist Ghaedi said. 

""The decision to go to war lies in the hands of the US. How long a conflict would last is beyond its control and carries high risks. This circumstance is likely to have a significant influence on President Trump's decision-making,"" he added.

US government circles have reported that many details remain unresolved despite the progress being made in Geneva. The ball seems to be back in Tehran's court.

The Iranian side wants to ""come back with detailed proposals in the next two weeks to clarify some of the outstanding differences,"" Germany's DPA news agency quoted a senior US official as saying.

Trump suggested he would make a decision in the next 10 days in remarks at the Board of Peace event Thursday.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

The U.S. is rapidly building up its military force in the Middle East, amassing an amount of air power reminiscent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as President Donald Trump mulls attacks on Iran without seeking congressional approval.

Top administration officials reported that the White House has been told that the U.S. is ready to strike Iran as soon as this weekend, CBS News reports, with other news outlets confirming. 

On Thursday, at opening remarks for his “Board of Peace” event, Trump said that “you're going to be finding out probably over the next 10 days” whether the U.S. will attack Iran. He once again threatened Iran to negotiate a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, or else “bad things will happen.”

Reports find that the military is, indeed, prepared for a significant operation. Air and sea trackers have shown an enormous amount of firepower being amassed in the region, with the Wall Street Journal comparing the amount of air power concentrated there to the build-up before the 2003 Iraq invasion.

Trump has not yet made the final decision on whether to strike, outlets have reported. Israel, which has long urged the U.S. to initiate war with Iran, may participate in potential attacks.

Trump does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally launch a war with Iran. Representatives Ro Khanna (D-California) and Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) have said that they are planning to force a vote on a War Powers Resolution next week in hopes of preventing strikes.

“Like the votes before the Iraq war, this could be one of the most consequential votes in the history of Congress. Are we going to stop another endless dumb foreign war? Or will the neoconservatives mislead us once again?” said Khanna on social media.

Polling has shown that a war or other military action against Iran is unpopular. In January, Quinnipiac found that only 18 percent of U.S. voters support taking military action against Iran if the government continued killing protesters. Shortly after last year's strikes, 85 percent of people said in a YouGov poll that they opposed war with Iran.

Trump is demanding that Iran end all domestic uranium enrichment, seemingly making demands for a new nuclear deal despite having withdrawn from one during his first term in office. 

It's unclear what or whom the strikes would target. Though he has emphasized Iran's uranium enrichment in recent remarks, just weeks ago he was threatening Iran over its violent repression of protesters. Further, the administration has maintained that the U.S. already “totally obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities,” as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday, during the Israeli and U.S. strikes last June that killed over 1,000 people.

“The president has always been very clear, though, with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option, and Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with this administration,” Leavitt said.

It is illegal under international law to use the threat of force for diplomatic ends.

On Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with Fox News after a round of indirect talks in Geneva that “​​it was very clear that the president has set some red lines  that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.”

Iran has threatened to retaliate if the U.S. launched unprovoked strikes by targetingU.S. warships. In a post on X on Tuesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: “The U.S. President keeps saying that they have the strongest military force in the world. The strongest military force in the world may at times be struck so hard that it cannot get up again.”

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an authoritarian assault on communities in Minnesota and across the nation.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a panel made up of President Donald Trump's appointees, on Thursday approved his proposal to build a ballroom larger than the White House itself where the East Wing once stood. 

The seven-member panel is one of two federal agencies that must approve Trump's plans for the ballroom. The National Capital Planning Commission, which has jurisdiction over construction and major renovation to government buildings in the region, is also reviewing the project. 

Members of the fine arts commission originally had been scheduled to discuss and vote on the design after a follow-up presentation by the architect, and had planned to vote on final approval at next month's meeting. But after the 6-0 vote on the design, the panel's chairman, Rodney Mims Cook Jr., unexpectedly made another motion to vote on final approval.

Six of the seven commissioners — all appointed by the Republican president in January — voted once more in favor. Commissioner James McCrery did not participate in the discussion or the votes because he was the initial architect on the project before Trump replaced him. 

The ballroom will be built on the site of the former East Wing, which Trump had demolished in October with little public notice. That drew an outcry from lawmakers, historians and preservationists who argued that the president should not have taken that step until the two federal agencies and Congress had reviewed and approved the project, and the public had a chance to provide comment. 




The 90,000-square-foot ballroom would be nearly twice the size of the White House, which is 55,000-square-feet, and would accommodate about 1,000 people, Trump has said. The East Room, currently the largest room in the White House, can fit just over 200 people at most.

Commissioners offered mostly complimentary comments before the votes. 

Cook echoed one of Trump's main arguments for adding a larger entertaining space to the White House: It would end the long-standing practice of erecting temporary structures on the South Lawn that Trump describes as tents to host visiting dignitaries for state dinners and other functions. 

“Our sitting president has actually designed a very beautiful structure,” Cook said. “The United States just should not be entertaining the world in tents.” 

Members of the public were asked to submit written comment by a Wednesday afternoon deadline. Thomas Leubke, the panel's secretary, said “over 99%” of the more than 2,000 messages it received in the past week from around the country were in opposition to the project.

Leubke tried to summarize the comments for the commissioners.

Some comments cited concerns about Trump's decision to unilaterally tear down the East Wing, as well as the lack of transparency about who is paying for the ballroom or how contracts were awarded, Leubke said. Comments in support referenced concerns for the image of the United States on the world stage and the need for a larger entertaining space at the White House.

Trump has defended the ballroom in a recent series of social media posts that included drawings of the building. He said in one January post that most of the material needed to build it had been ordered “and there is no practical or reasonable way to go back. IT IS TOO LATE!” 

The commission met Thursday over Zoom and heard from Shalom Baranes, the lead architect, and Rick Parisi, the landscape architect. Both described a series of images and sketches of the ballroom and the grounds as they would appear after the project is completed. 

Trump has said the ballroom would cost about $400 million and be paid for with private donations. To date, the White House has only released an incomplete list of donors. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction. A ruling in the case is pending. 

In comments it submitted to the commission, the privately funded group recommended that the size of the ballroom be reduced to “accommodate and respect the primary historic importance of the original Executive Residence.” 

At the commission's January meeting, some commissioners had questioned Baranes, Trump's architect, about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed Trump's vision. On Thursday, Baranes described changes he has since made to the design, and the commissioners said they welcomed the adjustments. 

The ballroom project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by a top White House aide. This panel heard an initial presentation about the project in January.

LONDON (AP) — He was reportedly his mother Queen Elizabeth II's favorite, but the former Prince Andrew has long been a headache for Britain's royal family.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested Thursday, his 66th birthday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office in an inquiry stemming from his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. He is the first senior British royal to be arrested since King Charles I, almost 400 years ago.

Born a prince in 1960, Andrew is the third child and second son of the queen and her husband Prince Philip. His elder brother Charles was destined for the throne. Andrew took a tried-and-tested route for younger royal sons: military service.

After 22 years in the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands War, Andrew was named Britain's special representative for international trade and investment in 2001. His frequent taxpayer-funded travel saw him dubbed “Air Miles Andy” by the press.

The current police investigation stems from that period. It follows documents in recently released Epstein files that suggest Andrew passed on official government documents to the late financier when he was a trade envoy. The former prince has not been charged with a crime. He has long denied any wrongdoing over his Epstein links.

Once a subject of media fascination for his love life, the man the tabloids dubbed “Randy Andy” became a regular source of headlines because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender.

The then-prince's business associations were the subject of tabloid stories stretching back to at least 2007, when he sold his house near Windsor Castle for 20% over the 15 million pound asking price. The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of then-Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain.




Mountbatten-Windsor was forced to step down from the trade role in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein, who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.

In 2015, U.S. court documents contained allegations that Andrew had sex with a woman three times between 1999 and 2002 in London, New York and on Epstein's private Caribbean island, including when she was a minor under U.S. law. He denied having ever met the woman, later identified as Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

After Epstein was arrested again in 2019, Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC's Newsnight program, in which he tried to explain away his contacts with Epstein. It backfired — he was widely criticized for giving unbelievable explanations and failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims.

Amid the backlash, Andrew announced on Nov. 20, 2019, that he was giving up public duties and charity roles “for the foreseeable future.”

In August 2021, Giuffre sued Andrew in a New York court, alleging that the prince had sex with her when she was 17. Andrew continued to deny the allegations, but he was stripped of all military affiliations and royal charity work.

Andrew ultimately settled the case for an undisclosed sum. While he didn't admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre's suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. Giuffre died by suicide in April 2025, aged 41.

In 2024, a court case revealed Andrew's relationship with a businessman and suspected Chinese spy  who was barred from the United Kingdom as a threat to national security. Authorities were concerned that the man could have misused his influence over Andrew, according to court documents.

After emails emerged showing Andrew remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously claimed and Giuffre's posthumous memoir brought new allegations, King Charles III in October stripped his brother of his titles of prince and Duke of York and evicted him from his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor.

The release of millions of pages of Epstein files by the U.S. Department of Justice last month sparked new scrutiny. 

Now Andrew is in police custody. Despite being stripped of his title, he remains eighth in line to the British throne. A law would have to be passed to remove him from the line of succession.

He married Sarah Ferguson in 1986 and they had two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, before divorcing a decade later. Ferguson also is facing questions about her friendship with Epstein.

Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo discusses the response to the sewage spill in the Potomac River, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and more on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a disaster emergency over the Potomac sewage spill on Wednesday and requested federal assistance with the cleanup.

The sewage spill has now become the largest in U.S. history, dumping over 240 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River. President Donald Trump has already lashed out at Maryland Gov. Wes Moore for his handling of the spill, saying he is concerned the river winding around the nation's capital will still stink when America250 celebrations kick off this summer.

Bowser wrote a letter to Trump on Wednesday formally requesting that he issue an emergency disaster declaration, freeing up federal resources to help deal with the spill.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized Trump's concerns in a press conference on Wednesday. Fox News' Peter Doocy asked Leavitt if Trump is concerned the nation's capital will ""smell like poop.""

""Yeah, he is worried about that,"" Leavitt said. ""Which is why the federal government wants to fix it. And we hope that the local authorities will cooperate with us in doing so.""

Leavitt called on leaders in Maryland, Virginia and D.C. to ""step forward and to ask the federal government for help and to ask for the Stafford Act to be implemented here so that the federal government can go and take control of this local infrastructure that has been abandoned and neglected by Gov. Moore in Maryland for far too long.""

""It's no secret that Maryland's water and infrastructure have been in dire need of repair,"" Leavitt said. ""Their infrastructure has received a nearly failing grade in the 2025 report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers. This is the same grade they've received, five years earlier. There has been no improvement under the leadership of Gov. Moore. He's clearly shown he's incapable of fixing this problem, which is why President Trump and the federal government are standing by to step in.""

Moore's office has pushed back on the administration's rhetoric surrounding the leak, claiming the federal government has oversight over DC Water, the District's water and sewer utility. 

""Since the last century, the federal government has been responsible for the Potomac Interceptor, which is the origin of the sewage leak. For the last four weeks, the Trump Administration has failed to act, shirking its responsibility and putting people's health at risk,"" a representative from Moore's office said on Monday. ""Notably, the president's own EPA explicitly refused to participate in the major legislative hearing about the cleanup last Friday.""

Leavitt continued Wednesday that environmentalists should ""pray"" that local jurisdictions call on Trump to step in and shore up infrastructure and carry out cleanup.

""For all of the environmentalists in the room and across the District of Columbia, let's all hope and pray that this governor does the right thing and ask President Trump to get involved, because it will be an ecological and environmental disaster if the federal government does not step in to help,"" she said. ""But of course, we need the state and local jurisdictions to make that formal request.""

The efforts to whitewash history call for a new approach to memorializing Black history.

This week brought another round in President Trump's war against Black history. A federal judge rebuked his administration for removing panels that mentioned “the dirty business of slavery” from the President's House in Philadelphia, where George Washington lived. (Among other inconvenient facts, the ruling reminded the public that the nation's first president rotated his slaves between his homes to duck state emancipation laws.) Judge Cynthia Rufe opened her ruling with a quote from George Orwell, and wrote that an agency “cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership.” All in all, a robust defense of accuracy. But the administration is still fighting the facts of Black history on many fronts.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to our staff writer Clint Smith, the author of How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America, about what's unprecedented in this administration's approach to whitewashing history. The Atlantic staffer Adam Harris makes the case for a different approach to Black History Month. They both also talk about the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, who died this week.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Over the many years of raising kids in D.C. public schools, I've experienced Black History Month the way many Americans do. I've helped my kids make poster boards, and as they got older, PowerPoints, celebrating the achievements of many famous Black Americans: Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks.

Black History Month celebrations tend to follow what The Atlantic's Adam Harris calls a “formula.” But this year might call for something more radical.

[Music]

President Donald Trump: (Applause.) And our country will be woke no longer. (Cheers and applause.)

Rosin: I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Here is a missive from the president that typifies his attitude about Black history: “The Smithsonian is,” all caps, “OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” he posted over the summer.

The president has restored Confederate names to Army bases, and removed lessons and images about slavery from federally funded institutions.

News anchor (from CBS Philadelphia): Well, the fight to restore a slavery exhibit in Philadelphia, it is ramping up after it was dismantled last week—

Rosin: Just this week, a federal judge ordered the administration to restore panels at what's known as the President's House in Philadelphia that discussed The Dirty Business of Slavery.

The federal judge wrote, “An agency … cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership.”

Today, we talk to two of my Atlantic colleagues: writer and podcast host Adam Harris and staff writer Clint Smith, who's also the author of How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America.

Rosin: Adam, welcome to the show.

Adam Harris: Thanks so much for having me.

Rosin: Clint, welcome to the show.

Clint Smith: It's great to be here.

Rosin: So, Clint, as someone who has studied the presentation of history, and specifically Black history, how would you characterize this administration's approach?

Smith: Antagonistic. I think we are witnessing an administration working with an unsettling intensity to attempt to distort, erase, manipulate the history of this country and, within that, manipulate the history of Black Americans' role, contributions, and experiences in America. And what I mean by that is—let's take slavery, for example. The president of the United States said that the Smithsonian [Institution], for example, spends too much time talking about “how bad Slavery was.”

My sense of things is that it is not the case that this administration believes slavery didn't happen or not even that they believe that slavery wasn't bad. I think they understand that it was bad, but what happens is, if you talk honestly about the horror and the brutality and the cruelty of what slavery was, you then have to talk about how the residue of that system continues to inform the contemporary landscape of inequality today.

And I think it would fundamentally reorient people's relationship to not only the history of this country, but the contemporary reality of this country. And that's something that I think that so many folks in this administration want to avoid because they want to be able to tell themselves that the America that they believe to be true, the America that exists today, is one that is the result singularly of people's hard work or deservedness when there's obviously another story to be told there.

Rosin: And what is that desire about? 'Cause, Adam, [President Donald] Trump talks about wanting monuments to be “uplifting,” not to cause people “shame.” What does that mean?

Harris: So when you think about the idea of uplifting, it's sort of this notion of celebrating the positives of someone's character, so as to say, George Washington was the founder of the nation and led the Revolution, was one of the greatest men of his time, and if you do that and you sort of say this clean history of George Washington without the additional stories, the fact that George Washington rotated his enslaved workers from Philadelphia to Mount Vernon in Virginia so that they would not earn their liberty under Pennsylvania law, because after six months, you started to get your freedom. And so if you start to add to that complicating narrative, it doesn't paint this sort of clean image of our leaders.

Rosin: And that just feels bad? What's the—

Harris: So there are a couple of things that that does. When you start to question one of the decisions, it also makes you question the other things—if you start to say, Well, this person that we've painted as someone who did an unqualified good did, also, unqualified bads.

Smith: And I think the other part of this, too, is that if you have to tell a new story about Washington and you begin to tell a new story about [Thomas] Jefferson that includes the sort of unsavory, so to speak, parts of their legacy, which is to say the more honest parts of their legacy—if you have to tell a new story about these men, it also means you have to tell a new story about America's founding. If you have to tell a new story about America's founding, it means you have to tell a new story about this country. And for many Americans, if you have to tell a new story about America, it means you have to tell a new story about yourself.

Harris: Exactly.

Smith: And that taps into something that is existential, that serves as a catalyst to a fundamental crisis of identity, because who people believe they are is consciously, and subconsciously, tied to a story of America that they have been told over the course of generations—through school, through family, through community. And when you untether them from that notion of reality that they've come to believe, it's incredibly jarring.

Rosin: Yeah, I can see. It's disorienting. I feel like we need to ground this conversation in a few examples. You started by using the word intensity. Of the things that the Trump administration has done, which one has stuck out to you? Just give us a few examples.

Harris: Yeah, there are a handful. It's the renaming of Confederate memorials and Confederate monuments. It is the U.S. Naval Academy removing books from their library. It's the Air Force Academy stripping back the teaching of the Tuskegee Airmen.

And actually, one of the things that Clint was saying about people having to reassess their own legacies, I remember we had a conversation about his book, where he was saying, If you are having to ask questions about the ways that your grandparents—the people who took you fishing, and the people who you sat on their laps and they read books to you when you were younger, and you have all of these great memories of them—if you have to reassess how they got to do the things that they got to do, then it really does jar you and makes you fundamentally reassess your own sort of standing in the world.

And so this sort of broader project of saying, Well, if we pare back some of the things that the Tuskegee Airmen had to do to become the Tuskegee Airmen—Black History Month sort of calls us to remember that these great people did great things, but the question is: Why did they have to do those great things? Why did Jackie Robinson have to integrate baseball? Why did Martin Luther King have to deliver his speech at the March on Washington? It is because the nation did not have this clean story of progress.

Rosin: Clint, I'm curious to put this in some kind of context, what the Trump administration is doing now, which you described as having a certain degree of intensity, versus previous eras in American history versus Trump 1, because there's always a push and pull. I imagine countries rarely do just clean memorialization of their sins.

Smith: Yeah. What's interesting is that this is the pushback against Black progress, Black history. That, in and of itself, is not new. What scholars of Black history and historians talk about all the time is that in moments in which there are periods of Black social, political, and economic progress, there is often pushback to that progress.

So after the Civil War and after Reconstruction, there was obviously an intense sort of pushback to the progress that was made following the Civil War through Reconstruction. Then, after the civil-rights movement, there was an intense pushback. And what we're seeing now is a pushback to much of the era both of Barack Obama's presidency, but then later, the Black Lives Matter movement, which sort of intensified following the murder of George Floyd.

But what it is important to note—that even while we are experiencing the echoes of this history and we're experiencing this sort of nature of the sort of cyclical elements that are there, this also is a pretty unique iteration of it in the way that it is state sanctioned. In the context of the civil-rights movement, there was intense pushback—or even during the civil-rights movement, so much of the pushback, it would come from states and it would come from extrajudicial forces, but what the civil-rights leaders were appealing to was the federal government to come and protect them.

Rosin: Ah, that is so important. I get that. So what you're saying is, mostly, the pushback is cultural—it's cultural; it comes from state governments. But this is completely top-down.

Smith: Oftentimes, yeah. I don't think that we have seen a level of antagonism from the federal government, who, historically, the federal government or the Supreme Court, in the context of the Warren Court, have been the thing that allowed Black folks to have some sort of support outside of the context of their specific geographic and political reality in a certain state or in a certain community. And that now is gone. There is no federal government to appeal to. In fact, the federal government is the antagonist.

[Music]

Rosin: After the break: Is it time to start practicing Black History Month differently?

[Break]

Rosin: So given everything you both have said, which is, we're in this unusual position where the federal government is a major actor in, what do we wanna call it, distorting, whitewashing history?

Harris: Both.

Rosin: Prettifying history—

Smith: All of the above.

Rosin: —any of those? It's Black History Month, which is this month. In this year, in this moment, is there an argument for thinking of or practicing Black History Month differently?

Smith: I've been thinking a lot about this. I was recently in New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and I bring my kids. I'm from New Orleans; that's my hometown. My parents still live there—

Rosin: Happy Fat Tuesday.

Smith: There you go.

I bring my kids often to New Orleans 'cause it's a place that means a lot to me and I want them to have a connection to that city. And one of the things that we did, kind of between the celebrations and the festivals and the parades, is we got in the car with my mom and went to her elementary school, which is no longer there; it's a school that was called T. J. Semmes.

And we went there because my mom was among the first Black students to desegregate that school, or to integrate that school. She was there after—there were the four little girls, including Ruby Bridges, who integrated New Orleans schools in 1960. And I brought my kids there with my mom in this moment because I've been thinking a lot about what it means for people to understand Black history not only as something about Rosa Parks and Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King, but also as this thing that's the people who are right next to us. Their grandmother—not Martin Luther King, not Rosa Parks, not these people in the books—their grandmother was among the first wave of students to integrate a school in New Orleans.

And I want them both to understand that because of their proximity to it, but also, in this specific moment, I think it's a reminder that the Trump administration can try to change a museum. They can try to change how things are taught in school. They can try to take away DEI in higher ed. They can try to do all of these things. But we still, within the sort of microunits of families and communities, still have the power to share this history in ways that I think can be really meaningful for all of us and for young people. And it wasn't just for my kids; I got to hear my mom talk about her experience going into this school.

And I think all of these things, for me, when I think of Black History Month, it's about both understanding and appreciating the sort of Jackie Robinsons and the like, but it's also about remembering that those larger figures are only possible because of what's happening on the most granular level.

Harris: And actually, to that point, it is to say that it's the actions of each individual. You think historically, it's like, oh, well, Frederick Douglass actually didn't have to write those things that he wrote, and they praised him because it was like, Oh, that was a really brave thing of you to do. Our grandparents didn't have to send our moms and dads to the schools that they sent them to. A lot of people didn't, where it's like, Actually, it's a little bit too dangerous to do that. And similarly, my mom was born in 1963 in Alabama, where four little girls were killed in a church, the sanctuary, the place where you're supposed to feel safest. This is living history that individuals experience and continue to experience, and it's the individual actions that people take.

Rosin: And why is it important to remember history in its difficulty? Even within families, people keep secrets for decades and decades, and they don't like to talk about the bad things that happen. It's a common human impulse. So why is it important to remember something like what your mother went through?

Smith: I tell people all the time: America is a place that has provided unparalleled, unimaginable opportunities for millions of people across generations in ways that their own ancestors could have never imagined. It has also done so at the direct expense of millions and millions of other people. And both of those things are the story of America—it's not one over here and one over there; you get to pick this one and not pick that one. Both of those things are the story of this country, and you have to hold both of those realities alongside one another.

Rosin: Why?

Smith: Well, I think when we think of ourselves, when I think of who I am as a person, I'm someone who's done things in my life that I'm proud of, and I'm someone who's done things in my life that I'm not proud of, because I'm human and I make mistakes. And what I try to do and what I try to teach my children is, you acknowledge those mistakes; you try to learn from those mistakes to become a better version of yourself in the future. And so if that's the standard that I hold myself to, the standard I hold my children to, the standard I hold my friends and loved ones to, why would I not hold my country to that same standard?

And I think the implications for it are that if you don't—I remember being a kid growing up in the '90s in New Orleans and being inundated with these messages about all the things that were wrong with Black people, that the reason there was so much violence and poverty and inequality in the Black community was because of something that Black people had done or had failed to do. And it was coming from the media. It was coming from politicians. It was coming from celebrities. It was coming from everywhere.

And I remember this feeling of hearing these messages and not having the historical context or intellectual tool kit with which to push back against it, and what I felt and experienced as a child was a sort of paralysis. It was like an emotional paralysis, where I knew what I was hearing was wrong, but I didn't know how to say it was wrong. I didn't have that language. And it wasn't until years later, when I encountered the scholarship, and I encountered the art, and I encountered the film and I encountered the history that explained that, oh, the reason one part of New Orleans looks one way and another part of New Orleans looks another way is not 'cause of the people in those communities. It's because of what has been done to those communities or what's been extracted from those communities generation after generation after generation. And when you learn that history, it is so profoundly freeing and so profoundly liberating because this country can't lie to you anymore.

Rosin: Adam, this week, there was a pushback against this trend we're describing from a federal judge who ruled about the panels at what's known as the President's House in Philadelphia that were taken down. It was quite a strong ruling. She quoted [George] Orwell. She said “An agency … cannot arbitrarily decide what is true.” How significant is that ruling? Have you seen other kinds of pushback like that?

Harris: We have seen federal judges push back pretty forcefully against the Trump administration's dictates, their executive orders, and maneuvers that they've made, whether that is removing the placards without consulting the city in an effort to sort of say that the history that they want to say is a true history. The order functionally says it can't just hinge on whether there's the transfer of power, what we actually believe about what we're saying. It is a very Orwellian view of the way we do history.

Americans, people generally, think of history in a different way than scholars think of history, where, yes, there are places and dates and names, but how those things are remembered is sort of subject to your interpretation, oftentimes. But there are realities. The fact that George Washington transported people back and forth and wrote to other people to say that, Hey, how can I get around this law that says that I can't keep people here for longer than this period of time?, those are just realities. You cannot change the facts of the situation. You can only change how you remember those facts and if you decide to publicly display those facts. And in a sense, what we have seen over the last year and change, in a really aggressive fashion, is that effort to remove those public memories of the facts that happen in this country.

Rosin: Although that conversation about facts does often confuse me a little bit. What we do do is decide which facts we're gonna present, which is what the Trump administration is saying: Why do we have to put those on display?

Smith: I think it goes back to what we were saying before. I was a high-school teacher, and so I feel very strongly about the idea that the Trump administration would suggest that part of why you shouldn't teach so much about Washington owning slaves or Jefferson owning enslaved people or why the presidential house should remove these things is, they would say, because they don't want so much emphasis on it. And they would say that teachers and museums are attempting to indoctrinate students—they use the language of indoctrination.

And what I find to be true is that there is this attempt to conflate, or to make it so that the teaching of empiricism, of primary-source realities, to suggest that that is somehow an ideological project rather than an empirical one. What I tried to do when I was a teacher and what I try to do as someone who writes about history is not necessarily to convince the reader to believe X or believe Y, but it is to lay out all of it.

I'm actually not interested in if you think Thomas Jefferson was evil or good. What I do want you to do is sit with the fact that he both wrote the Declaration of Independence and he also wrote in Notes on the State of Virginia that Black people are inferior to whites in both endowments of body and mind. What I want you to do is to sit with the fact that he wrote that “all men are created equal” and that he enslaved 600 people, including four of his own children. My role is not to tell you what to think, but what I do have to do is present the evidence. What a teacher does have to do is present the evidence. What a museum does have to do is present the evidence, to say, This is the totality. This is the full picture.

My understanding is that the presidential house doesn't say anywhere, George Washington was an evil man. George Washington was bad. What it says is that George Washington did X, Y, Z in the context of founding America, that he stepped down after two terms, etc., etc. And also says, And there's this other part of him: that he owned a plantation in Mount Vernon; that, as Adam said, he brought his slaves back and forth to avoid having to emancipate them. And what we, as Americans, have to do is to sit with all of that.

Rosin: As you both know, this week, Jesse Jackson died. Did you find yourself thinking differently about him as we start to hear his voice on the radio this week? 'Cause I imagine, like most people, you just haven't thought about him in a minute.

Smith: The thing that I thought about more than anything after I heard about his passing—we've been talking about what it means to have these conversations with your children and to attempt to ensure that they understand their proximity to Black history. When I told my daughter, who just turned 7, about how Jesse Jackson was with Martin Luther King when Martin Luther King was killed, it blew her mind 'cause in her mind, Martin Luther King is this guy from a long, long time ago. Like, Martin Luther King and Jesus were around at the same time.

[Rosin and Harris laugh]

Smith: To watch her little eyes be like, Oh, there was a person who was alive until just now who was with Martin Luther King, who worked with him, who was an adult with Martin Luther King when he was killed, what it did, I think, was, again, helped remind her that this history that many people say was a long time ago just, in fact, wasn't that long ago at all.

Rosin: Yeah, I was surprised in my reaction to the “I Am Somebody” speech, which I heard when I was in college. He came to my college campus. He spoke to us.

Jesse Jackson: I may be poor!

Crowd: I may be poor!

Jackson: But I am—

Crowd: I am—

Jackson: Somebody!

Crowd: Somebody!

Jackson: I may be—

Rosin: And I realized it settled in my memory almost like a song, like a rhythm: I am somebody. But just listening to the words—I am poor, I am unemployed, I am in prison—

Jackson: —I may be in jail!

Crowd: I may be in jail!

Jackson: But I am—

Crowd: But I am—

Jackson: Somebody!

Rosin: —and I am somebody—I was really moved by it. I actually listened to what he was saying, I think, probably for the first time.

Jackson: And I am—

Crowd: I am—

Jackson: Somebody!

Crowd: Somebody!

Harris: Yeah. It's this idea that history isn't so far away, that we are not living outside of history, that we really are living inside of history, and that his passing really signals that that truth continues, and it becomes incumbent on that next generation to pick up the mantle of carrying that truth forward.

Jackson: I've sought to make America better. And how do you make America better? By challenging America to be better—and to be good.

Rosin: Thank you, Adam.

Harris: Thank you so much.

Rosin: Thanks, Clint.

Smith: Thank you.

Jackson: It's dark, my friends. But don't surrender. The morning comes. I know it's dark, but the morning comes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Black History Month Is Radical Now","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/black-history-month-trump/686000/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

A nation that wants to forget its past must be reminded of all of it.

America loves its heroes. The nation has made lions of the men who signed a document 250 years ago to declare independence from the English crown; it's made saints of the 55 men who gathered in a sweaty room in Philadelphia to draft its Constitution. Time elevates those people and their deeds to the heights of deities, and American gods must be faultless. But those heroes are not gods; they were, indeed, men—fallible as all others.

In the same city where the Founders wrote the words that have guided the nation for more than two centuries, George Washington—the most esteemed of them—made a home as America's first president. He brought men and women he had enslaved with him, and rotated them between Philadelphia and Mount Vernon, in Virginia, so that they would not earn their liberty under Pennsylvania law. He shuffled them back and forth so that they would remain his property. These facts cannot be changed; only how they are remembered can.

For 16 years, an exhibit at Washington's Philadelphia home, “The President's House: Freedom and Slavery in the Making of a New Nation”—situated in the shadow of the Liberty Bell's unambiguous nod to freedom's ring—highlighted that difficult history. But in late January, a cadre of federal workers yanked placards from the site's brick walls in response to a March 2025 executive order from the White House that shunned complication. In the order, President Trump had charged the secretary of the interior with ensuring that public monuments “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”

Clint Smith: What it means to tell the truth about America

Black History Month is sometimes treated as little more than an opportunity for corporate branding and, maybe, school assemblies; but in the face of such erasure, observing it this February feels radical. Black history in America is, of course, more than the story of enslavement and what was done to Black people on this continent across hundreds of years. It is a story of family, love, resilience, determination, achievement, and, yes, despair, wrapped into one package—what Black Americans achieved in spite of the fact that, for many years, they were not seen as fully Americans. It is not a simple history and it is not a story of unrelenting progress, because America's history is neither of those things. To acknowledge the troubling, shameful aspects of American history is not to denigrate the Founders but to see them, and the others who made their livelihoods possible, as people. Black History Month calls on us to remember their humanity, and to remember the heroic and human deeds of those who have always been unsung.

This is a milestone year for America. It marks both the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the 100th anniversary of an effort to recover and recount the contributions of Black Americans left out of the national narrative—what was launched in 1926 as Negro History Week and then became Black History Month in 1976. One anniversary honors the nation's founding ideals; the other reckons with its failures to live up to them. Both offer an essential—and timely—opportunity to acknowledge the ambitions and shortcomings of America's grand and unfinished experiment.

The majority of Americans experience Black History Month as a formula. Students prepare PowerPoint or posterboard projects about people such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, or Jackie Robinson—or, for those who would venture further in our history, Phillis Wheatley, the nation's first published Black poet. Businesses invite speakers and hold events for staff. Civic associations host dinners.

That is not how Black History Month began, though. Its precursor was established by Carter G. Woodson, the historian and founder of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, at a time when eugenics—race science and the idea that white people were genetically superior to Black people—was finally being challenged as the pseudoscience it is. “The greatest scholars of today are saying that there is no such thing as race in science, and that there is nothing in anthropology or psychology to support such myths as the inferiority and superiority of races,” the 1927 announcement for Negro History Week reads. “These truths, however, will have little bearing on the uplift of the negro if they are left in the state of academic discussion.” From its inception, the event was designed to be a chance to tell the truth about the past in public—the whole truth.

In 1976, Negro History Week became Black History Month, and was officially acknowledged by President Gerald Ford. The nation, founded on “individual rights,” was turning 200—but Black Americans had only just had their right to vote reinforced by law. Every president since then has issued a proclamation to celebrate Black History Month. Freedom is a struggle, Ronald Reagan's proclamation said in 1986, echoing Frederick Douglass's exhortation that if there is no struggle, there is no progress. “The American experience and character can never be fully grasped until the knowledge of black history assumes its rightful place in our schools and our scholarship,” Reagan wrote.

Vann R. Newkirk II: American democracy is only 55 years old–and hanging by a thread

On February 3, President Trump continued that tradition, and signed a proclamation of his own for Black History Month. “From the very beginning, our country has been blessed with countless black American heroes,” he stated, before lambasting people who have “needlessly divided” the public over race. “As President, I proclaim that ‘black history' is not distinct from American history—rather, the history of Black Americans is an indispensable chapter in our grand American story.”

But what his administration is doing belies whatever nice words Trump had to say about Black heroes. Its actions to limit what aspects of Black history can be included in the American story betray Trump's real meaning. His administration has renamed monuments for Confederate traitors, scrubbed memorials to the contributions of Black military service members, and purged writings by authors such as Maya Angelou from the U.S. Naval Academy library; this is an ongoing project.

Other politicians have made a concerted effort to curtail examinations of American history over the past several years. State lawmakers have limited what can be taught in public schools. Florida passed a law that warns teachers not to “persuade students to a particular point of view,” and blocked an Advanced Placement curriculum for African American studies. Oklahoma barred “discriminatory principles,” such as the idea that people bear responsibility for what someone of their race did in the past; teachers at one school said they were told to stop saying “Black excellence” to motivate their students. The Trump administration's executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have created confusion and a climate of fear—not least because administration officials have been vague about what punishments districts, universities, and nonprofits might face for running afoul of their ideological standards and about what would even constitute a violation.

That haze has led to a drawback of even the most anodyne of celebrations honoring Black achievement. Last month, Indiana University at Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Dinner—held, without fail, every year since 1969—citing budget cuts. As a joint production of the university and its Black Student Union, the dinner was a marquee event in town. But halfway through 2025, IU closed its DEI office. State law had mandated that it shut down all DEI-adjacent programs, which meant the Black Student Union would lose a portion of its funding—funding that would have helped support the dinner.

On January 13, in response to a community outcry, the chancellor, Latha Ramchand, said the university was trying to “reimagine” its “affinity dinners” and other such events. “In short, the MLK Dinner is not going away—rather we are in a moment of transition and the work of this task force will help us create its next iteration.” But traditions gain salience through time and repetition. When they are interrupted, when we stop choosing them consistently, they lose their heft.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

At its most elemental, Black History Month is about seeing the nation in full. It invites complexity. Booker T. Washington, who created the Tuskegee Institute and built it into an academic juggernaut for Black students, was the most powerful Black man of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even his critics were forced to confess as much and admire his brilliance. Acknowledging his greatness does not mean forgetting that his philosophy would have allowed—at least in the short term—the continuation of Black Americans' second-class citizenship. “In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers,” he told a predominantly white audience at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta in 1895, “yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.”

Trump is correct that the United States is one nation with a shared history—people, places, dates, and events. But that history has been experienced differently by different people. It is a nation of the enslaved and the enslaver. It is also a nation built on principles. And one feels bad about telling the true legacy of the slaveholder only if one identifies, in some way, with his actions rather than his nobler ideals. To recognize the divide between someone's stated values and their actions is to recognize where they should have done better and where we can still do better.

On Monday, citing George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, a federal judge ordered the administration to restore the placards at Washington's old home in Philadelphia. History could not be erased. “The government here likewise asserts truth is no longer self-evident, but rather the property of the elected chief magistrate and his appointees and delegees,” Judge Cynthia Rufe, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote. “An agency, whether the Department of the Interior, NPS, or any other agency, cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership, regardless of the evidence before it.”

A day later, Jesse Jackson died at the age of 84. The civil-rights leader's two upstart presidential campaigns revealed how limited America's political imagination was at the time; his platform would become the foundation of the progressive movement for the next three decades. Sometimes I look at black-and-white photos of Jackson—playing basketball with Marvin Gaye, standing next to King on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis before he was murdered, or preparing to deliver the first joint address by a Black man to the Alabama legislature since Reconstruction. It's easy to think of Jackson in the past. But he was also human, and lived until it was no longer this world but his friend John Lewis that he would see in the morning.

In 2019, members of Congress were preparing to discuss H.R. 40, a bill that would study reparations for slavery—a bill to atone for history. I spoke with Jackson ahead of the hearing. We talked about racism, reparations, and ultimately about hope. It felt natural to wonder where someone who had seen so much bad in U.S. history continued to draw his resolve from. Jackson told me that his own hope stemmed from the fact that the truth cannot be erased. “The truth of slavery—that Africans subsidized America's wealth—that truth will not go away,” he said. History must be remembered. His death is a reminder that the duty to contend with that history falls to those who are still on this Earth.

He faces criminal penalties for allegedly leaking government secrets to Jeffrey Epstein.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

On Tuesday, November 30, 2010, at 2:57 p.m., Prince Andrew—as he then was—received details of his upcoming trips as Britain's official trade envoy: Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Vietnam, Singapore. At 3:02 p.m., he forwarded the entire email to Jeffrey Epstein.

At dawn today, that stupid and unethical decision—and many others like it—finally caught up with him. Police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on the morning of his 66th birthday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and are now searching his homes. Prosecutors have not yet released specific charges, which are thought to relate to Andrew passing on sensitive government information to Epstein. The offense carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. His brother, King Charles III, was not officially informed in advance, but had signaled that the royal family would cooperate with any police inquiry.

Charles had already stripped Andrew of his title after the latest batch of Epstein files dropped, because the newly released emails proved beyond doubt that Andrew had lied about breaking off contact with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, in 2010. The disgraced former prince had also been evicted from his lavish residence in Windsor, just outside London, where he had lived effectively rent-free for many years. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” Charles wrote in his statement on the arrest, adding: “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”

Elizabeth Bruenig: Circles of Epstein hell

In the United States, the Epstein affair is still seen primarily as a sex scandal. The financier was well known as a man who could easily find women—“no one over 25 and all very cute,” he told Elon Musk—to go on dates with his rich friends. (“Pro or civilian?” Steve Tisch, a co-owner of the New York Giants, asked about one such woman.) But here in Britain, this is a corruption scandal—and not just because Andrew sent Epstein confidential information about investment opportunities in Afghanistan. The police recently searched two addresses linked to Peter Mandelson, a former government minister and an ambassador to Washington who also lied about the extent of his friendship with Epstein.

During his time in government in the late 2000s, the files show, Mandelson forwarded market-sensitive emails to Epstein, on subjects such as the eurozone bailout of Greece, mixed in with laddish banter and discussions about how Mandelson might make money after leaving office. Mandelson has already been stripped of his seat in the House of Lords and his affiliation with the Labour Party; for a few hours, many in the press corps thought the scandal might bring down Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had bafflingly appointed Mandelson as U.S. ambassador, despite his long record of other scandals. In the end, Starmer's chief of staff, who had recommended Mandelson for the job, stepped down instead.

The allegations against Andrew date from a similar period, when he was a trade envoy for the British Foreign Office. That job turned out to involve flying around the world in high style—often to places run by oligarchs, dictators, and fellow royals, on the basis that they would be flattered to deal with a prince. Once there, he might also take the opportunity to watch, say, a Formula One race or have a few rounds of golf. Attractive young women seem to have been present at many of these events. Foreign intelligence services must have regarded Andrew's appointment in 2001 as a gift from the heavens.

Everyone knew that this stank. At the time, I worked for The Daily Mail, a right-wing tabloid, which ran near-weekly stories on the latest questionable Andrew news. In 2007, for example, he sold his white elephant of a mansion, Sunninghill, which his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, had given him as a wedding present. A Kazakh oligarch paid millions over the asking price, and then never moved in.

The problem for the royal family was that Andrew and his then-wife, Sarah—known in Britain as “Fergie,” after her unmarried name—had no discernible talents but extremely expensive tastes. The journalist Andrew Lownie's book on the couple, Entitled, recounts how Sarah used to run up room-service bills in hotels and then simply walk out. “She would just breeze out of the Four Seasons and The Palace in New York as if she was too important to pay,” one source told him. The couple separated in 1992, but Sarah continued to use her title, the Duchess of York, to boost her commercial ventures. In 1995, Buckingham Palace refused to pay off any more of her debts, and issued a statement saying that “the Duchess's financial affairs are no longer Her Majesty's concern.”

After this, despite making millions of dollars from her series of children's books, Fergie went crawling to Epstein for loans. She wrote in 2010: “Is there any chance I could borrow 50 or 100,000 US dollars to help get through the small bills that are pushing me over. . Had to ask.” The files also contain a particularly grim exchange after Fergie denounced Epstein following his conviction, only to email him in a panic afterward, assuring him she never used the “P word”—pedophile. Both she and Andrew were tethered to Epstein by their greed and entitlement. They wanted millionaire lifestyles. More than that, they felt that they deserved them. Why? Because of an accident of birth in one case, and a fortuitous marriage in the other. The couple have been divorced for three decades but have never really moved on, possibly because they are mirror images of each other.

Entitled also makes a compelling case that Andrew is—to put it delicately—boorish and dim. It's entirely possible that he never questioned why Epstein would work so assiduously to maintain their friendship. One was a good chap, wasn't one? As trade envoy, Andrew became known for practical jokes and off-color remarks, which British diplomats had to tolerate because of his titles.

Until 2022, he also benefited from the protection of his mother. Andrew was widely perceived to be the late Queen's favorite child: Charles was sensitive, unlike his parents, who had been raised as emotionally stunted aristocrats; Anne, a tougher, horse-mad child, was Prince Philip's pet; Edward, like many youngest children, benefited from his parents softening with middle age. But no one really knew what to do with Andrew, who was nicknamed “Baby Grumpling” because of his temper. Like his nephew Prince Harry, he seems to have been most secure when in the tight-knit and hierarchical world of the military. Unlike Harry, though, he frequently reminded his peers of his royal status and was unable to make real friendships with people he considered below him.

Read: What Jeffrey Epstein offered Prince Andrew

Over the years, the late Queen had repeatedly smoothed Andrew's way in life. But even she could not save him after his disastrous decision to give an interview to the BBC in 2019 about his connection with Epstein. He presented a portrait of blithe privilege, denying a deep connection with the financier by saying he had hosted him only for a “straightforward shooting weekend.” He claimed to have spent three days with Epstein in New York in 2010 for the sole purpose of breaking off their friendship. This was unbelievable at the time, and has now been debunked by the latest files. “Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!!!!” a 2011 email from Andrew declares. The revulsion at his appearance on the BBC prompted his mother to strip him of his ceremonial titles and retire him as a “working royal.”

Charles has gone even further—supported by his son Prince William. Both the king and his successor believe that Andrew's actions could destroy the royal family, and they are keen to amputate him from the Windsors and cauterize the wound. None of the statements from Buckingham Palace has carried the slightest hint that they believe Andrew has been wronged by a witch hunt. The king's last statement before today included a telling line: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse.” Private companies are said to throw employees under the bus when the reputational damage gets too great. Andrew has been thrown under the state carriage.

All this presents quite a contrast with the U.S., where the fallout from contact with Epstein has largely been restricted to second-tier names—some of whom are provably guilty only of being chummy with a sex offender, which is not itself a crime. Like Andrew, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also claimed to have broken off contact with Epstein—in his case, in 2005, after seeing Epstein's massage room in New York—but the files revealed that the association continued for many years afterward. However, Lutnick has the fortune to work for Donald Trump. The president is unlikely to request that anyone resign for being friendly with Epstein, since that would apply to him, too.

The former Prince Andrew acted as he did because he lived in a world in which someone like him never faced consequences. That isn't true anymore. “Nobody is above the law,” Starmer said in response to the news. In Britain, at least, that might actually be true.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weedkiller glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.

Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used weedkiller for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.

Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning. 

""Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,"" he said. ""We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.""

But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington. 

""Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production,"" Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. ""The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most.""

Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he ""can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.""

""Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised,"" Cook said. ""If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes.""

Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer. 

Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing ""an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods.""

Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.

""Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture,"" the House Agriculture Committee said Wednesday night in an X post. ""This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers.""

House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.

In this article

Shares of Figma traded higher on Thursday, but were well short of the initial surge following earnings.

The stock was up by as much as 15% after the bell on Wednesday, when the design software maker reported fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and offered rosy guidance.

Figma's revenue grew 40% year over year to $303.8 million during the period. It reported a net loss of $226.6 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with net income of $33.1 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company expects to report $315 million to $317 million in first-quarter revenue, which implies 38% year-over-year growth. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $292 million.

Analysts at Bank of America said Figma's fourth-quarter results were solid, and its guidance took center stage. They said all key growth drivers are ""very much in place"" at the company, but it could still face some headwinds because of broader market uncertainty.

""Figma's AI monetization timetable is certainly on track, though Figma shares could remain under pressure until a tangible revenue disclosure, given the bearish sentiment on apps generally,"" the analysts wrote in a Wednesday note.

In recent months, investors have grown worried about artificial intelligence's potential to disrupt software companies, sparking a massive sell-off in the sector. Shares of the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF are down more than 20% year to date.

Figma, which was caught up in the sell-off, has been working to build AI into its products. The company announced a partnership with the AI startup Anthropic on Tuesday.

""If you look at software, not only is it not going away, there's going to be way more of it than ever before,"" Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a Wednesday interview. 

He did note, however, that the market is ""potentially increasingly competitive.""

Analysts at Morgan Stanley said even Figma's ""best in class growth rates"" couldn't insulate shares from the ""rising tide of investor concerns around the disruptive impacts of GenAI."" 

They said the company's fourth-quarter results suggest it is a strong participant in the AI innovation cycle, and not a company at risk of disruption. 

The analysts pointed to rising usage of Figma's AI-based tooling, broadening partnerships with AI companies and competitive monetization avenues. 

""Bottom line, we come out of the Q4 print feeling better about Figma's expanding solution portfolio and positioning in an AI world, and with shares having pulled back considerably we see a much moreattractive risk/reward in the shares,"" the analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

Bitcoin trading remained volatile on Thursday, rising to around $67,000 after briefly dipping near $65,900, as traders weighed a new message from U.S. President Donald Trump claiming the nation's trade deficit has been cut by 78% thanks to tariffs and could turn positive later this year.

""The United States trade deficit has been reduced by 78% because of the tariffs being charged to other companies and countries,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post late Wednesday. ""Ot will go into positive territory during this year, for the first time in many decades.""

The claim matters for crypto less because of the math in any single post and more because it pulls the market back to a familiar pressure point.

Tariffs can act like a tax on imports, which can lift prices in the real economy and complicate the path for interest rates. When markets start pricing “rates higher for longer,” the dollar tends to firm and risk assets tend to lose oxygen. 

Bitcoin has spent the past two weeks trading like a macro proxy again, reacting to shifts in liquidity and rate expectations rather than any crypto specific catalyst.

There is also a real data backdrop that makes trade a live topic. In early January, the U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply to about $29.4 billion, the lowest since 2009, with analysts pointing to a drop in imports, a jump in exports and the knock on effects of tariff threats. 

But economists also noted that a big part of the swing came from non monetary gold flows, which can make month to month numbers look cleaner than the underlying trend.

If the tariffs story hardens into a stronger dollar and tighter financial conditions, rallies can struggle to stick. If it fades into political noise, crypto goes back to watching flows, leverage and whether buyers can reclaim lost levels.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","The Altcoin Exodus: Trading Volumes Halve As Capital Flees To Bitcoin $65,000 Fortress","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:c147aba4c094b:0-the-altcoin-exodus-trading-volumes-halve-as-capital-flees-to-bitcoin-65-000-fortress/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 07:00:00 GMT","

The altcoin market has faced persistent difficulties since 2024, with many assets still struggling to recover from the euphoric highs reached during the 2021 bull cycle. Despite intermittent rallies, broader momentum has remained weak, reflecting reduced speculative appetite, tighter liquidity conditions, and a gradual shift in investor preference toward more established crypto assets. This prolonged underperformance has left a large portion of the altcoin sector trading well below historical peaks, reinforcing cautious sentiment across the market.

A recent CryptoQuant analysis provides additional context by examining capital rotation patterns during Bitcoin's latest corrective phase. After a sharp pullback, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation range roughly between $65,000 and $72,000, an area where significant activity from whales, long-term holders, and institutional participants appears to be concentrated. Such consolidation zones often attract strategic accumulation rather than speculative altcoin exposure.

Historically, deep corrections or late-stage bear phases tend to trigger capital migration toward Bitcoin, while altcoins experience reduced inflows. Binance trading volume data — segmented into BTC, ETH, and other altcoins — highlights this dynamic clearly. As Bitcoin reclaimed levels above $60,000, a noticeable shift in volume distribution emerged, suggesting investors increasingly prioritized Bitcoin over higher-risk altcoin exposure.

Bitcoin Dominance Rises As Altcoin Trading Activity Weakens

Altcoin trading activity has weakened noticeably during the current corrective phase, reinforcing the broader shift toward defensive positioning within the crypto market. According to a recent analyst assessment, Bitcoin trading volumes on Binance regained dominance on February 7, accounting for roughly 36.8% of total exchange activity. This leadership has persisted since then, suggesting sustained investor preference for the relative stability and liquidity associated with Bitcoin during uncertain conditions.

In comparison, altcoins represented about 35.3% of total trading volume, while Ethereum accounted for approximately 27.8%. Although these figures still reflect meaningful participation, altcoins have experienced the sharpest contraction in activity. Back in November, altcoins represented around 59.2% of Binance trading volumes, but by February 13 their share had dropped to roughly 33.6%, marking close to a 50% decline in market participation.

Similar patterns have appeared during prior corrective phases, including April 2025, August 2024, and late 2022 near the end of the previous bear cycle. Periods of heightened uncertainty typically drive capital toward Bitcoin, which continues to function as the sector's primary liquidity anchor. This recurring rotation highlights Bitcoin's role as a perceived safer crypto asset when volatility rises and speculative appetite diminishes.

Altcoin Market Cap Weakens As Risk Appetite Remains Limited

The total crypto market capitalization excluding the top 10 assets continues to reflect persistent weakness, highlighting the fragile state of the broader altcoin segment. After peaking near the 2025 highs, this metric entered a sustained corrective phase, with recent price action hovering around the $170–180 billion range. This zone has acted as a tentative support area, but the lack of a strong rebound suggests that risk appetite remains subdued across smaller-cap assets.

Technically, the structure shows the altcoin market trading below key moving averages, indicating that momentum still favors sellers. Previous recovery attempts have repeatedly stalled near dynamic resistance, reinforcing the idea that capital rotation toward major assets — particularly Bitcoin — continues to dominate market behavior. Elevated volatility during the most recent declines also points to fragile liquidity conditions.

Volume dynamics further support this cautious interpretation. Spikes in selling activity accompanied the latest pullback, suggesting distribution rather than accumulation. While stabilization appears to be developing in the short term, there is limited evidence of sustained inflows returning to altcoins.

Historically, similar configurations have often preceded prolonged consolidation phases rather than immediate recoveries. Unless broader market liquidity improves or Bitcoin dominance weakens, the altcoin market may remain structurally constrained despite occasional short-term rebounds.

The latest ETHDenver conference, which got underway earlier this week, has been depicted as a post-apocalyptic wasteland of crumbling booths and discarded conference swag in a new painting by renowned NFT artist Beeple.

Ethereum has declined 29% over the past 12 months, costing investors over $90 billion in market capitalization.

In an effort to convey the sheer scale of the collapse, Beeple, who's one of the highest-earning NFT creators in history, has created a nightmarish scene that imagines a decrepit venue stacked with trash, pigeons, stray dogs, and destitute attendees.

Tattered signs hang from the ceiling and trash boxes are filled with worthless merchandise from prior campaigns like DeFi Summer, NFTs, and memecoins.

The image immediately resonated on Crypto Twitter and spurred users to post their own wasteland jokes. One likened ETHDenver to Skid Row, a famous homeless area of downtown Los Angeles.

Attendance at the flagship Ethereum conference, which once rivaled the largest Bitcoin conference from 2023-2024, has collapsed this year. Indeed, ticket sales have dipped below 10,000 from a previous 25,000 high.

The number of side events planned a month in advance, such as mixers, afterparties, and workshops, also fell 85% from last year's 668.

“I have to say that this was the internal monologue of most of the attendees at ETHDenver,” agreed one attendee.

“The show was about 1/10th the size of last year's. Probably a lot more reminiscent of ETHDenver 2019 and not what we would have expected for ETHDenver 2026.”

“Hilarious Trump even said no ETHDenver and threw a crypto event at Mar a Lago,” noted another observer.

The Trump family's crypto forum in Palm Beach, Florida and a White House stablecoin meeting directly conflicted with the dates of ETHDenver 2026.

Others disagreed entirely. Indeed, Jesse Pollack posted a stream of positive updates, as did other Ethereum permabulls like David Hoffman.

Several users posted photos and videos from the conference floor under Beeple's art to contest his characterization.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin ignored the social drama entirely, quietly posting technical updates. The Ethereum Foundation posted its 2026 roadmap to minimal media attention.

                The intersection of AI and crypto is poised to redefine economic models for creatives. Technology waves often come in pairs or triples, reinforcing each other and creating new opportunities. There is concern over the trend towards closed-source AI, driven by business interests rather than safety.

The AI tool includes predictions of how proteins interact with potential therapeutic molecules.Credit: Isomorphic Labs

Nearly two years after Google DeepMind released an updated AlphaFold3 geared at drug discovery, its biopharmaceuticals spin-off, Isomorphic Labs, announced an even more powerful artificial-intelligence model — and they're keeping it all to themselves.

Isomorphic Labs, based in London, touted the capacities of its ‘drug-discovery engine' — which it calls IsoDDE — in a 27-page technical report, released on 10 February. Achievements, including precise predictions of how proteins interact with potential drugs and antibody structures, have impressed scientists working in the field.

Yet unlike the AlphaFold AI systems for predicting protein structure — which were made accessible to other researchers and described in depth in journal articles1,2 — IsoDDE is proprietary, and the technical paper offers scant insight into how to achieve similar results.

AlphaFold is five years old — these charts show how it revolutionized science

AlphaFold is five years old — these charts show how it revolutionized science

“It's a major advance, on the scale of an AlphaFold4,” referring to an unreleased future generation of Google DeepMind's technology,says Mohammed AlQuraishi, a computational biologist at Columbia University in New York City who is working to develop fully open-source versions of AlphaFold. “The problem, of course, is that we know nothing of the details.”

AlphaFold 3 was developed with drug discovery in mind. Unlike its Nobel-prizewinning predecessor AlphaFold2, the model could predict the structures of proteins interacting with other molecules — including potential drugs.

Similar AIs modelled after AlphaFold 3 have come close to fully matching its performance and have new capabilities. An open-source model called Boltz-2, developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and released last year3, could predict the strength to which potential drugs glom onto proteins, or binding affinity. This is a key property for developing therapeutics and is usually predicted with computationally intensive physics-based methods.

AlphaFold is running out of data — so drug firms are building their own version

According to Isomorphic's report, its new AI outperforms both Boltz-2 and physics-based methods at determining binding affinity. Predictions of how antibodies — which form the basis for therapies that rack up tens of billions of pounds in sales annually — interact with their targets is also state of the art, the report claims.

AlQuraishi says he is especially impressed by the IsoDDE's ability to predict drug–protein interactions of molecules that are vastly different from the data that the model was trained on. “That's the really hard problem, and suggests that they must've done something pretty novel,” he says.

The Department of Homeland Security struck a $1 billion purchasing agreement with Palantir last week, further reinforcing the software company's role in the federal agency that oversees the nation's immigration enforcement.

According to contracting documents published last week, the blanket purchase agreement (BPA) awarded “is to provide Palantir commercial software licenses, maintenance, and implementation services department wide.” The agreement simplifies how DHS buys software from Palantir, allowing DHS agencies like Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to essentially skip the competitive bidding process for new purchases of up to $1 billion in products and services from the company.

Palantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Palantir announced the agreement internally on Friday. It comes as the company is struggling to address growing tensions among staff over its relationship with DHS and ICE. After Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed in January, Palantir staffers flooded company Slack channels demanding information on how the tech they build empowers US immigration enforcement. Since then, the company has updated its internal wiki, offering few unreported details about its work with ICE, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp recorded a video for employees where he attempted to justify the company's immigration work, as WIRED reported last week. Throughout a nearly hourlong conversation with Courtney Bowman, Palantir's global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering, Karp failed to address direct questions about how the company's tech powers ICE. Instead, he said workers could sign nondisclosure agreements for more detailed information.

Akash Jain, Palantir's chief technology officer and president of Palantir US Government Partners, which works with US government agencies, acknowledged these concerns in the email announcing the company's new agreement with DHS. “I recognize that this comes at a time of increased concern, both externally and internally, around our existing work with ICE,” Jain wrote. “While we don't normally send out updates on new contract vehicles, in this moment it felt especially important to provide context to help inform your understanding of what this means—and what it doesn't. There will be opportunities we run toward, and others we decline—that discipline is part of what has earned us DHS's trust.”

In the Friday email, Jain suggests that the five-year agreement could allow the company to expand its reach across DHS into agencies like the US Secret Service (USSS), Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

Jain also argued that Palantir's software could strengthen protections for US citizens. “These protections help enable accountability through strict controls and auditing capabilities, and support adherence to constitutional protections, especially the Fourth Amendment,” Jain wrote. (Palantir's critics have argued that the company's tools create a massive surveillance dragnet, which could ultimately harm civil liberties.)

Over the last year, Palantir's work with ICE has grown tremendously. Last April, WIRED reported that ICE paid Palantir $30 million to build “ImmigrationOS,” which would provide “near real-time visibility” on immigrants self-deporting from the US. Since then, it's been reported that the company has also developed a new tool called Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) which creates maps of potential deportation targets, pulling data from DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Closing his Friday email to staff, Jain suggested that staffers curious about the new DHS agreement come work on it themselves. “As Palantirians, the best way to understand the work is to engage on the work directly. If you are interested in helping shape and deliver the next chapter of Palantir's work across DHS, please reach out,” Jain wrote to employees, who are sometimes referred to internally as fictional creatures from The Lord of the Rings. “There will be a massive need for committed hobbits to turn this momentum into mission outcomes.”

TerraClear's mission to help farmers map and tackle tough field problems such as rocks and weeds has evolved with the launch of a new machine: an autonomous robot called TerraScout.

The startup, based in Issaquah, Wash., and Grangeville, Idaho, says the device can collect ultra-high-resolution imagery across an entire field and convert the data into plans which can be executed by existing farm equipment, such as its rock picker or existing sprayers.

Founded in 2017 with the goal of simplifying the laborious task of removing large rocks from farmers' fields, TerraClear has expanded into AI-powered identification and management of weeds using the same tech stack.

“TerraScout will scout entire fields in almost any condition and turn that intelligence into precise action for existing crews and equipment,” TerraClear CEO Devin Lammers said in a new release Thursday. “Today we focus that output on rock and weed management, but the future applications for this platform are vast. It is my firm belief that this technology will drive the next era of farm productivity gains.”

TerraClear says the robot can collect more than 4 billion image samples per acre and map over 1,000 acres per day at speeds of up to 15 mph. TerraScout can operate autonomously for up to six hours without refueling. Onboard technology turns massive image datasets into actionable maps in real-time.

TerraClear was founded by Brent Frei, the former CEO of Onyx Software and co-founder of Smartsheet. The initial focus was on its rock picker hardware, which can mount to a variety of machines and pick hundreds of rocks per hour, and its AI-powered mapping of fields where those rocks can cause expensive damage to machinery. 

Lammers, a longtime leader in the agriculture technology industry, took over as CEO in August 2024.

The company, which employs about 50 people and has raised about $53 million to date, is not sharing revenue numbers, but is closing in on 1,000 customers.

Field trials for TerraScout began earlier this year and TerraClear said it will expand trials to existing retail partners and select farm customers this spring.

SoftBank subsidiary SB Energy is expected to build a massive 9.2 gigawatt natural gas-fired power plant on the Ohio-Kentucky border, according to a report from Bloomberg. If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.

With a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It's unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.

The Japanese investor is a partner in the Stargate project with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are in the process of building a “proof of concept” data center at GM's former Lordstown automotive assembly plant.

A power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to our calculations based on public, energy-use metrics. When including methane leaks from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could even be even bigger.

Sam Basu quit his job as a senior software engineer at Google in early 2023, not long after OpenAI released ChatGPT. He took a few stabs at starting new AI businesses, but nothing really stuck until he got a call from a friend who wanted help filling out customs paperwork.

Basu got “very curious” and started cold-calling customs brokers in the Los Angeles area. He learned that many are mom-and-pop affairs still deeply reliant on fax machines and paper. When his first customer showed him stacks of manila folders during a FaceTime tour of her office, everything clicked, Basu told TechCrunch. He flew to that customer's office the next day.

“That was the eye-opening moment. There's just papers and papers,” Basu said in a recent interview. “I was both shocked and impressed. Shocked that this is how the industry runs, and impressed that everything around us, from the watch that you're wearing to the glasses, literally everything that's imported, and this is what's happening behind the scenes.”

This seed of an idea is now called Amari AI, a startup co-founded by Basu and Arushi Vashist, a former senior software engineer at LinkedIn. The pair, and their small team, have already collected more than 30 customers, and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods. 

Amari has also raised $4.5 million of funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC, all before coming out of stealth mode on Thursday.

Basu has two goals with Amari. One is to help customs brokers modernize. To date, he said, many of them have done little work to integrate new technologies. Some leverage optical character recognition software to help speed up data entry, but that tech is limited and brittle, he said. Amari is meant to help automate data entry and paperwork, and let employees — who legally must be in the United States, meaning companies can't use off-shore workers — focus on helping customers move their goods across the border.

That's where the second goal comes in. President Donald Trump's chaotic trade policy has made customs brokers all the more important, according to Chris Bachinski, CEO of 125-year-old firm GHY International. Bachinski — who is one of Amari's early adopters — told TechCrunch that many of his own customers don't even have their own compliance staff. Instead, they look to the brokers like GHY to help figure out how sudden changes in trade policy apply to their goods, especially if they are already in transit.

This chaos has led to burnout across the industry, according to Basu. With the employee base tightly regulated, and a licensing exam pass rate that hovers around 10% to 20%, “it's a perfect fit for AI,” he said.

“Experienced people are leaving the industry or taking early retirement,” Basu said. “So we're pitching ourselves as these extra set of hands that logistics companies can hire or keep alongside the human expertise.”

Basu said Amari's AI agents constantly monitor trade rules and update their reasoning any time there's a change, making it easier for brokers to help their customers quickly understand any impact. Previously, these kinds of sudden changes required manual research that would slow down brokers' ability to clear cargo into the country.

Amari does this by building its own AI models trained on more than one million documents related to the shipments it's already helped clear through customs, though Basu said the company has been leveraging off-the-shelf models to date. He noted some customers do opt out of this training, and that Amari anonymizes the data before feeding it to the models. 

“We do not sell their data, and we make sure that their data is theirs,” he said. “They're very serious about these documents.”

Todd Jackson, a partner at First Round Capital, attributed Amari's early success to Basu's willingness to pound the pavement in order to learn what these brokers need.

“He's going to conferences, he's going to trade shows, [and] the word of mouth starts to get very strong,” Jackson said in an interview. “It's an old-school industry.”

It was at one of these trade shows — the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, to be precise — that one of Basu's presentations caught Bachinski's eye. GHY International is not a mom-and-pop, but it's also not a Fortune 500 like FedEx; Bachinski has been looking for ways to both stay competitive and grow his company.

Bachinski said the biggest concern amongst GHY employees so far has been job loss. But he's told them not to worry. He said he expects tech like Amari's to help GHY grow, and to focus more on the customer relationships and compliance work.

“It's an old industry, and technology is going to shift our industry faster than I think most customs brokers understand,” he said. And with trade now constantly in the spotlight, he said brokers need to be agile. “I make this joke that last year, the first time in history, our families know what we do for a living. Because all of a sudden, custom brokers became very, very important.”

This coding agent is minimal, and it completely changed how I used models and Claude's cli now feels like extremely slow bloat.I'd not be surprised if you're right in that this is companies / management will prefer to ""pay for a complete package"" approach for a long while, but power-users should not care for the model providers.I have like 100 lines of code to get me a tmux controls & semaphore_wait extension in the pi harness. That gave me a better orchestration scheme a month ago when I adopted it, than Claude has right now.As far as I can tell, the more you try to train your model on your harness, the worse they get. Bitter lesson #2932.

The reason these LLM tools being good is they can ""just do stuff."" Anthropic bans third party subscription auth? I'll just have my other tool use Claude Code in tmux. If third party agents can be banned from doing stuff (some advanced always on spyware or whatever), then a large chunk of the promise of AI is dead.Amp just announced today they are dumping IDE integration. Models seem to run better on bare-bones software like Pi, and you can add or remove stuff on the fly because the whole things open source. The software writes itself. Is Microsoft just trying to cram a whole new paradigm in to an old package? Kind of like a computer printer. It will be a big business, but it isn't the future.At scale, the end provider ultimately has to serve the inference -- they need the hardware, data centers & the electricity to power those data centers. Someone like Microsoft can also provide a SLA and price such appropriately. I'll avoid a $200/month customer acquisition cost rant, but one user, running a bunch of sub agents, can spend a ton of money. If you don't own a business or funding source, the way state of the art LLMs are being used today is totally uneconomical (easy $200+ an hour at API prices.)36+ months out, if they overbuild the data centers and the revenue doesn't come in like OpenAI & Anthropic are forecasting, there will be a glut of hardware. If that's the case I'd expect local model usage will scale up too and it will get more difficult for enterprise providers.(Nothing is certain but some things have become a bit more obvious than they were 6 months ago.)

Bloated apps are a material disadvantage. If I'm in a competitive industry that slow down alone can mean failure. The only thing Claude Code has going for it now is the loss making $200 month subsidy. Is there any conceivable GUI overlay that Anthropic or OpenAI can add to make their software better than the current terminal apps? Sure, for certain edge cases, but then why isn't the user building those themselves? 24 months ago we could have said that's too hard, but that isn't the case in 2026.Microsoft added all of this stuff in to Windows, and it's a 5 alarm fire. Stuff that used to be usable is a mess and really slow. Running linux with Claude Code, Codex, or Pi is clearly superior to having a Windows device with neither (if it wasn't possible to run these in Windows; just a hypothetical.)From the business/enterprise perspective - there is no single most important thing, but having an environment that is reliable and predictable is high up there. Monday morning, an the Anthropic API endpoint is down, uh oh! In the longer term, businesses will really want to control both the model and the software that interfaces with it.If the end game is just the same as talking to the Star Trek computer, and competitors are narrowing gaps rather than widening them (e.g. Anthropic and OpenAI releases models minutes from each other now, Chinese frontier models getting closer in capability not further), then it is really hard to see how either company achieves a vertical lock down.We could actually move down the stack, and then the real problem for OpenAI and Anthropic is nVidia. 2030, the data center expansion is bust, nVidia starts selling all of these cards to consumers directly and has a huge financial incentive to make sure the performant local models exist. Everyone in the semiconductor supply chain below nvidia only cares about keeping sales going, so it stops with them.Maybe nvidia is the real winner?Also is it just me or does it now feel like hn comments are just talking to a future LLM?

The advances in the Claude Code harness have been more around workflow automation rather than capability improvements, and truthfully workflows are very user-dependent, so an opinionated harness is only ever going to be ""right"" for a narrow segment of users, and it's going to annoy a lot of others. This is happening now, but the sub subsidy washes out a lot of the discontent.

There are parallels to the silly Metaverse hype wave from a few years ago. At the time I saw a surprising number of people defending the investment saying it was important for Facebook to control their own platform. Well sure it's beneficial for Facebook to control a platform, but that benefit is purely for the company and if anything it would harm current and future users. Unsurprisingly, the pitch to please think of this giant corporation's needs wasn't a compelling pitch in the end.

This whole game is a bizarre battle.In the future, many companies will have slightly different secret RL sauces.

And that's out of the box.

If they think they need to ban me for that, then, oh well. I'll just continue to keep using pi. Just no longer with Claude models.

It's kind of like a new restaurant started handing out coupons for ""90% off"", wanting to attract diners to the restaurant, customers started coming in and ordering bulk meals then immediately packaging them in tupperware containers and taking it home (violating the spirit of the arrangement, even if not the letter of the arrangement), so the restaurant changed the terms on the discount to say ""limited to in-store consumption only, not eligible for take-home meals"", and instead of still being grateful that they're getting food for 90% off, the cheapskate customers are getting angry that they're no longer allowed to exploit the massive subsidy however they want.

Here, they put limits on the ""under-cover"" use of the subscription. If they can provide a relatively cheap subscription against the direct API use, this is because they can control the stuff end-to-end, the application running on your system (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) and their systems.As you subscribe to these plans, this is the ""contract"", you can use only through their tools. If you want full freedom, use the API, with a per token pricing.For me, this is fair.

I am very curious what is particularly illegal about this. On the sales page nowhere do they actually talk about the API https://claude.com/pricingNow we all know obviously the API is being used because that is how things work, but you are not actually paying a subscription for the API. You are paying for access to Claude Code.Is it also illegal that if you pay for Playstation Plus that you can't play those games on an Xbox?Is it illegal that you can't use third party netflix apps?I really don't want to defend and AI company here but this is perfectly normal. In no other situation would we expect access to the API, the only reason this is considered different is because they also have a different service that gives access to the API. But that is irrelevant.

Anthropic provides an API third-party clients can use. The pro-market position is that the API must be available at every pricing tier, as the benefits from increased competition outweigh the imposed restrictions to business practices. The pro-business position is that Anthropic must be allowed to choose which tiers can use the API, as the benefits from increased freedom outweigh the reduced competition in the market.

reply

While I do personally disagree with thinking that you should be able to do this when it was never sold in that way, at the end of the day as a customer you can choose if you want to use the product in the way that they are saying or use something else if you don't want to support that model.However the person I was responding too brought up legality which is a very different discussion.

But if that is the service they are making and they are clear about what it is when you sign up... That does not make it illegal.I can see why people think they should be entitled to do this, but it does not align with how they are selling the service or how many other companies sell services. In most situations you don't get unlimited access to the individual components of how a service works (the API), you are expected to use the service (in this case Claude Code) directly.

""Both parties are okay with the terms"" is far from being sufficient to make something ""legal"".Tie-in sales between software and services is not different from price dumping. If any of the Big Tech corporations were from any country that is not the US, the FTC would be doing anything in their power to stop them.

I disagree, in many cases what you are specifically paying for is the combination of the software and the service that are designed to work together. And in many cases do not work independent of eachother.There are countless cases of this, that what you are paying for is a thing that is made up of a piece of software and a serverside component. MMO's (and gaming in general) being a major example of this, but so are many of the apps I pay for subscriptions for on my phone.The actual technical implementation of how it works is irrelevant when it is clear what it is you are paying for.> ""Both parties are okay with the terms"" is far from being sufficient to make something ""legal"".True but the opposite is also true, just because you don't like the terms it does not make it illegal.

If that was true, then getting equivalent usage of the API without claude.ai and Claude Code should cost less, not more.You can try to find all sorts of explanations for it, at the end of the day is quite simple: they are subsidizing one product in order to grow the market share, and they are doing it at a loss now, because they believe they will make up for it later.

You'd have to point me to an authoritative source on that (explicitly saying users are allowed to use their models via private APIs in apps of the user's choosing). If something isn't explicitly provided in the contract, then it can be changed at any point in any way without notice.Honestly, I'm not big on capitalism in general, but I don't understand why people should expect companies to provide things exactly the way they want at exactly the prices they would like to be charged (if at all). That's just not how the world/system works, or should, especially given there are so many alternatives available. If one doesn't like what's happening with some service, then let the wallet do the talking and move to another. Emigration is a far more effective message than complaining.

Look at it this way: the service that you're accessing is really a (primarily desired) side-effect of the software. So re subscriptions, what they're actually providing are the apps (web, desktop, etc), and the apps use their service to aid the fulfillment of their functionality. Those wanting direct access to the internal service can get an API key for that purpose. That's just how their product offering is structured.

I don't have a dog in this fight but is this actually true?  If you're using Claude Code they can know that whatever client-side model selection they put into it is active.  So if they can get away with routing 80% of the requests to Haiku and only route to Opus for the requests that really need it, that does give them a cost model where they can rely on lower costs than if a third-party client just routes to Opus for everything.  Even if they aren't doing that sort of thing now, it would be understandable if they wanted to.

reply

They still have the total consumption under their control (*bar prompt caching and other specific optimizations) where in the past they even had different quotas per model, it shouldn't cost them more money, just be a worse/different service I guess

reply

As things are currently, better models mean bigger models that take more storage+RAM+CPU, or just spend more time processing a request. All this translates to higher costs, and may be mitigated by particular configs triggered by knowledge that a given client, providing particular guarantees, is on the other side.

If subsidizing that offering is a good hook to get higher paying API users on board, then some of that cost is a customer aquisition cost, whereas the cost to them of providing the API doesn't have the same proportion that they can justify as a customer acquisition cost.

This sounds like engineering, finance, and legal got together and decided they were in an untenable position if OpenAI started nudging OpenClaw to burn even more tokens on Anthropic (or just never optimize) + continually updated workarounds to using subscription auth. But I'm sure OpenAI would never do something like that...At the end of the day, it's the same 'fixed price plan for variable use on a constrained resource' cellular problem: profitability becomes directly linked to actual average usage.

You can of course use OpenCode or any other project with the API, which is also offered as a separate product. People just don't want to do that because it's not subsidized, ie. more expensive. But the entire reason it's subsidized is that Anthropic can use the data to improve their product.

reply

This is grade A, absolute crap. It's subsidized because everyone else is subsidizing it, and everyone is doing it because they are trying to lock their consumer share.The solution is quite simple. Just get the FTC to forbid tie-in sales so that we don't get the huge corporations using their infinite resources to outlive the competition. Anthropic/Amazon/Google/OpenAI/Facebook can offer any type of service they want, but if the access to the API costs $X when offered standalone, then that is the baseline price for anything that depends on the API to work.

In reality, heavy subscription users are subsidized by light subscription users.

Probably the ToS change was to make it more clear.To be fair, the developer is the one breaking the ToS in the most significant way, breaking boilerplate reverse engineering clauses.But the user also is very aware that they are doing something funny, in order to authenticate, the user is asked to authorize Claude Code, n ot Opencode or OpenClaw, it's clearly a hack and there is no authorization from Anthropic to OpenClaw, and you are not giving Anthropic authorization to give access to OC, the user asks Anthropic to give access to Claude Code, the only reason this works is because OC is pretending to be Claude Code.The bottom line issue is that as a user you are paying for a subscription to a package that includes an expected usage. That package is not metered, but it is given on the condition that you will use it as it is expected to be used, by chatting manually with the chatbot, which results in a reasonable expected token usage. By using a program that programatically calls the chat interface, the token consumption increases beyond what was part of the original deal, and so the price should be different.A similar scenario would be if you go to an all you can eat buffet, you pay for a single person, but then you actually unload an army of little clones that start eating the whole buffet. Technically it was an all you can eat buffet and you paid the price right? Well no, come on, don't play dumb.

It's just price differentiation - they know consumers are price sensitive, and that companies wanting to use their APIs to build products so they can slap AI on their portfolio and get access to AI-related investor money can be milked. On the consumer-facing front, they live off branding and if you're not using claude code, you might not associate the tool with Anthropic, which means losing publicity that drives API sales.

Instead, many, many websites (especially in the music industry) have some sort of funky API that you can only get access to if you have enough online clout. Very few are transparent about what ""enough clout"" even means or how much it'd cost you, and there's like an entire industry of third-party API resellers that cost like 10x more than if you went straight to the source. But you can't, because you first have to fulfill some arbitrary criteria that you can't even know about ahead of time.It's all very frustrating to deal with.

I just think that OAI/Anthropic will try to keep both types of users locked into their walled garden via the UI.The APIs may have a future, but at our own peril and zero guarantees. It's a tool to create traction and demonstrate capabilities to devs.

There is nothing here stopping cambridge analytica from doing this again, they will provide whatever details needed. But a small pre launch personal project work that might use a facebook publishing application can't be developed or tested without first going through all the bureaucracy.Nevermind the non profit 'free' application you might want to create on the FB platform, lets say a share chrome extension ""Post to my FB"", for personal use, you can't do this because you can't create an application without a company and IVA/TAX documents. It's hostile imo.Before, you could create an app, link your ToS, privacy policy etc, verify your domain via email, and then if users wanted to use your application they would agree, this is how a lot of companies still do it. I'm actually not sure why FB do this specifically.

Spotify in particular is just patently the very worst. They released an amazing and delightful app sdk, allowing for making really neat apps in the desktop app in 2011. Then cancelled it by 2014. It feels like their entire ecosystem has only ever gone downhill. Their car device was cancelled nearly immediately. Every API just gets worse and worse. Remarkable to see a company have only ever such a downward slide. The Spotify Graveyard is, imo, a place of singnificantly less honor than the Google Graveyard. https://web.archive.org/web/20141104154131/https://gigaom.co...But also, I feel like this broad repulsive trend is such an untenable position now that AI is here.

Adoption will be slow, this isn't happening fast, but people who can mix human + agent activity on your site are going to be delighted by the experience, and that you will spread!WebMCP is better IMHO than conventional APIs because it layers into the experience you are already having.

I totally understand that I should not reuse my own account to provide services to others, as direct API usage is the obvious choice here, but this is a different case.I am currently developing something that would be the perfect fit for this OAuth based flow and I find it quite frustrating that in most cases I cannot find a clear answer to this question.

I used Claude back when API per token pricing was the only option and it was bad for all the usual reasons pay-per-use sucks compared to flat billing: you're constantly thinking about cost. Like trying to watch a Netflix video with a ticker in the corner counting up the cents you owe them.I don't understand your claim that they want people paying per token - the subscription is the opposite of that, and it also has upsides for them as a business since most people don't saturate the usage limits, and the business gets to stuff a bunch of value-adds on a bundle offering which is generally a more lucrative and enticing consumer pricing model.

Ask sports betting operators from back in 2019-2022 how it worked out for them when they tried to give out 1-2k a year to attract new customers, and then realized their customers will switch platforms in an instant they see a new shiny offer. Look up the Fanduel Founders ""exit"" for an insight into this.They have to eventually stop catering to the slot machine users, which are generally paying for these hugely lossy flat rate subscriptions, and somehow get them used to a different type of payment model, or cater strictly to enterprise... Which also aren't going to tolerate paying 20k a month in tokens per developer, is my guess.... Lots of delicate pricing problems to figure out for all these companies.

On the other hand OpenAI and GitHub Copilot have, as far as I know, explicitly allowed their users to connect to at least some third party tools and use their quotas from there, notably to OpenCode.What is unclear to me is whether they are considering also allowing commercial apps to do that. For instance if I publish a subscription based app and my users pay for the app itself rather than for LLM inference, would that be allowed?

If OpenCode or whatever burns through your limits faster, are you likely to place the blame on OpenCode?Maybe a good analogy was when DoorDash/GrubHub/Uber Eats/etc signed up restaurants to their system without their permission. When things didn't go well, the customers complained about the restaurants, even though it wasn't their fault, because they chose not to support delivery at scale.Second, flat-rate pricing, unlike API pricing, is the same for cached vs uncached iirc, so even if total token limits are the same, less caching means higher costs.

And there's a good reason the most ""famous"" vibe coders, including the OpenClaw creator all moved to Codex, it's just better.Claude writes a lot more code to do anything, tons of redundent code, repeated code etc. Codex is only model I've seen which occasionally removes more code than it writes.

Claude has gotten a lot of popular media attention in the last few weeks, and the influx of users is constraining compute/memory on an already compute heavy model.
So you get all the suspected ""tricks"" like quantization, shorter thinking, KV cache optimizations.It feels like the same thing that happened to Gemini 3, and what you can even feel throughout the day (the models seem smartest at 12am).Dario in his interview with dwarkesh last week also lamented the same refrain that other lab leaders have: compute is constrained and there are big tradeoffs in how you allocate it. It feels safe to reason then that they will use any trick they can to free up compute.

What is interesting is that OpenAI and GitHub seem to be taking the opposite approach with Copilot/OpenCode, essentially treating third-party tool access as a feature that increases subscription stickiness. Different bets on whether the LTV of a retained subscriber outweighs the marginal inference cost.Would not be surprised if this converges eventually. Either Anthropic opens up once their margins improve, or OpenAI tightens once they realize the arbitrage is too expensive at scale.

I'm rather certain, though cannot prove it, that buying the same tokens would cost at least 10x more if bought from API. Anecdotally, my cursor team usage was getting to around 700$ / month. After switching to claude code max, I have so far only once hit the 3h limit window on the 100$ sub.What Im thinking is that Anthropic is making loss with users who use it a lot, but there are a lot of users who pay for max, but don't actually use it.With the recent improvements and increase of popularity in projects like OpenClaw, the number of users that are generating loss has probably massively increased.

API limits are infinite but you'd blow through $20 of usage in a maybe 1 hours or less of intense Opus use.The subscription at $20/mo (or $200) allows for vastly more queries than $20 would buy you via API but you are constrained by hourly/weekly limits.The $20/mo sub user will take a lot longer to complete a high token count task (due to start/stop) BUT they will cap their costs.

Google AI Pro is like $15/month for practically unlimited Pro requests, each of which take million tokens of context (and then also perform thinking, free Google search for grounding, inline image generation if needed).

Google already has a huge competitive advantage because they have more data than anyone else, bundle Gemini in each android to siphon even more data, and the android platform.

reply

My point was simpler: they're almost certainly not losing money on subscriptions because of inference. Inference is relatively cheap. And of course the big cost is training and ongoing R&D.The real issue is the market they're in. They're competing with companies like Kimi and DeepSeek that also spend heavily on R&D but release strong models openly. That means anyone can run inference and customers can use it without paying for bundled research costs.Training frontier models takes months, costs billions, and the model is outdated in six months. I just don't see how a closed, subscription-only model reliably covers that in the long run, especially if you're tightening ecosystem access at the same time.

It's also false that the technology has changed very little.The jumps from bronze to iron to steel to modern steel and sometimes to stainless steel all result in vastly different products.

all closed AI model providers will stop selling APIs in the next 2-3 years. Only open models will be available via APIs (…) Closed model providers are trying to build non-commodity capabilities and they need great UIs to deliver those.

I only use LLMs through OpenRouter and switch somewhat randomly between frontier models; they each have some amount of personality but I wouldn't mind much if half of them disappeared overnight, as long as the other half remained available.

With the AI models, using a model that is “good enough but cheaper” is already an option.

I imagine the split will look a lot like b2b vs b2c in other technologies, b2b customers tend to be willing to pay for tech when it offers a competitive advantage, reduces their operating costs etc. b2c customers mostly just guzzle free slop.

A model is hard to train but it doesn't need to be hyper up to date / have a new version come out every day. Inference is cheap (it seems?) and quality is comparable. So it's unclear how expensive offerings could win over free alternatives.I could be wrong of course. I don't have a crystal ball. I just don't think this is the same as Google.Of course I could be entirely mistaken and there could emerge a single winner

Software always gets monopoly simply by usage. Every time a model gets used by esoteric use cases, it gets more training data (that a decentralized open weight model doesn't get) and it starts developing its moat.

They bundled it with PC hw and the vast majority of apps only ever got published for windows, and this over decades (one would argue it's still true).The starting point for LLMs is very different. Who would publish today a software that only integrates with chatGPT? Only a small minority.Thus I agree, I struggle to see how a monopoly can exist here. A GPU monopoly or duopoly though, perhaps.

First of all, custom harness parallel agent people are so far from the norm, and certainly not on the $20 plan, which doesn't even make sense because you'd hit token limit in about 90 seconds.Second, token limits. Does Anthropic secretly have over-subscription issues? Don't know, don't care. If I'm paying a blistering monthly fee, I should be able to use up to the limit.Now I know you've got a clear view of the typical user, but FWIW, I'm just an aging hacker using CC to build some personal projects (feeling modern ofc) but still driving, no yolo or gas town style. I've reached the point where I have a nice workflow, and CC is pretty decent, but it feels like it's putting on weight and adding things I don't want or need.I think LLMs are an exciting new interface to computers, but I don't want to be tied to someone else's idea of a client, especially not one that's changing so rapidly. I'd like to roll my own client to interface with the model, or maybe try out some other alternatives, but that's against the TOS, because: reasons.And no, I'm not interested in paying metered corporate rates for API access. I pay for a Max account, it's expensive, but predictable.The issue is Anthropic is trying for force users into using their tool, but that's not going to work for something so generic as interfacing with an LLM. Some folks want emacs while others want vim, and there will never be a consensus on the best editor (it's nvim btw), because developers are opinionated and have strong preferences for how they interface with computers. I switched to CC maybe a year ago and haven't looked back, but this is a major disappointment. I don't give a shit about Anthropic's credit liability, I just want the freedom to hack on my own client.

Anthropic sells two products: a consumer subscription with a UI, and an API with metered pricing. You want the API product at the subscription price. That's not a principled stance about interface freedom, it's just wanting something for less than it costs.The nvim analogy doesn't land either. Nobody's stopping you from writing your own client. You just have to pay API rates for it, because that's the product that matches what you're describing. The subscription subsidises the cost per token by constraining how you use it. Remove the constraint, the economics break. This isn't complicated.""I don't give a shit about Anthropic's credit liability,"" right, but they do, because it's their business. You're not entitled to a flat-rate all-you-can-eat API just because you find metered pricing aesthetically displeasing.

I'm not trying to arbitrage or route around anything, I just want predictable billing to access the model. Maybe the API would be cheaper for me, I don't know. I'm just a normal user, not scheduling an agent army to blast at maximum 24/7.You don't need to explain what Anthropic is selling, I get it, but you're off-base claiming that I'm pretending about editor philosophy as cope. I think Anthropic is where they are today because they have a good model for coding, made popular by software folks who value things like editor choice and customization. Anthropic is free to do as they wish of course, as am I, but I'm displeased with their decision here, and voicing my opinion about it.If usage is truly constrained by the client not the server, I guess I can't argue that, but it still feels bad as an end user. As a consumer, I just want a fair deal and freedom to use what I purchase however I see fit. But that seems harder to find these days, and most businesses seem intent on maximum extraction by any means possible. I might be wrong, but this feels like business move to build a consumer moat by controlling the interface, because consumers don't want the API. It's not in my best interests, which alienates me as a customer.

This could be used to adhere to Claude's TOS while still allowing the user to switch AI companies at a moment's notice.Right now there's limited customizability in this approach, but I think it's not far-fetched to see FAR more integrated solutions in the future if the lock-in trend continues. For example: one MCP that you can configure into a coding agent like Claude Code that overrides its entire behavior (tools, skills, etc.) to a different unified open-source system. Think something similar to the existing IntelliJ IDEA's MCP that gives a separate file edit tool, etc. than the one the agent comes with.Illustration of what i'm talking about:- You install Claude Code with no configuration- Then you install the meta-agent framework- With one command the meta-agent MCP is installed in Claude Code, built-in tools are disabled via permissions override- You access the meta-agent through a different UI (similar to vibe-kanban's web UI)- Everything you do gets routed directly to Claude Code, using your Claude subscription legally. (Input-level features like commands get resolved by meta-agent UI before being sent to claude code)- Claude Code must use the tools and skills directly from meta-agent MCP as instructed in the prompt, and because its own tools are permission denied (result: very good UI integration with the meta-agent UI)- This would also work with any other CLI coding agent (Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI etc.) should they start getting ideas of locking users in- If Claude Code rug-pulls subscription quotas, just switch to a competitor instantlyAll it requires is a CLI coding agent with MCP support, and the TOS allowing automatic use of its UI (disallowing that would be massive hypocrisy as the AI companies themselves make computer use agents that allow automatic use of other apps' UI)

From a backend perspective, the subscription model creates perverse incentives. Heavy users (like developers running agentic workflows) consume far more compute than casual users, but pay the same price. Third-party tools amplify this asymmetry.Anthropic's move is economically rational but strategically risky. Models are increasingly fungible - Gemini 3.1 and Claude 4.5 produce similar results for most tasks. The lock-in isn't the model; it's the tooling ecosystem.By forcing users onto Claude Code exclusively, they're betting their tooling moat is stronger than competitor models. Given how quickly open-source harnesses like pi have caught up, that's a bold bet.

I think what they want to achieve here is less ""kill openclaw"" or similar and more ""keep our losses under control in general"". And now they have a clear criteria to refer when they take action and a good bisection on whom to act on.In case your usage is high they would block / take action. Because if you have your max subscription and not really losing them money, why should they push you (the monopoly incentive sounds wrong with the current market).

There are many other options too: direct API, other model providers, etc. But Opus is particularly good for ""agent with a personality"" applications, so it's what thousands of OpenClaw users go with, mostly via the OAuth token, because it's much cheaper than the API.

They are literally alienating a large percentage of OpenClaw, NanoClaw, PicoClaw, customers because those customers will surely not be willing to pay API pricing, which is at least 6-10x Max Plan pricing (for my usage).This isn't too surprising to me since they probably have a direct competitor to openclaw et al in the works right now, but until then I am cancelling my subscription and porting my nanoclaw fork with mem0 integration to work with OpenAI instead.Thats not a “That'll teach ‘em” statement, it is just my own cost optimization. I am quite fond of Anthropic's coding models and might still subscribe again at the $20 level, but they just priced me out for personal assistant, research, and 90% of my token use case.

Once again: you can use API keys and pricing to get UNLIMITED usage whenever you want. If you are choosing to pay for a subscription instead, it is because Anthropic is offering those subscriptions at a much better value-per-token. They are not offering such a subscription out of the goodness of their heart.

At its core it's a tragedy of commons situation. Using a third party tool like OpenClaw is augmenting your usage far beyond what was anticipated when the subscription plan was made.Same deal for unlimited storage on drive until people started abusing it.

reply

I didn't set the limits on the plan; change those if it's a problem, not irritate your customer base.

reply

The issue is not that it's limited or unlimited, but rather about expected token usage across a user cohort. When you set a usage limit on something like Claude, or a gym, or a tutoring center, you need to do two things at once; set the limit high enough to attract the aspirations of your intended client base (""oh good this gym lets me go every day of the month if I want to""), but priced accurately enough so that you actually turn a profit on the average usage across most users (you ended up going 20 times the first month, but settled into 15 times a month after).If there was suddenly a drug that you could take that would, while you slept, make your body walk to the gym and workout, so that you could max out that usage, the gym would be entitled to adjust either the pricing, the limit, or prohibit going to the gym while on the drug, given that they can't actually sustain all their members going every day.As a correction, I've done some reading and when I said tragedy of the commons, what would fit better is a ""congestion externality in a  club good"".

It's more buying a season pass for Disneyland, then getting told you can't park for free if you're entering the park even though free parking is included with the pass. Still not unreasonable, but brings to light the intention of the tool is to force the user into an ecosystem rather.

reply

But 'you can't park even though the ticket includes parking' is not an appropriate analogy because 3rd party use is definitely not intended. They did not 'state one thing' and the 'disallow it'.This is a pretty straight forward case of people using their subscription for 'adjacent' use, and Anthropic being more explicit about it.There's nothing fancy going on here.

You're now misinterpreting my argument and misrepresenting it. I did not, in any way, suggest that Anthropic was ""pulling the rug"" to its users nor that they were entitled to use their tokens using the API with third parties. Full stop.Of course, third-party API usage wasn't intended to be allowed for consuming subscription tokens. This is exactly what my analogy was structured to explain; a Disneyland season pass isn't intended to be used solely for parking. Anthropic did not intend for subscription tokens to be consumed by third-parties the same way users did not intend to abuse the subscription to derive more value than what was allotted to them. Your analogy missed that last part, which is absolutely crucial to understand.I don't understand how you're making the exact arguments I'm making, then somehow completely misunderstanding what's being said.

Many ways, and they're under no obligation to play fair and tell you which way they're using at any given time. They've said what the rules are, they've said they'll ban you if they catch you.So let's say they enforce it by adding an extra nonstandard challenge-response handshake at the beginning of the exchange, which generates a token which they'll expect on all requests going forward. You decompile the minified JS code, figure out the protocol, try it from your own code but accidentally mess up a small detail (you didn't realize the nonce has a special suffix). Detected. Banned.You'll need a new credit card to open a new account and try again. Better get the protocol right on the first try this time, because debugging is going to get expensive.Let's say you get frustrated and post on Twitter about what you know so far. If you share info, they'll probably see it eventually and change their method. They'll probably change it once a month anyway and see who they catch that way (and presumably add a minimum Claude Code version needed to reach their servers).They've got hundreds of super smart coders and one of the most powerful AI models, they can do this all day.

There are lots of ways they could be doing this.

I'm sure a few people will figure it out, but they won't want to tell anyone lest Anthropic nerf their workaround, so I doubt that exploits of this will become widespread.And if you're Anthropic, that's probably good enough.

The feature allows the LLM to edit the context. For example, you can ""compact"" just portions of the conversation and replace it with a summary. Anthropic can see that the conversation suddenly doesn't share the same history as previous API calls.In fact, I ported the feature to Claude Code using tweakcc, so it literally _is_ Claude Code. After a couple days they started blocking that with the same message that they send when they block third party tools.

It suggests to me Anthropic is less concerned with the financial impact of letting subscribers use alternative tools and more concerned with creating lock in to their products and subscriptions. It very well might backfire though, I was not considering alternative models yesterday, but today I am actively exploring other options and considering cancelling my sub. I've been using my subscription primarily through pi recently, so if they aren't interested in me as a customer, pretty much everyone else is.

This is the VC funded startup playbook. It has been repeated many times, but maybe for the younger crowd it is new. Start a new service that is relatively permissive, then gradually restrict APIs and permissions. Finally, start throwing in ads and/or making it more expensive to use. Part of the reason is in the beginning they are trying to get as many users as possible and burning VC money. Then once the honey moon is over, they need to make a profit so they cut back on services, nerf stuff, increase prices and start adding ads.

They're losing the exact crowd that they want in their corner because it's the crowd that's far more likely to be making the decisions when companies start pivoting their workflows en-masse.

Regarding consumer freedom, I believe software running on user machines should serve the interests of the user, not the company who wrote the software or anyone else for that matter. Trying to force users to run a particular client written by your company violates this principle.Regarding competition, forcing users to run a particular client is a form of anti competitive bundling, a naked attempt to prevent alternative clients from being able to enter the market unless they are able to build a competing backed as well. Such artificial ""moats"" are great for companies but harmful to consumers.

There is barely any magic in the harness, the magic is in the model.Try it: write your own harness with (bash, read, write, edit) ... it's trivial to get a 99% version of (pick your favorite harness) -- minus the bells and whistles.The ""magic of the harness"" comes from the fun auxiliary orchestration stuff - hard engineering for sure! - but seriously, the model is the key item.

The markets value recurring subscription revenue at something like 10x “one-off” revenue, Anthropic is leaving a lot of enterprise value on the table with this approach.In practice this approach forces AI apps to pay Anthropic for tokens, and then bill their customers a subscription. Customers could bring their own API key but it's sketchy to put that into every app you want to try, and consumers aren't going to use developer tools. And many categories of free app are simply excluded, which could in aggregate drive a lot more demand for subscriptions.If Anthropic is worried about quota, seems they could set lower caps for third-party subscription usage? Still better than forcing API keys.(Maybe this is purely about displacing other IDE products, rather than a broader market play.)

Look at your token usage of the last 30 days in one of the JSON files generated by Claude Code. Compare that against API costs for Opus. Tell me if they are eating losses or not. I'm not making a point, actually do it and let me know. I was at 1 million. I'm paying 90 EUR/m. That means I'm subsidizing them (paying 3-4 times what it would cost with the API)! And I feel like I'm a pretty heavy user. Although people running it in a loop or using Gas Town will be using much more.

reply

Over 9 days I would have spent roughly $63 dollars on Codex with 11.5M input tokens plus 141M cached input tokens and 1.3M output tokens.That roughly mirrors the $100-200/wk in API spending that drove me to the subscription.  | Category | Tokens | Rate (/1M) | Estimated Cost |

It took me days to get that build to work; doing this compilation once in CI so you don't have to do it on every machine is trickier than it sounds in Julia. The ""obvious"" way (install packages in Docker, run container on target machine) does not work because Julia wants to see exactly the same machine that it was precompiled on. It ends up precompiling again every time you run the container on other machines. I nearly shed a tear the first time I got Julia not to precompile everything again on a new machine.R and Python are done in five minutes on the standard worker and it was easy; it's just the amount of time it takes to download and extract the prebuilt binaries. Do that inside a Docker container and it's portable as expected. I maintain Linux and Windows environments for the three languages and Julia causes me the most headaches, by far. I absolutely do not care about the tiny improvement in performance from compiling for my particular microarch; I would opt into prebuilt x86_64 generic binaries if Julia had them. I'm very happy to take R's and Python's prebuilt binaries.

""Data science"" is an extremely broad term, so YMMV. That said, since you asked, Julia has absolutely replaced Python for me. I don't have anything new to add on the benefits of Julia; it's all been said before elsewhere. It's just a question of exactly what kind of stuff you want to do. Most of my recent work is math/algorithms flavored, and Python would be annoyingly verbose/inexpressive while also being substantially slower. Julia also tends to have many more high-quality packages of this kind that I can quickly use / build on.

I think what happened is this: Julia got advertised as ""Python syntax, C speed"" but in practice it turns out to really be ""Python syntax, 50% of C speed if you were willing to avoid some semi-well-documented gotchas, where avoiding said gotchas will take some non-trivial effort"". Again, great if you are willing to work with it.I am not saying that the Julia people are responsible for the ""Python syntax, C speed"" perception as much as that was what the prevalent perception became. AndI have talked to people in computational biology who tried Julia, and they said something or the other similar to ""It just wasn't performant enough for me to give up Python,"" and if you really dig in, what really happened was when new people tried Julia with old mental models, they walked away thinking, ""Heh, more MIT hypeware.""

LLMs don't generalize as well as humans, and sometimes they can have the ability to do tasks without the ability to articulate things that feel essential to the tasks (like answering whether the bicycle is facing left or right).- Secondly, what has made AI labs so bullish on future progress over the past few years is that they see how little work it takes to get their results. Often, if an LLM sucks at something that's because no one worked on it (not always, of course). If you directly train a skill, you can see giant leaps in ability with fairly small effort. Big leaps in SVG creation could be coming from relatively small targeted efforts, where none existed before.

I wouldn't really even call it ""cheating"" since it has improved the model's ability to generate artistic SVG imagery more broadly but the days of this being an effective way to evaluate a model's ""interdisciplinary"" visual reasoning abilities have long since passed, IMO.It's become yet another example in the ever growing list of benchmaxxed targets whose original purpose was defeated by teaching to the test.https://x.com/jeffdean/status/2024525132266688757?s=46&t=ZjF...

But seriously, I can't believe LLMs are able to one-shot a pelican on a bicycle this well. I wouldn't have guessed this was going to emerge as a capability from LLMs 6 years ago. I see why it does now, but... It still amazes me that they're so good at some things.

reply

reply

I have a feeling the most 'emergent' aspect was that LLMs have generally been able to produce coherent SVG for quite a while, likely without specific training at first. Since then I suspect there has been more tailored training because improvements have been so dramatic. Of course it makes sense that text-based images using very distinct structure and properties could be manipulated reasonably well by a text-based language model, but it's still fascinating to me just how well it can work.Perhaps what's most incredible about it is how versatile human language is, even when it lacks so many dimensions as bits on a machine. Yet it's still cool that we can resurrect those bits at rest and transmogrify them back into coherent projections of photons from a screen.I don't think LLMs are AGI or about to completely flip the world upside down or whatever, but it seems undeniably magical when you break it down.

I'm a former Googler and know some people near the team, so I mildly root for them to at least do well, but Gemini is consistently the most frustrating model I've used for development.It's stunningly good at reasoning, design, and generating the raw code, but it just falls over a lot when actually trying to get things done, especially compared to Claude Opus.Within VS Code Copilot Claude will have a good mix of thinking streams and responses to the user. Gemini will almost completely use thinking tokens, and then just do something but not tell you what it did. If you don't look at the thinking tokens you can't tell what happened, but the thinking token stream is crap. It's all ""I'm now completely immersed in the problem..."". Gemini also frequently gets twisted around, stuck in loops, and unable to make forward progress. It's bad at using tools and tries to edit files in weird ways instead of using the provided text editing tools. In Copilot it, won't stop and ask clarifying questions, though in Gemini CLI it will.So I've tried to adopt a plan-in-Gemini, execute-in-Claude approach, but while I'm doing that I might as well just stay in Claude. The experience is just so much better.For as much as I hear Google's pulling ahead, Anthropic seems to be to me, from a practical POV. I hope Googlers on Gemini are actually trying these things out in real projects, not just one-shotting a game and calling it a win.

Most of Gemini's users are Search converts doing extended-Search-like behaviors.Agentic workflows are a VERY small percentage of all LLM usage at the moment.  As that market becomes more important, Google will pour more resources into it.

The model getting it correct or not at any given instance isn't the point, the point is if the model ever gets it wrong we can still assume that it still has some semblance of stochasticity in its output, given that a model is essentially static once it is released.Additionally, hey don't learn post training (except for in context which I think counts as learning to some degree albeit transient), if hypothetically it answers incorrectly 1 in 50 attempts, and I explain in that 1 failed attempt why it is wrong, it will still be a 1-50 chance it gets it wrong in a new instance.This differs from humans, say for example I give an average person the ""what do you put in a toaster"" trick and they fall for it, I can be pretty confident that if I try that trick again 10 years later they will probably not fall for it, you can't really say that for a given model.

I think that's why benchmarking is so hard for me to fully get behind, even if we do it over say, 20 attempts and average it. For a given model, those 20 attempts could have had 5 incredible outcomes and 15 mediocre ones, whereas another model could have 20 consistently decent attempts and the average score would be generally the same.We at least see variance in public benchmarks, but in the internal examples that's almost never the case.

I'm sure I can spend 20-40 more mins to sort this out, but ugh, I don't want to.With alllll that said.. is Gemini 3.1 more agentic now? That's usually where it failed. Very smart and capable models, but hard to apply them? Just me?

Today I have my own private benchmarks, with tests I run myself, with private test cases I refuse to share publicly. These have been built up during the last 1/1.5 years, whenever I find something that my current model struggles with, then it becomes a new test case to include in the benchmark.Nowadays it's as easy as `just bench $provider $model` and it runs my benchmarks against it, and I get a score that actually reflects what I use the models for, and it feels like it more or less matches with actually using the models. I recommend people who use LLMs for serious work to try the same approach, and stop relying on public benchmarks that (seemingly) are all gamed by now.

I am scared some automated system may just decide I am doing something bad and terminate my account. I have been moving important things to Proton, but there are some stuff that I couldn't change that would cause me a lot of annoyance. It's not trivial to set up an alternative account just for Gemini, because my Google account is basically on every device I use.I mostly use LLMs as coding assistant, learning assistant, and general queries (e.g.: It helped me set up a server for self hosting), so nothing weird.

It's absolutely amazing how hostile Google is to releasing billing options that are reasonable, controllable, or even fucking understandable.I want to do relatively simple things like:1. Buy shit from you2. For a controllable amount (ex - let me pick a limit on costs)3. Without spending literally HOURS trying to understand 17 different fucking products, all overlapping, with myriad project configs, api keys that should work, then don't actually work, even though the billing links to the same damn api key page, and says it should work.And frankly - you can't do any of it.  No controls (at best delayed alerts).  No clear access.  No real product differentiation pages.  No guides or onboarding pages to simplify the matter.  No support.  SHIT LOADS of completely incorrect and outdated docs, that link to dead pages, or say incorrect things.So I won't buy shit from them.  Period.

BUT it is not good at all at tool calling and agentic workflows, especially compared to the recent two mini-generations of models (Codex 5.2/5.3, the last two versions of Anthropic models), and also fell behind a bit in  reasoning.I hope they manage to improve things on that front, because then Flash would be great for many tasks.

It's a bit hard to trick reasoning models, because they explore a lot of the angles of a problem, and they might accidentally have an ""a-ha"" moment that leads them on the right path. It's a bit like doing random sampling and stumbling upon the right result after doing gradient descent from those points.

Anthropic seems the best in this. Everything is in the API on day one. OpenAI tend to want to ask you for subscription, but the API gets there a week or a few later. Now, Gemini 3 is not for production use and this is already the previous iteration. So, does Google even intent to release this model?

Until now, I've only ever used Gemini for coding tests. As long as I have access to GPT models or Sonnet/Opus, I never want to use Gemini. Hell, I even prefer Kimi 2.5 over it. I tried it again last week (Gemini Pro 3.0) and, right at the start of the conversation, it made the same mistake it's been making for years: it said ""let me just run this command,"" and then did nothing.My sentiment is actually the opposite of yours: how is Google *not* winning this race?

Just because they have the money doesn't mean that they spend it excessively. OpenAI and Anthropic are both offering coding plans that are possibly severely subsidized, as they are more concerned with growth at all cost, while Google is more concerned with profitability. Google has the bigger warchest and could just wait until the other two run out of money rather than forcing the growth on that product line in unprofitable means.Maybe they are also running much closer to their compute limits then the other ones too and their TPUs are already saturated with API usage.

I honestly do not wish Google to have the best model out there and be forced to use their incomprehensible subscription / billing / project management whatever shit ever again.I don't know what their stuff cost. I don't know why would I use vertex or ai studio. What is included in my subscription what is billed per use.I pray that whatever they build fails and burns.

Google and others at least respects both robots.txt and 429s. They invested years scanning all the internet, so they can now train on what they have stored in their server. OpenAI seems to assume that MY resources are theirs.

You pay for the $20/mo Google AI Pro plan with a credit card via the normal personal billing flow like you would for a Google One plan without any involvement of Google Cloud billing or AI Studio. Authorize in the client with your account and you're good to go.(With the bundled drive storage on AI Pro I'm just paying a few bucks more than I was before so for me it's my least expensive AI subscription excluding the Z.ai ultra cheap plan).Or, just like with Anthropic or OpenAI, it's a separate process for billing/credits for an API key targeted at a developer audience. Which I don't need or use for Gemini CLI or Antigravity at all, it's a one step  ""click link to authorize with your Google Account"" and done.You could decide to use an API key for usage based billing instead (just like you could with Claude Code) but that's entirely unnecessary with a subscription.Sure, for the API anything involving a hyperscalar cloud is going to have a higher complexity floor with legacy cruft here and there, but for individual subscriptions that's irrelevant and it's pretty much as straightforward of a click and pay flow you'd find anywhere else.

I had only started using Opus 4.6 this week. Sonnet it seems like is much better at having a long conversation with. Gemini is good for knowledge retrieval but I think Opus 4.6 has caught up. The biggest thing that made Gemini worth it for me the last 3 months is I crushed it with questions. I wouldn't have even got 10% of the Opus use that I got from Gemini before being made to slow down.I have a deep research going right now on 3.1 for the first time and I honestly have no idea how I am going to tell if it is better than 3.It seems like agentic coding Gemini wasn't as good but just asking it to write a function, I think it only didn't one shot what I asked it twice. Then fixed the problem on the next prompt.I haven't logged in to bother with chatGPT in about 3 months now.

In short, I consider Gemini to be a highly capable intern (grad student level) who is smarter and more tenacious than me, but also needs significant guidance to reach a useful goal.I used Gemini to completely replace the software stack I wrote for my self-built microscope.  That includes:writing a brand new ESP32 console application for controlling all the pins of my ESP32 that drives the LED illuminator.   It wrote the entire ESP-IDF project and did not make any major errors.  I had to guide with updated prompts a few times but otherwise it wrote the entire project from scratch and ran all the build commands, fixing errors along the way.   It also easily made a Python shared library so I can just import this object in my Python code. It saved me ~2-3 days of working through all the ESP-IDF details, and did a better job than I would have.writing a brand new C++-based Qt camera interface (I have a camera with a special SDK that allows controlling strobe and trigger and other details.  It can do 500FPS).  It handled all the concurrency and message passing details.  I just gave it the SDK PDF documentation for the camera (in mixed english/chinese), and asked it to generate an entire project.  I had to spend some time guiding it around making shared libraries but otherwise it wrote the entire project from scratch and I was able to use it to make a GUI to control the camera settings with no additional effort.  It ran all the build commands and fixed errors along the way.  Saved me another 2-3 days and did a better job than I could have.Finally, I had it rewrite the entire microscope stack (python with qt) using the two drivers I described above- along with complex functionality like compositing multiple images during scanning, video recording during scanning, mesaurement tools, computer vision support, and a number of other features.  This involved a lot more testing on my part, and updating prompts to guide it towards my intended destination (fully functional replacement of my original self-written prototype).  When I inspect the code, it definitely did a good job on some parts, while it came up with non-ideal solutions for some problems (for example, it does polling when it could use event-driven callbacks).  This saved literally weeks worth of work that would have been a very tedious slog.From my perspective, it's worked extremely well: doing what I wanted in less time than it would take me (I am a bit of a slow programmer, and I'm doing this in hobby time) and doing a better job (With appropriate guidance) than I could have (even if I'd had a lot of time to work on it).  This greatly enhances my enjoyment of my hobby by doing tedious work, allowing me to spend more time on the interesting problems (tracking tardigrades across a petri dish for hours at a time).  I used gemini pro 3 for this- it seems to do better than 2.5, and flash seemed to get stuck and loop more quickly.I have only lightly used other tools, such as ChatGPT/Codex and have never used Claude.  I tend to stick to the Google ecosystem for several reasons- but mainly, I think they will end up exceeding the capabilities of their competitors, due to their inherent engineering talent and huge computational resources.

I used gemini pro 3 for this- it seems to do better than 2.5, and flash seemed to get stuck and loop more quickly.I have only lightly used other tools, such as ChatGPT/Codex and have never used Claude.  I tend to stick to the Google ecosystem for several reasons- but mainly, I think they will end up exceeding the capabilities of their competitors, due to their inherent engineering talent and huge computational resources.  But they clearly need to catch up in a lot of areas- for example, the VS Code Gemini extension has serious problems (frequent API call errors, messed up formatting of code/text, infinite loops, etc).

The remaining technical challenge I have is related to stage positioning- in my system, it's important that all the image frames we collect are tagged with the correct positions.  Due to some technical challenges, right now the stage positions are slightly out of sync with the frames, which will be a fairly tricky problem to solve.  It's certainly worth trying all the major systems to see what they propose.

In all of them the approach is: this is the solution, now find problems you can apply it to.

Gemini consistently has the best benchmarks but the worst actual real-world results.Every time they announce the best benchmarks I try again at using their tools and products and each time I immediately go back to Claude and Codex models because Google is just so terrible at building actual products.They are good at research and benchmaxxing, but the day to day usage of the products and tools is horrible.Try using Google Antigravity and you will not make it an hour before switching back to Codex or Claude Code, it's so incredibly shitty.

If there's one thing Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest of the Toy Story toys should accept by now, it's the inevitability of change. Facing the unfamiliar has been a running theme since the first film, all the way back in 1995, when the Tom Hanks-voiced cowboy grappled with the arrival of the Tim Allen-voiced astronaut.

Most poignantly, the toys have learned some hard lessons about kids growing up and moving on from their childhood possessions. But how will they react to the intrusion of tech into their low-fi, old-school world? That's what Toy Story 5 aims to find out. A new trailer is here, and it gives us an even better look at “Lilypad,” a new character and terribly modern antagonist voiced by Greta Lee.

Here's the official description from Disney and Pixar: “The toys are back in Disney and Pixar's Toy Story 5, and this time it's Toy meets Tech. Buzz, Woody, Jessie, and the rest of the gang's jobs are challenged when they're introduced to what kids are obsessed with today… electronics!”

Toy Story 5 is written and directed by Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E), co-directed by Kenna Harris, and produced by Lindsey Collins. The main cast includes Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear), Joan Cusack (Jessie), Greta Lee (Lilypad), Conan O'Brien (Smarty Pants), and Tony Hale (Forky).

Newcomers include “Craig Robinson as Atlas, a cheerful talking GPS hippo toy; Shelby Rabara as the excitable camera toy Snappy; Scarlett Spears as the sweet and shy 8-year-old Bonnie; Mykal-Michelle Harris as Blaze, an independent 8-year-old girl who loves animals; and Matty Matheson as the tech-fearing toy Dr. Nutcase,” according to a Pixar press release.

The rest of the cast features “John Ratzenberger as the wisecracking piggybank Hamm; Wallace Shawn as Rex, the anxiety-riddled tyrannosaurus rex toy; Blake Clark as the ever-loyal Slinky Dog; Jeff Bergman as the sarcastic Mr. Potato Head; Anna Vocino as the nurturing Mrs. Potato Head; Annie Potts as the adventure-loving Bo Peep; Bonnie Hunt as the wise rag-doll Dolly; Melissa Villaseñor as Karen Beverly, Bonnie's homemade toy fashioned out of a plastic knife; John Hopkins as the dignified hedgehog plush toy Mr. Pricklepants; Kristen Schaal as the plastic triceratops toy Trixie; Ernie Hudson as the action figure Combat Carl; and Keanu Reeves as Canadian daredevil toy Duke Caboom.”

Toy Story 5 hits theaters June 19.

On February 19, 2025, a Falcon 9 rocket fell back toward Earth in an uncontrolled reentry, producing a massive fireball in the skies over Europe. On its way down, the rocket came near a lidar station in Saxony, Germany, where a team of researchers was able to use the remote-sensing instrument to measure the effect of the rocket reentry on Earth's atmosphere.

“We planned to make the measurement on the chance that we might see something from the re-entry,” Robin Wing, a researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Rostock in Germany, told Gizmodo.

Wing and his colleagues measured a 10-fold concentration of lithium atoms in the upper atmosphere around 20 hours after the uncontrolled re-entry of the Falcon 9 rocket. Increasing amounts of metal, such as lithium, as a byproduct of the modern-day space race, are beginning to alter the chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere. The findings are detailed in a new study published Thursday in Nature.

As spacecraft reenter through the atmosphere, they slowly disintegrate into smaller fragments that burn up and release metals into the upper atmosphere. Lithium, as well as aluminum and other metals used to construct spacecraft, vaporizes during atmospheric re-entry.

The researchers behind the new study chose to measure lithium because it's an effective tracer of space debris pollution and is commonly used in spacecraft. “We discussed several materials, and lithium gave a good compromise of expected signal and challenges in the lidar setup,” Wing said. “We know that lithium is present in the aerospace-grade lithium-aluminum alloys used in spacecraft construction.”

Although the risks of space debris falling onto the ground are well-studied, there is very little known about the effects of falling spacecraft on Earth's upper atmosphere.

Using lidar—a laser-based remote sensing instrument used to measure atmospheric conditions—the team of scientists behind the new study detected a sudden increase in the concentration of lithium atoms, around 10 times the baseline value found in the atmosphere, on February 20, 2025. This lithium plume stretched from around 58 to 60 miles (94 to 97 kilometers) above sea level.

The researchers observed the plume for 27 minutes until data recording stopped. They then traced the plume of pollution to the Falcon 9 reentry, linking its area of origin to the uncontrolled path taken by the rocket on its way down.

The recent study focuses on the amount of lithium left behind from a single rocket reentry. Previous studies have already shown that lithium, aluminum, copper, and lead left behind from the reentry of spacecraft already exceeds the cosmic dust influx of those metals to the atmosphere.

It's not clear yet how exactly this change in the atmospheric chemistry would affect life on Earth, but the researchers behind the new study believe that there is enough reason for concern. Still, more research is needed to narrow down the impact on our planet.

“There are many elements present inside spacecraft which are not very present in our atmosphere due to natural causes,” Wing said. “We know very little about what metals actually exist in the atmosphere and how that relates to re-entry pollution.”

Around 500 years ago, four young girls in South America were bashed in the head and sacrificed in a gruesome Inca ritual.

Researchers have conducted CT scans of their mummified remains, previously found high up on modern-day Peru's Ampato and Sara Sara volcanoes. The team's archaeological results, described in a study published in January in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, provide rare direct evidence of the grisly ritual.

The Inca were a powerful South American pre-Columbian civilization most commonly known for its construction of Machu Picchu. The empire lasted from the end of the 1200s to 1572, and many Peruvians today descend from these indigenous people.

The four children were sacrificed in an Inca ritual called capacocha, “one of the most significant ceremonial rituals of the Inca Empire,” Socha and her colleagues wrote in the study. It was associated with the imperial court, natural disasters, seasonal celebrations, and ethnic relocations. “The capacocha children served as representatives of their living communities before the deities,” they added.

While historical sources portray these rituals, few actual capacocha victims have come to light. As such, the remains of the four children—Ampato #1, Ampato #2, Ampato #4, and Sara Sara (each named after the volcano where they were found)—provide a rare opportunity for direct investigation, as well as the possibility of verifying these historical texts.

CT scans of Ampato #1, also known as the Lady of Ampato, unveiled injuries in her cranium and the areas of her pelvis and chest. The trauma to the head and pelvis would have been deadly. She died at around 14 years old, her body naturally mummified from the freezing conditions. Her remains were discovered along with little bags of corn, pottery fragments, and figurines.

Ampato #2 met her ritual end when she was around eight years old, also via a terrible head injury. Notably, the CT analyses suggested she had lasting health issues, challenging historical texts indicating the kinds of children that were sacrificed.

“Our findings show that chroniclers' accounts should be treated with caution. Although historical sources describe the children as physically perfect and without flaws, modern scientific analyses reveal a very different reality,” Dagmara Socha, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Warsaw's Centre for Andean Studies and co-author of the study, tells Gizmodo. “This may reflect the general living conditions within the Inca Empire, but it may also indicate that European chroniclers did not fully understand what the Incas themselves considered ‘ideal.'”

Ampato #4, who died at around 10 years old from a (you guessed it) deadly head injury, also revealed something surprising: It appears that her body was intentionally modified after she died and may have even been buried twice. The team identified rocks and pieces of textiles in her abdominal cavity and some missing bones. That makes Ampato #4 the first deliberately mummified capacocha victim known to science.

But the chronicles did seem to get some things right. Ampato #4 was likely killed in one place before being moved to another, a custom that aligns with the Inca Empire's resettlement of populations, which we know from historical sources. These relocated groups hauled along ritually significant items, including mummies of their ancestors, and Ampato #4 may have been one of these important pieces of baggage.

The study provides “the first direct evidence that the role of children sacrificed in the capacocha ritual did not end with their death. Until now, similar information was known mainly from colonial chronicles describing the mummies of deceased rulers and aristocrats. For example, Pedro Pizarro [a conquistador] wrote that living people visited [mummies] to seek approval for marriage,” Socha explained. Ampato #4's mummification “shows that children sacrificed during capacocha may have played a similar role in the religious life of provincial communities.”

As for the Sara Sara mummy, she was around 14 years old and experienced cranial injuries comparable to Ampato #1, which means she was probably also a victim of a capacocha. Her remains were naturally mummified and also revealed similar health issues to Ampato #2.

The study ultimately sheds light on a practice whose knowledge has mostly reached us indirectly, highlighting the importance of direct archaeological evidence. Writers 500 years ago, just like those of us today, can get things wrong. It's just harder for them to issue redactions.

The global rise in nearsightedness has largely been attributed to our phone addiction, but researchers now suggest that incessant scrolling is not solely to blame.

A team of scientists from the SUNY College of Optometry found that dim indoor lighting, combined with prolonged, up-close focus, may be straining the eyes. The study, published in Cell Reports, suggests that myopia, or nearsightedness, is not aggravated solely by the use of personal devices.

Nearsightedness has been rapidly increasing across the world, with current estimates suggesting that it will affect nearly 50% of the global population by 2050. Shortsighted people have slightly stretched eyeballs, making it difficult to focus on distant objects.

Although the increasing number of shortsighted people has largely been linked to excessive use of our phones, the new study suggests it's not that simple. Instead, focusing on objects up close in low-light environments strains the retina.

“In bright outdoor light, the pupil constricts to protect the eye while still allowing ample light to reach the retina,” Urusha Maharjan, SUNY Optometry doctoral student and lead author of the study, said in a statement. “When people focus on close objects indoors, such as phones, tablets, or books, the pupil can also constrict, not because of brightness, but to sharpen the image. In dim lighting, this combination may significantly reduce retinal illumination.”

Prolonged focus on objects in dim lighting further enhances this pupil constriction, especially for people who are already nearsighted.

Myopia may develop when insufficient light reaches the retina during prolonged close focus in dim indoor environments, according to the new study. When the light is too dim, it causes the pupils to narrow excessively at short viewing distances, making it difficult to develop normal vision.

On the other hand, in brightly lit environments, the pupil constricts in response to light rather than focusing distance, maintaining healthy stimulation of the retina.

The theory is speculative and requires further testing to confirm. If it holds up, however, it could have significant implications for preventing nearsightedness. “This is not a final answer,” Jose-Manuel Alonso, a professor at SUNY and co-author of the study, said in a statement. “But the study offers a testable hypothesis that reframes how visual habits, lighting, and eye focusing interact.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly made note of reading glasses. The condition described here is myopia, which requires glasses for distance.

Walk into any modern AI data center, and you'll immediately be hit in the face by heat. Even before you've set your eyes on the racks, you feel the output of rows upon rows of servers pushing air through increasingly dense racks that were never designed for processors drawing the sheer power needed to run huge AI models. Multiply that across dense training clusters, and the thermal envelope becomes one of today's greatest engineering constraints.

Now, according to reporting by the South China Morning Post, China is accelerating investments in liquid cooling technology. Dozens of Chinese companies — including Envicool, whose shares have more than tripled over the past year — have announced plans to expand into liquid-cooling systems to prevent AI racks from overheating. With thermal envelopes riding, this isn't a problem unique to Chinese data centers, either.

Since 2022, Beijing has pushed its “Eastern Data, Western Computing” strategy, which shifts data processing toward western provinces with access to renewable energy. According to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the country has already built 42 “10,000-card” intelligent computing clusters, with total capacity exceeding 1,590 exaflops. Those clusters aren't populated with low-power CPUs but built around high-end AI accelerators that concentrate enormous heat loads into increasingly compact footprints.

 






As an example, Nvidia's B200 operates at more than 1,000 watts per processor, and its GB200 NVL72 rack-scale platform, which integrates 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs, ships in a liquid-cooled configuration as standard and out of necessity.

As chip thermal design power continues to climb, air cooling faces two limits. First, the volumetric heat capacity of air constrains how much thermal energy can be removed per unit time without driving airflow and energy use to impractical levels. Secondly, high airflow requirements complicate rack density and overall facility design. At multi-kilowatt per rack densities, these air-cooled systems become increasingly inefficient.

Liquid, by contrast, offers orders of magnitude higher heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Direct-to-chip cold plates circulate coolant through sealed loops attached to processors, removing heat at the source. More aggressive approaches, including immersion and spray cooling, place components in direct contact with dielectric fluids. This has created an all-new bill of materials consisting of cold plates, manifolds, leak-detection systems, and cooling distribution units, among other components.

Global suppliers like Vertiv are prominent in this stack, but Chinese firms are racing to localize capabilities. Envicool, whose customers include Nvidia, Alibaba, and Tencent, has become one of the most obvious domestic players, with Goldman Sachs and UBS both raising price targets on its stock, citing demand tied to AI and energy efficiency.

 




China's tilt towards liquid cooling isn't driven solely by chip thermals, though. Its national energy and carbon reduction policies impose explicit power usage effectiveness targets on data centers. Power Usage Effeciveness (PUE) is the ratio of total facility energy to IT equipment energy, and becomes harder to optimize as cooling overhead rises. Liquid systems, by reducing fan loads and enabling higher coolant temperatures, can materially improve overall efficiency.

Despite offering renewable energy resources, the country's western provinces lack the legacy data center infrastructure found in the coastal regions. Building greenfield AI campuses allows operators to design around liquid cooling from the get-go, rather than retrofitting air-cooled facilities. That design freedom will reduce friction in adopting direct-to-chip or immersion cooling architectures at the scale China needs.

Meanwhile, Chinese hyperscalers downstream are piling on the demand pressure. Their model sizes are growing, and their training runs stretch across thousands of accelerators, thereby making thermal reliability a serious performance variable because any temperature gradients across racks can affect clock speeds and error rates.

The narrative around AI hardware has centered on GPUs and memory for years, and now cooling is joining that list. Vendors that can deliver integrated rack-scale solutions that combine accelerators, networking, and liquid thermal management will gain an edge in both deployment speed and operational efficiency.

Vertiv, an Ohio-based data center infrastructure provider, recently reported net sales of about $13.5 billion. It's also a partner of Nvidia, placing it directly in the path of Blackwell deployments. Chinese counterparts are understood to be pursuing similar alignments within domestic supply chains, particularly as export controls will continue to complicate access to certain U.S. components.

Ultimately, the question is not whether liquid cooling will become the default for AI infrastructure, but how quickly. With Blackwell-class GPUs exceeding 1,000 watts and rack platforms consolidating dozens of these components, air cooling appears increasingly confined to lower-density inference workloads. Even there, analysts expect liquid adoption to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in training clusters.

Returning to China — “10,000-card” clusters pushing 1,590 exaflops will mean that even marginal gains in cooling efficiency via liquid cooling could translate into significant energy savings and better overall stability. China just needs to establish an entire supply chain to achieve it.

In a respite from the ever-increasing cost of PC hardware and accessories, Dell has released a brand new gaming monitor for less than $130. At this price point, outside of a sale, you can typically expect low refresh rates and aging hardware. This Dell SE2726HG monitor bucks the trend – it's a 27-inch monitor with an ultra-fast 240Hz refresh rate, and all for an introductory sale price of just $129.99 right now.

This is a 1080p monitor, so you're capped at a resolution of just 1,920 x 1,080 using the SE2726HG. As we've consistently seen from the data collected by the Steam hardware survey, that resolution continues to be used by the majority of gamers today – there's a market for cheaper 1080p displays, even in the era of big 4K OLEDs.

Which leads us to this Dell 27-inch SE2726HG monitor. The stand-out feature on this display is the 240Hz refresh rate, which is rarely seen at this price, and leaves plenty of room to keep up with your GPU's output in any fast-paced games you might play. It ships with a 27-inch IPS panel, a good all-round choice on LCD monitors these days, as it typically offers the best viewing angles.

Other features on this display include two HDMI 2.1 ports, along with a single DisplayPort 1.4 connection. That leaves flexibility to connect this monitor up to your PC, laptop, and handheld at the same time. The display uses a tilt-capable mount, so you do have flexibility to adjust its position, but if you want a height-adjustable stand included, you can with the otherwise-identical Dell SE2726HGS, albeit at the higher price of $169.99.

The budget-friendly SE2726HG, meanwhile, has a max brightness of 300 nits. It also has a standard response time of 5 ms, but this can (reportedly) be reduced to just 0.5ms by switching to the display's ‘extreme' mode in the settings. AMD FreeSync Premium support is included, too, to eliminate screen tearing completely, which is a nice feature on a budget-focused monitor. Nvidia G-Sync support isn't mentioned, but you'll often find the two work interchangeably when one or the other is supported on a display, although we can't confirm that here.

Priced at just $129.99, this 27-inch Dell SE2726HGS gaming monitor is a strong entry into the market, with a very affordable price that puts it in a strong position against its competitors. This monitor would be a good option for a budget gaming PC build, especially if you're not looking to reach 1440p or 4K visuals, or as a second (or third) monitor to complement your main display.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a method to predict when someone is likely to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease using a single blood test.

In a new study published Feb. 19 in Nature Medicine, the researchers demonstrated that their models predicted the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms within a margin of three to four years. This could have implications both for clinical trials developing preventive Alzheimer's treatments and for eventually identifying individuals likely to benefit from these treatments.

More than 7 million Americans live with Alzheimer's disease, with health and long-term care costs for Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia projected to reach nearly $400 billion in 2025, according to the Alzheimer's Association. This massive public health burden currently has no cure, but predictive models could help efforts to develop treatments that prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms.

Our work shows the feasibility of using blood tests, which are substantially cheaper and more accessible than brain imaging scans or spinal fluid tests, for predicting the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms.""

Suzanne E. Schindler, MD, PhD, senior author, associate professor in the WashU Medicine Department of Neurology

Schindler noted that these models could allow clinical trials of potentially preventive treatments to be performed within a shorter time period.

""In the near term, these models will accelerate our research and clinical trials,"" she said. ""Eventually, the goal is to be able to tell individual patients when they are likely to develop symptoms, which will help them and their doctors to develop a plan to prevent or slow symptoms.""

The study was part of a project developed and launched by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium, a public-private partnership of which WashU Medicine is a member.

The models that Schindler and her colleagues developed use a protein called p-tau217 in an individual's plasma, the liquid part of the blood, to estimate the age when they will begin experiencing symptoms of the neurodegenerative disease. Levels of p-tau217 in the plasma can currently be used to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer's in patients with cognitive impairment. These tests are not currently recommended in cognitively unimpaired individuals outside of clinical trials or research.

To identify the interval between elevated p-tau217 levels and Alzheimer's symptoms, Schindler and lead author Kellen K. Petersen, PhD, an instructor in neurology at WashU Medicine, analyzed data from volunteers in two independent long-running Alzheimer's research initiatives: the WashU Medicine Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), based at multiple sites in the U.S. The participants included 603 older adults who lived independently in the community.

Plasma p-tau217 was measured with PrecivityAD2, a clinically available diagnostic blood test for Alzheimer's disease from C2N Diagnostics, a WashU startup co-founded by WashU Medicine researchers David M. Holtzman, MD, the Barbara Burton and Reuben M. Morriss III Distinguished Professor, and Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. & Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology, both coauthors on the study. Plasma p-tau217 was also measured in the ADNI cohort using blood tests from other companies, including one cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Plasma p-tau217 has previously been shown to correlate strongly with the accumulation of amyloid and tau in the brain as shown on PET scans. The key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid and tau are misfolded proteins that begin building up in the brain many years before Alzheimer's symptoms develop.

""Amyloid and tau levels are similar to tree rings - if we know how many rings a tree has, we know how many years old it is,"" Petersen said. ""It turns out that amyloid and tau also accumulate in a consistent pattern and the age they become positive strongly predicts when someone is going to develop Alzheimer's symptoms. We found this is also true of plasma p-tau217, which reflects both amyloid and tau levels.""

The models predicted the age of symptom onset within a margin of error of three to four years. Older individuals had a shorter time from when elevated p-tau217 appeared to the start of symptoms as compared to younger participants, suggesting that younger people's brains may be more resilient to neurodegeneration and that older people may develop symptoms at lower levels of Alzheimer's pathology. For example, if a person had elevated p-tau217 in their plasma at age 60, they developed symptoms 20 years later. If p-tau217 wasn't elevated until age 80, they developed symptoms only 11 years later.

The team found that their predictive model worked with the other p-tau217-based diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease besides PrecivityAD2, illustrating the robustness and generalizability of their approach.

The authors shared all code for development of the models so that other researchers can further refine the models. Additionally, Petersen developed a web-based application allowing researchers to explore the clock models in greater detail.

""These clock models could make clinical trials more efficient by identifying individuals who are likely to develop symptoms within a certain period of time,"" Petersen said. ""With further refinement, these methodologies have the potential to predict symptom onset accurately enough that we could use it in individual clinical care.""

Petersen added that additional blood biomarkers are associated with cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's; as a direction for future research, these could be used to refine the estimates of symptom onset.

Deborah Abiodun, Gift Monday and Super Falcons to take on Cameroon in pre-WAFCON friendlies

Washington, D.C. (02/19/2026) – Washington Spirit midfielder Deborah Abiodun and forward Gift Monday have been called up to the Nigeria Women's National Team for the federation's upcoming friendlies against Cameroon, the Nigeria Football Federation announced today. The side will visit Yaoundé, the Cameroonian capital city, for both friendlies. 

Abiodun made her debut for the Nigeria senior team in September 2022 and has since competed with the side at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2024 Olympic Games. Since joining the Spirit in August 2025, the midfielder has appeared in 12 matches, tallying a goal and an assist. 

Monday first appeared for the Super Falcons in 2021 and has since played in over ten matches for the side, being part of Nigeria's 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup squad as well. Since joining the Spirit early last season, Monday has appeared in 28 matches for Washington, tallying 11 goals and two assists. 

Nigeria's March Friendly Schedule: 

The Spirit will look to build on the side's second consecutive NWSL Championship appearance in 2026. The team will kick off the regular season at home on Friday, March 13 when it hosts Portland Thorns FC in a rematch of last season's thrilling home semifinal. Information on 2026 season ticket memberships is available HERE.

Rabat—UEFA is reportedly now prepared to support FIFA's proposal to expand the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup to 48 teams. This is a huge shift, especially after years of tension where both sides were constantly at odds over international calendar congestion and how much football players could actually handle. 

The breakthrough came after negotiations in February, where both sides finally found some common ground. FIFA will keep the tournament on a four-year cycle. By sticking to a four-year schedule, FIFA effectively buried the “biennial” dream which was an idea long opposed by UEFA. For them, this was a huge win, as it removes the direct threat to the Champions League's status as the world's top club competition.

UEFA will not oppose the expansion of the Club World Cup to 48 teams. The agreement was made possible after FIFA committed to keeping the tournament on its current four-year cycle, ruling out the idea of holding it every two years.

With this understanding, UEFA is expected to… pic.twitter.com/6QiQTSZJ6z

Under the proposed expansion, Europe would receive 16 slots, up from 12 in the current 32-team format. The increase acts as a safety net for European clubs, as it would widen access for the big ones that previously failed to qualify, including powerhouses such as Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United. 

More interestingly, African football could be represented by 6 or 7 clubs. A big opportunity for the continent.

For UEFA, the additional places mitigate competitive and commercial risks. For FIFA, broader European representation strengthens broadcast value and global appeal.

The map for the 2029 host is also starting to pull together. Spain and Morocco have jumped to the front of the line to co-host, which would turn the expanded Club World Cup into the last test. It's the perfect chance for them to test their operations on a huge scale just one year before they team up with Portugal for the 2030 World Cup

Despite the UEFA-FIFA alignment, opposition has not disappeared. The World Leagues Association and players' union FIFPRO continue to push back, arguing that further expansion intensifies player workload and increases injury risk in an already saturated calendar.

The proposal is headed for the FIFA Council's desk later this year for the final stamp of approval. If it's approved, this should be a total transformation of the game and probably the most significant structural change in global club football since the competition's modern relaunch.

World Cup

 Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has suggested that every match for the 2026 men's World Cup will be sold out and claimed FIFA have received requests for over one million tickets per game for 77 of the 104 matches during the tournament in North America.

The games will be played in June and July this summer across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Advertisement

On Wednesday, Infantino appeared as a guest at the World Liberty Forum hosted at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. World Liberty Financial, who convened the invite-only business conference, is co-founded by President Trump and his three sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron are also among the co-founders.

The conference included appearances from business leaders, senators and investors, with Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali speaking alongside AC Milan's owner Gerry Cardinale, while artist Nicki Minaj also appeared. During the event, Infantino was spotted wearing a USA baseball cap with the numbers 45 and 47 etched into the side, representing Trump's two periods as President.

In a subsequent interview with CNBC, Infantino provided details on the progress of FIFA's controversial ticketing policy for the World Cup, with record-high prices branded by supporters groups as a “monumental betrayal”, while also bringing criticism from politicians including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani.

He repeated FIFA's claim, which cannot be independently verified, that the organization has received “requests for over 500 million tickets — 508 million, to be precise — for around 7 million tickets that we have on sale.”

FIFA has sought to resist suggestions that many of these requests may be bots, claiming that every request was “validated by unique credit card data.”

For the first time, Infantino also provided insight into more granular data, although he did not clarify the full spread of requests across games.

Asked if he is concerned that high ticket prices risk alienating supporters, Infantino replied: “It's not a problem in the sense that the demand is there. We have 104 matches in total, which if you look at the audience figures, six billion people will watch these matches. Obviously the price is a consequence of that and 77 out of these 104 matches have received requests for over 1 million tickets. Every match is already sold out. We keep some tickets back for some last minute sales, of course, but every match is sold out.”

When asked by The Athletic to clarify how, exactly, games can be sold out if tickets are being held for later sales, a FIFA source indicated that Infantino had misspoke and that he was instead meaning to say that FIFA expect all the games to sell out. They were also unable to immediately clarify Infantino's calculations when he claimed an audience of six billion for the World Cup — the global population is eight billion.

Infantino said he expected FIFA revenues from the tournament to exceed $11 billion, while claiming that the U.S. economy will receive $30 billion in economic impact, but such studies are often treated with skepticism. FIFA stands to profit not only from initial sales but also from resales on its own platform, where it will charge 15 per cent commissions on both the seller and buyer, meaning it would make $30 from the sale of a $100 ticket.

Infantino claimed FIFA had received requests from “over 200 countries in the world.”

He said: “Everyone wants to come here and everyone wants to be part of something special. People generally want to experience some emotions and be part of something happy and feel something special. All these requests coming from all over the world show that people want to come, celebrate, have fun and — they are all a little bit, maybe tired and fed up of all this negativity that is portrayed the whole time, right? We need some good news and some good things.”

Infantino, who flew into Miami on a Qatari private jet earlier this week, also spent time in the Trump orbit on Thursday, where he was an attendee at a Board of Peace event hosted by the U.S. president. The body, founded and led by Trump, has so far been shunned by America's allies in NATO, but nations including Hungary, Israel, Belarus, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Argentina and Turkey have joined.

Infantino has previously hailed Trump's foreign policy, even presenting him with FIFA's inaugural Peace Prize during the World Cup draw in December.

Later that month, an official complaint was submitted to FIFA's Ethics Committee by FairSquare, a non-profit organization and advocacy group which focuses mainly on global labor migration rights, political repression and sport. It alleged “repeated breaches” of FIFA's duty of political neutrality by Infantino, while also requesting an investigation into the process that saw Trump receive the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize.

PHILADELPHIA - The first whistle may blow in July, but SEPTA has already been laying the groundwork to move thousands of soccer fans across Philadelphia when the World Cup comes to town.

What we know:

Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field (temporarily renamed ""Philadelphia Stadium"" for the tournament) will host six FIFA World Cup 2026 matches between June 14 and July 4, including five group-stage games and a Round of 16 knockout match — coinciding with the United States' 250th anniversary.

SEPTA says it has been preparing for World Cup crowds from both service and infrastructure perspectives since last year, well ahead of match days. Improvements have focused on key travel points, such as City Hall and NRG stations.

Infrastructure upgrades include signal and track work, painting, new signage, improved lighting, accessibility enhancements and installation of new fare gates.


    Featured
  

Philadelphia is one of the U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and fans across the region have learned which teams will be visiting the City of Brotherly Love for the group stage matchups.

To handle the expected influx of fans traveling to and from matches — particularly at Lincoln Financial Field — SEPTA will adjust service levels on key routes and deploy ambassadors at major stations across the system to assist riders.

Officials also say they are coordinating with city leaders and event organizers on finalized service plans, expected to be completed by spring. More details will be posted on SEPTA.org as the tournament approaches.

Why you should care:

With Philadelphia hosting games featuring some of the biggest names in international soccer and welcoming thousands of visitors into the city, transportation demand is expected to surge on match days — making transit planning and infrastructure readiness critical to keeping crowds moving smoothly.

Piers Morgan led the Arsenal fury on social media on Wednesday night after Mikel Arteta's side squandered a 2-0 lead at Wolves to draw in the 94th minute with the Premier League's bottom side at Molineux. Gunners fan Morgan fumed that his side are ""choking again"" as they failed to extend their lead over Manchester City, who could go to within two points of the summit if they win their game in hand.

The Gunners had led since the fifth minute against their West Midlands opponents, who remain rock-bottom of the Premier League with minimal chances of survival. Goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapie put Arsenal firmly in control, but Hugo Bueno got one back with a left-footed curler from the edge of the box before Tom Edozie equalised for 2-2 in the dying seconds just ten minutes into his professional debut, following a huge defensive mix-up involving David Raya and Gabriel.

Arteta's side remain top of the table, currently five points ahead of Manchester City, who have a game in hand. This result puts all the more pressure on the meeting between the two sides at the Etihad in April, an all-too familiar position following their previous title showdowns with the Cityzens. Twice in the past under Arteta, Arsenal have led the table in the spring only to be chased down and beaten to the crown by Pep Guardiola's City. Morgan was not alone in fearing the worst after their latest fatal slip-up.

Morgan led the Arsenal fury following the result on social media, posting to his 8.7 million followers on X: “FFS. What are you doing, Arsenal?”

He added: “We're choking. Again.”

The following day on Thursday morning, Morgan wrote: “Not good enough. If you want to be champions @Arsenal then wake the f*** up before it's too late. Last night's second half performance was worst I've seen for years. I excuse @_DeclanRice who showed the standard of drive/intensity the other players must meet.”

Another fan added: “One thing about Arsenal? We will prove the haters right every single time.”

While a third chimed: “If we're not good enough, we're not good enough and you just have to deal with it, life sucks.”

While devastated from what he had seen unfold late on at Molineux, Arsenal manager Arteta told reporters that his side must remain focused on the task at hand.

He said: ""Extremely disappointed, obviously, with the result, with the way the game ended, but we have to blame ourselves.

""I think the performance in the second half didn't show anything close to the standards that are required in this league to win, with the margin that I think should have existed today, especially in the manner that we played the first half. It's a moment of disappointment.

""We all want to talk a lot about how we're feeling, but it's not the moment to do that, because anything that we do has to always and only be with the intention to help the team. Right now I think we have to swallow that frustration. When you are at this level and at the top, you need to take the hit, because today we deserve them as well, and move on as quickly as possible, because on Sunday we have a big game coming up.""

Wednesday night might ultimately prove a turning point in the title race, but all is not lost with 11 matches left and everything still in Arsenal's hands. If the Gunners win all their remaining matches including avoiding defeat at the Etihad, they will be crowned champions. But dropped points have meant a lead of six points has been cut to what would be two if City win their game in hand against Crystal Palace.

Arsenal's next task is an eye-catching one – a North London Derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday afternoon, against a Tottenham side buoyed by the appointment of new head coach Igor Tudor and knowing they can play a direct role in their greatest rivals' fate.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Arne Slot delivers promising Alexander Isak injury update as Liverpool striker targets return","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/arne-slot-promising-alexander-isak-injury-update-liverpool-striker-return/bltbd2f8d7cfc059016","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:00:47 GMT","

Arne Slot has delivered a promising update on Alexander Isak, with a potential return date for the Swedish striker being pencilled in. Isak, who is the Reds' record signing, was forced to undergo surgery after suffering a broken leg against Tottenham on December 20. His campaign has not become a complete write off, with positive progress being made through a rehabilitation programme.

Isak cost Liverpool a British transfer record £125 million ($168m) when moving to Anfield from Newcastle in the summer of 2025. Having arrived on Merseyside without a pre-season campaign behind him, the 26-year-old striker was forever playing catch-up on the fitness front.

He eventually broke down when finding himself on the receiving end of a full-blooded tackle from Spurs defender Micky van de Ven. Isak suffered fibula and ankle fractures, leading to him going under the knife.

Having spent two months on the sidelines, Isak has stepped up his recovery by making a return to light training. He will be eased back into the first-team fold, with no unnecessary risks being taken.

Slot has, however, hinted at a recall being a matter of weeks away, telling reporters: “Alex has been on the pitch, not with his football boots, but with his running shoes for the first time this week, so that will take a while as well.

“Let's not put a timescale on it, but it's clear he will be available if things go as planned this season. It will be some time around there, the end of March, start of April, when he is hopefully back with the group, but that's not to say you're ready to play, let alone start a game

“I'm not sure if I'm educating you, but before they go on the pitch, it's not like they're lying in bed 24 hours a day. They come to the training ground, do their gym work and rehab.

“It's nice for him to go on the pitch, it's nice for us to see him here, because there's still enough work to be done but you know as a player, you arrive in the final stages of your rehab. As long as you're in the gym and not the pitch, that's not the nicest part.

“The next step is doing work with the ball, which every player likes the most. The next step is to come into the group and then it takes a while before you're ready to play. But it's nice that the rehab goes well - that's a compliment to him and our medical staff.”

Isak registered just three goals through 16 appearances prior to being laid low, but Liverpool expect value for money to be found in the Swede once he is fully up to speed.

Slot has said when asked if a proven Premier League performer needs more support in order to produce his best: “It's been a really challenging and difficult period for him, I think.

“You join a new club and usually when you join a new club you are, and he was of course, very excited and you want to show immediately all the qualities you have but that was simply impossible.

“Maybe no-one understands but if you haven't trained for three or four months on a serious level with the team and you're playing in this league… in this league you need to be on the top of your game to impact a game of football.

“That took, which we all knew, months before we could bring him there because there was no pre-season, there were games, games, games.

“We had hardly any time to train, so we always knew that it would take him time and that's why he is so unlucky that he is now injured because I think we all saw with his goal against West Ham, with this goal [against Tottenham], that he got closer and closer to the player he was at Newcastle.”

Isak could make a timely return as Liverpool reach the business end of their endeavours in 2025-26. Slot's side remain in the hunt for FA Cup and Champions League honours, while also chasing down a top-four finish. They will be back in Premier League action on Sunday when taking in a trip to Nottingham Forest.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The bidding war for the Brie Larson creature feature helped prop up a stable, but less than spectacular 2026 European Film Market.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Berlin's European Film Market ended with a bang.


	Sony Pictures won a bidding war to take worldwide rights for Skeletons. The creature feature, about a young boy who discovers a disturbing secret about his mother's true nature, stars Brie Larson and will be produced by JJ Abrams and directed by Strange Darling filmmaker JT Mollner (he also wrote the recent Stephen King adaptation The Long Walk).




	Sony outbid fellow studios Warner Bros. and Paramount, as well as indie powerhouse Neon for the title, which FilmNation, CAA and WME were selling at EFM. The deal was reportedly pegged at $25 million.

	It was the biggest reported deal, by far, out of EFM this year, which was otherwise quiet, though productive, according to sales and acquisition execs. The bulk of business, as always for Berlin, was in international pre-buys — Neon picked up Clarissa, the new feature from twin filmmakers' Arie and Chuko Esiri (This Is My Desire), which stars Sophie Okonedo, David Oyelowo, and Ayo Edebiri, and is billed as a modern, Nigerian-set take on Virginia Woolf's classic novel Mrs. Dalloway, also snatching up international sales rights for the title.


	But there were also few domestic pick-ups, including of Sundance hit Josephine, a psychological family drama starring Channing Tatum, Gemma Chan and newcomer Mason Reeves, which new domestic distributor Sumerian Pictures acquired in a competitive seven-figure deal.

	











	The Berlin boom days, when multiple $100 million plus projects sold out worldwide within the first few days of the market, are ancient history. But after years of contraction, shrinking pre-sales and skittish buyers, there was a sense at EFM, a cautious, qualified sense, that the worst may be over.


	“We've hit rock bottom, there's nowhere to go but up,” quipped one major European buyer.


	The packages on offer in Berlin were smaller, with lower star wattage and tighter budgets and cheap horror titles were predominant. But there are signs of life — particularly from the U.S., where a new crop of independent distributors — Black Bear, Row K, Subtext — is stepping into the void left by studio retrenchment and the upscaling of indie heavyweights Neon and A24.


	“A year ago [U.S. distribution] was feeling pretty, pretty tough,” says Zach Glueck, co-CEO of Manifest Pictures, the new U.S. sales outfit he launched in January together with Yvette Zhuang. “But just the fact that we have so many recent entries into the space, you have to hope they are identifying a gap in the market. We'll see how the releases go, but it's good to see froth in that space, hopefully their success can drive their competitors to have to be more aggressive to pick up films and release films.”


	International, however, is where the real money is. The global theatrical business has recovered faster, post-COVID, than the domestic market, and in most major international territories, there is still healthy competition, with multiple large and mid-sized buyers able to bid on buzz titles.

	











	“Over the last couple of years in the independent space, international has been the bedrock of getting independent cinema greenlit,” notes Glueck. “It's put a tremendous amount of weight on the international markets and the international buyers to get these films off the ground.”


	Glueck says the sweet spot is clear: “The kind of middle lane of films that we want to be identifying are strong genre pieces with a good hook, but that really have a core genre element that can be very easily understood and very easily marketed to a global audience. So — romances, action thrillers, erotic thrillers. Buyers are really looking for a big, broad comedy with stars. There's a real value to finding directors or creatives with a track record, especially for pre-buying.”


	But making indie movies is not getting any easier. Streamers and pay-TV outlets are buying less, and paying less, for movies, removing a comfortable backstop that allowed distributors to take bigger risks, safe in the knowledge they could make their money back on ancillaries.


	“It's become harder for the mid-market movies, the pre-sales, on average, have dropped significantly. The bottom has dropped out,” says Maximilian Leo of German production group Augenschein, whose feature The Weight, starring Ethan Hawke and Russell Crowe, premiered out of competition in Berlin.


	To fill the gap, producers are leaning harder than ever on public support. “In this market, state subsidies and soft money have become more important to get films made,” notes Leo.

	











	Adds Manifest Pictures Co-CEO Yvette Zhuang: “Nowadays, pretty much every single project relies on tax credits or incentives from a state or country to meet its budget.”


	A handful of bigger titles did cut through in Berlin. 


	In addition to Skeletons, there was major buzz around Mister, an action comedy from Black Bear and CAA Media Finance starring Walton Goggins and Chloë Grace Moretz, marking the directorial debut of stunt and second unit veteran Wade Eastwood (Mission: Impossible – Fallout). A24 rose about the horror crowd with October, a Halloween-set action horror from Rebel Ridge and Green Room filmmaker Jeremy Saulnier starring Cory Michael Smith, Chase Sui Wonders and Sophie Wilde. And 193 launched sales on Hello & Paris, a rom-com pairing Javier Bardem and Kate Hudson for director Elizabeth Chomko.


	Outside the U.S., local-language films continue to underpin the ecosystem, making distributors less reliant on American titles. The biggest non-studio movies in Europe last year were local-language comedies, including the Italian hit Buen Camino, which grossed $90 million domestically, and Germany's Western spoof Manitou's Canoe with a $57 million local haul.


	“We are seeing a really active European market, strong European films are doing very well,” says Andrea Scrosati, group COO and CEO Continental Europe for Fremantle, which owns several boutique European production companies, including Ireland's Element Pictures (Bugonia, Pillion), and Italy's Wildside (Conclave, After the Hunt) and The Apartment (Challengers, Berlin competition title Rosebush Pruning).

	











	Those local successes don't necessarily translate internationally, but they stabilize national industries and sustain buyer confidence.


	In Berlin this year, that confidence was present, if fragile. Sellers report cautious buyers taking ever longer to do deals, waiting to see footage, or a finished film, before committing. Or waiting for festival reviews and audience reaction before signing. But the existential crisis that rocked the indie business over the past few years appears to be over. The new normal might not be tentpole titles and 9-figure sales, but it's a living.

How the artist worked with promoter Live Nation to make the fan experience as seamless, and satisfying, as possible.


													By
												

	Lyndsey Havens



	In early February, Noah Kahan announced an impressive North American stadium tour in support of his upcoming fourth album, The Great Divide – and it's already sold out. Equally impressive: the measures Kahan and his team have taken to ensure that tickets ended up in the hands of fans – and for face value. 


	“Selling out his first stadium run this quickly speaks to the deep connection he's built with fans through both his music and his live show,” says Michael Yerke, a global tour promoter at Live Nation, which is promoting Kahan's tour. “He is always intentional about the fan experience, making thoughtful decisions to ensure fans can access and enjoy his shows.”


	For the Great Divide outing, Kahan made use of two Ticketmaster programs that aim to improve the fan experience when it comes to purchasing concert tickets. One of these is identity verification, known as Persona, in which Ticketmaster uses multiple forms of identification to help block potential scammers. Kahan used Persona verification during presale signup to help protect fans, making him the first artist to do so. 


	Additionally, Kahan is using Ticketmaster's Face Value Exchange program, which caps resale prices at the original price paid with no added fees. Since becoming available in 2019, artists including Hayley Williams, Billie Eilish and Foo Fighters have used the program. 


	“Noah's priority has always been the fans,” says manager Drew Simmons, a partner at Foundations. “I'm proud to work with an artist that is willing to take risks and lead the way by implementing these new security measures, a first at stadium scale.” 


	Simmons adds that “beyond fighting bots and brokers,” the team prioritized keeping ticket prices reasonable, with floor seats starting at $150, including fees. The team also ran a lottery for the general admission pit, offering up a portion of those tickets for $100, including fees. 


	“Noah's relationship with fans is meaningful and the demand for tickets has been exceptional,” says Simmons. “We're already looking ahead to what we can do next to offer more.” 


	Not only is Kahan making his shows more affordable and accessible to fans, but he is continuing his work – on and off the road – as a mental health advocate through The Busyhead project, which he launched in 2023. Busyhead has raised over $5.5 million to date, and with The Great Divide Tour, will earn another $2 million thanks to Ticketmaster and Tickets For Good's Make a Difference initiative, which helps teachers, healthcare workers and non-profit staff receive free or significantly discounted tickets. Both Kahan himself and Live Nation contributed donations of $1 million to the Make a Difference program, which will be donated to The Busyhead Project.


	Kahan's sold-out stadium run – which includes an unprecedented four nights at Fenway Park – sold over one million tickets. The 30-date tour begins June 11 in Orlando, Fl. and wraps Aug. 31 in Seattle, Wash. 


	Kahan's last album, Stick Season, became a cultural phenomenon. The album reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and its title track earned Kahan his first Hot 100 top 10. He bested that placement with The Great Divide's lead single and title track, which debuted at No. 6.

Executive Editor Of International & Co-Head Of Film


EXCLUSIVE: Tiffany Haddish (Bad Boys: Ride Or Die) and Rosario Dawson (Ahsoka) are attached to star in The Lesson, a horror-thriller from American Heist and The Bachelor executive producer JoJo Ryder, who will also direct and has scripted.


	The film “centers on a devoted teacher whose death sets off a chain of disturbing events that begin to haunt his former students. As unsettling incidents escalate, long-buried secrets and unresolved guilt resurface, forcing the group to confront a past they believed was safely behind them.” Additional casting is in process.

	Executive producers include Shaun Kowlessar, Jeff Williams, Lindsay Butler and Ryder Media. Filming is being lined up for this year in LA.


	Grammy and Emmy winner Haddish commented: “What drew me to The Lesson was how layered it is. It's not just horror — it's about choices, consequences, and the things we think we can walk away from. Audiences are in for something unexpected.”


	Five-time Critics' Choice nominee Dawson added: “I'm excited about the project, looking forward to be working with Tiffany and JoJo.”


	“I'm thrilled to have Tiffany and Rosario join The Lesson,” Ryder said. “They bring intensity, range, and a fearless presence that elevates every scene. This story demands emotional depth as much as suspense, and they deliver both.”

	











	Haddish is in post on movies including The Toad, The Deputy and Motion. Dawson has season two of Disney's Star Wars spinoff series Ahsoka upcoming.

					By Destiny Jackson 

Awards Writer


EXCLUSIVE: Angela Sant'Albano has been revealed as the voice and motion-capture performer for the new leading character Grace Ashcroft in Capcom's upcoming video game Resident Evil: Requiem.


	The game was revealed in a surprise announcement during Los Angeles' Summer Game Fest in June, commemorating 30 years of the Resident Evil franchise. It will be released February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch 2.


Requiem, the ninth installment in the video game series, takes place about 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City and centers on FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak protagonist Alyssa Ashcroft, who is still haunted by the mysterious death of her mother some eight years earlier. When she is thrown into an investigation of murders connected to her mother's past in Raccoon City, she catches the eye of former Umbrella scientist Dr. Victor Gideon, who claims Grace holds the key to unlocking a secret project. Somewhere along the way in Grace's investigation, she crosses paths with anti-bioterrorism agent and longtime series mainstay Leon Kennedy, who holds dark secrets of his own.

	











	Capcom also has confirmed the return of Nick Apostolides, who took over the voice of Leon Kennedy in the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4 remakes and Netflix's series Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Since Resident Evil's video game debut in 1996, the series continues to be among Capcom's most popular and highest-grossing titles. As of 2025, the franchise has amassed $11 billion in sales: $8 billion from games and $3 billion from TV, film, casino spinoffs and merchandising. The recent release of Resident Evil 4 remake (2023) sold more than 10 million units. While Resident Evil Village (2021), the eighth mainline title and canonical predecessor to Resident Evil: Requiem, broke records as the fastest-selling game in the series at 13.5 million units sold in the four years since its release. Weapons director Zach Cregger is currently working on a Resident Evil film reboot. 

	











	Sant'Albano previously appeared on Season 3 of HBO's Industry, HBO Max's I Hate Suzie and Apple TV's The Buccaneers. She made her feature film debut alongside Nicole Kidman, Laura Linney and Colin Firth in 2016's Genius, directed by Michael Grandage.


	She is repped by Independent Talent Group and Aaron Bergman from Iconoclast.

					By Rosy Cordero 

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Prime Video‘s hit series Jury Duty is returning for a second season on March 20, and Deadline has your first look at the 14 new ensemble castmembers.


Jury Duty Presents: Company Retreat will feature Alex Bonifer (Kevin Can F**k Himself), Blair Beeken (Pluribus), Emily Pendergast (Veep), Erica Hernandez (True Lies), Jerry Hauck (Paradise), Jim A. Woods (The Office), LaNisa Renee Frederick (Shifting Gears), Marc-Sully Saint-Fleur (Home Economics), Rachel Kaly (Worried), Rob Lathan (Inside Amy Schumer), Ryan Perez (The Break with Michelle Wolf), Stephanie Hodge (The Comeback), Warren Burke (Dead for a Dollar), and Wendy Braun (Atypical).

	











	Season 2 will premiere March 20 with three episodes, followed by two episodes on March 27, and a three-episode finale on April 3.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Co-created and executive produced by Lee Eisenberg  (Lessons In Chemistry, The Office) and Gene Stupnitsky (Hello Ladies, The Office), Jury Duty Presents: Company Retreat is a documentary-style comedy that captures a corporate offsite event at a family-owned hot sauce company from the perspective of Anthony, a recently hired temporary worker. 


RELATED: Chelsea Handler To Play Washed-Up Reality Star In ‘Townhouse' Comedy Series In The Works At Hulu From Zoe Young


	Unbeknownst to Anthony, the entire experience is staged, every colleague around him is performing a role, and each moment – whether in conference rooms or during downtime – has been meticulously orchestrated. As the founder prepares to step down, the getaway transforms into a clash between big corporate ambitions and small business values, with control of the company hanging in the balance.

	











Jury Duty's first installment chronicled the inner workings of an American jury trial through the eyes of one particular juror, Ronald Gladden. Gladden is unaware that the entire case is fake, everyone except him is an actor, and everything that happens — inside the courtroom and out — is carefully planned.


RELATED: Netflix Orders ‘Dang!' Adult Animated Series Starring Stephanie Hsu, Poppy Liu & Andrew Law From ‘The Good Place' Trio


	As we reported last year, the theme of the new installment is David Vs. Goliath, which centers on a small business going on a company retreat. To protect the integrity of the premise, with the regular person not realizing that they are part of a scripted TV show, just like they did with Season 1, the casting and production of the new installment were done in a clandestine manner.


	Jake Szymanski directs and executive produces the series. David Bernad also executive produces with Todd Schulman, Nicholas Hatton, Anthony King, Chris Kula, James Marsden and Ruben Fleischer.

The show's great, why did they need to make a film? Barry's got a dodge-y accent happening, why not keep his natural accent if Tommy wasn't around to raise him?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","UPDATE: Alarming Online Searches About Nancy Guthrie Found Before Abduction","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-update-home-address-searched-online/","Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:08:15 GMT","

Some disturbing online searches related to Nancy Guthrie and her daughter, Savannah Guthrie, were made before her disappearance, online data shows.

According to Fox News Digital, Google Trends reports appear to show queries for Nancy's home and Savannah's salary as the “Today” show co-host.

The outlet reported that someone in Arizona searched for Nancy's Tucson address between June 21 and 28, 2025, and again on January 11, 2026.

Separate Google image searches for Nancy Guthrie's residential address were also conducted between March 1 and 8, 2025, as well as on November 30 and December 1, 2025, according to Fox News Digital.

The outlet noted that the queries were specifically looking for images or a map of Nancy's house.

In addition to searches for Nancy's address, queries about “Savannah Guthrie's salary” were made in the days before the abduction, originating in Tucson between December 13 and 20, 2025.

In comparison, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Fox News' Sean Hannity also generated similar searches.

The outlet revealed that someone from the New York area looked up “Anderson Cooper salary” between March 29 and April 5, 2025. Someone also appeared to search “Sean Hannity salary” between May 3 and 10, 2025.

Meanwhile, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos remains optimistic as the search for Nancy Guthrie continues. He said he will only begin to worry if the flow of tips starts to slow down.

“Because let's face it, you've been around enough to know that when these tips dry up, this case goes cold,” Nanos told KGUN. “We believe somebody out there knows who did this. We need that person to call.”

The Sheriff's Department has reportedly taken in nearly 18,000 tips and still counting.

On Wednesday, Nanos said he believes Nancy is still in the area.

“I think she's somewhere here in our community,” Nanos told BBC. “I just do. I don't know why. I don't have any evidence to prove that, but I just believe that she's somewhere here locally.”

As the search continues, the FBI reportedly reached out to Mexican authorities to spread the word to various police agencies.

TMZ reported that the FBI believes Nancy was taken across the border, but it's unlikely it happened directly after the kidnapping.

Detectives reportedly scoured border patrol cameras and other electronic devices, but there was still no sign of Nancy.

Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her home on February 1.

There is something (ahem) distinctly abnormal afoot in the town of Normal, Minnesota. There's the very luxe new town hall (where did these everyday folk find $16.8 million for that?). There are the kindly old townspeople who seem way to plugged into the police scanner. And the police? Why do they have such a stash of heavy-duty firepower?

These questions, and more, are on offer in the first full trailer for Ben Wheatley‘s latest, “Normal.” The biggest question of all, however: why can't you people just let Bob Odenkirk rest? As Normal's newest (interim!) sheriff, his Ulysses is about to get plunged into yet another energetic action outing that doesn't give a damn about his own professional desires.  

 








Related Stories Romance Without Limits: The Cinematography of ‘Wuthering Heights' ‘What Genre Do You Think This Is?': Kevin and Matthew McManus on the Delightfully Original ‘Redux Redux' 

Per the film‘s official logline, this “kinetic neo-Western action film stars Odenkirk as an unassuming substitute sheriff with a troubled past who, after moving to a small, sleepy town, responds to a bank robbery and unknowingly uncovers something far more explosive. For Sheriff Ulysses (Odenkirk), his provisional posting to the quaint Midwestern American town of Normal was meant to be a welcome respite from both his marital woes and recent moral injuries in the line of duty. But when a botched bank robbery interrupts the municipality's tranquil pace, a dark secret is inadvertently exposed, and Ulysses soon discovers that the town is anything but its namesake.”

The film also stars Henry Winkler and Lena Headey, and was written by “John Wick” screenwriter Derek Kolstad. Like Odenkirk's recent mini-franchise “Nobody,” the film continues to make the case for Bob Odenkirk, Action Hero. (Kolstad also wrote both “Nobody” and “Nobody 2.”)

Before the film premiered at last year's Toronto International Film Festival, Odenkirk, Kolstad, and producer Marc Provissiero told IndieWire about their plans for more films like “Normal” and “Nobody.” The trio even formed an official production company — more of a “creative partnership” — dedicated to making stylish, fun, and original action movies.

“There's a cookie cutter action type story you can tell and it will satisfy an audience, I understand that. I grasp that there's an audience out there, and I don't want to name names, but I don't need to because you can conjure them up without effort,” Odenkirk told IndieWire. “There is a kind of movie that if you make it and it looks reliably satisfying, it will get its audience. But I'm always trying to find something more, find something more to the form, smuggle in something more than just the accepted values of that genre.”

Magnolia Pictures will release the film in theaters on Friday, April 17. Check out the film's first full trailer below.

Woody is back, and this time, he's wearing a poncho. And has a bald spot. 

The new trailer for “Toy Story 5” has dropped, and it returns Woody (from retirement? exile?) to his old friends and to help out Jessie's owner Bonnie from yet another new threat taking kids away from their beloved toys: a tablet. 

The new trailer shows Woody Eastwood teaming up with Buzz and the gang to curb the influence of Lilypad, an interactive, talking green teaching tablet shaped like a frog that has Bonnie obsessed with screen time. 

Franchise newbie Greta Lee voices Lilypad, and we get a taste of her character in a scene in which Jessie confronts her and asks if she's even listening, to which Lilypad replies, “I'm always listening” and then repeats Jessie's words in both English and Spanish. Lilypad soon conspires to send the toys away and have “tech” take over playtime from the toys.

“Toy Story 5” is directed by Andrew Stanton (“WALL•E,” “Finding Nemo,” “Finding Dory”), making it the first time the Pixar veteran is taking on the “Toy Story” franchise as a director specifically, even though he co-wrote all four previous entries (he's the sole screenwriter on this entry). The film is co-directed by Kenna Harris (“Ciao Alberto”) and produced by Lindsey Collins. Randy Newman is also back to score his fifth “Toy Story” feature. 

Each of the last “Toy Story” films, including the third in 2010 and the fourth in 2019, surpassed $1 billion at the box office globally. “Toy Story 5” releases in theaters nationwide on Friday, June 19. Watch the film's new trailer below.

							By 

	Michael Embrich



	The Department of Veterans Affairs this week issued a public notice announcing some changes in how it evaluates disability ratings. The administration has been finding ways to shortchange veterans since Donald Trump retook office last year, and the VA's new rules for determining disability ratings, which are how the government determines what kind of benefits veterans receive, appears to be yet another way to erode care for the men and women who have served the nation.


	The new rules, which went into effect on an interim basis on Tuesday, open the door for the VA to slash earned disability ratings from veterans in two major ways, breaking from years of established U.S. law on workers' compensation.


	First, the VA can now take medication into account when rating a disability. For example, tinnitus, or ear ringing, is one of the most common conditions for which the VA assigns a disability rating. Under the new rule, if the VA says aspirin or painkillers reduce your tinnitus, they can lower your rating or refuse to rate it at all.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Second, the VA can factor a veteran's earning capacity into a disability rating. If the VA determines that a veteran is employed, it can deny disability or pension payments entirely. It's a cruel and arbitrary change. If you give a leg for your country, you should be compensated for it, whether you work a job that requires use of the leg or not.


	VA disability ratings are a government acknowledgement that military service led to a permanent condition that affects quality of life and long-term earning capacity. They are given on a percentage scale. One veteran could be rated 100 percent permanently disabled, for example, while another can be rated at 10 or 20 percent for minor injuries or ailments. The percentage determines monthly pay, health care priority, housing and caregiver programs, and other benefits. It is not unemployment assistance. It is indemnity for harm incurred in service.

	











	For generations, VA disability compensation has followed the same legal logic as workers' compensation. The compensation is for the injury itself, independent of how well you may be able to manage it. This was codified in U.S. law by Ingram v. Collins, a 2025 case brought against VA Secretary Doug Collins in which the court ultimately ruled that when a VA disability rating rule does not explicitly mention medication, the VA must evaluate the veteran's condition as it is, without the assistance of medication. The decision was designed to protect veterans from losing benefits regardless of whether they followed medical advice. The new rule announced this week explicitly mentions the need to “minimize the negative impact” of Ingram v. Collins.

	Before the new policy was announced this week, the VA rated conditions based on their underlying severity over time, not whether medication temporarily reduced symptoms or whether the veteran was employed. A veteran could work and still receive compensation because the payment recognized the existence of the service-connected injury. Tinnitus, PTSD, asthma, and chronic pain were evaluated on medical impairment and functional impact in daily life, while separate programs handled inability to work.


	The VA claims the new rule does not represent any significant change in policy. “This regulation simply formalizes VA's longstanding practice of determining disability ratings based on Veterans' service-related disabilities and any medications they are taking to treat those disabilities,” VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement to Rolling Stone.


	Veterans groups see it differently.


	“For years, courts held that VA could not reduce ratings based on the effects of medication, requiring evaluation of a veteran's true functional impairment when evaluating a service-connected disability,” Veterans of Foreign Wars said in a statement. “This new rule reverses that standard, directing examiners to rate disabilities as they present, including the impact of medication, and to disregard unmedicated baseline severity.”

	VFW National Commander Carol Whitmore added that while “VA has authority to amend the rating schedule, it must do so without adversely affecting veterans.”


	Coleman Lee, national commander of veterans group DAV, wrote in a statement that the group is “extremely disappointed and alarmed by VA's decision to issue an Interim Final Rule today that could potentially reduce disability compensation for millions of disabled veterans” and that the “new regulation would allow VA to reduce disability compensation ratings for veterans who take medications to control their conditions or reduce their symptoms.”

	











	The VA rewriting the rules on disability ratings, like many of the department's actions since Trump retook office, is in line with Project 2025, which called for a number of measures that would negatively impact health care and other benefits for veterans. “Efforts to expand disability benefits to large populations without adequate planning have caused an erosion of veterans' trust in the VA enterprise,” Brooks T. Tucker wrote in the notorious right-wing policy manifesto. In fact, the opposite is true.

	The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are already trying to restrict veteran care through  bills that seek to redirect funds from the VA to outside private providers. The disability rating changes, however, are a back-door way for the administration to continue to turn the screws on veterans without congressional authorization.


	The new rule changes could drastically change the way the VA decides compensation and disability claims, which accounts for over 50 percent of the VA's overall budget. As Trump calls for a historic $1.5 trillion military budget for 2027 (which Congress supports) while racking up a multi-trillion-dollar budget deficit, it seems once again that veterans will be the ones paying the price so billionaires and trillionaires can get their tax breaks.

Congressman Eric Burlison has claimed he heard reports of a crashed alien craft “so large it cannot be moved.” 

On a Newsmax TV interview with Rob Finnerty, Burlison proclaimed: “I'm not going to mention the country because I heard of it inside of a closed setting, and I want to protect my classification level.”

Burlison says he hasn't personally verified the craft, as it comes down to politicians' jurisdictions being closed off when investigating classified materials: “I'm having a difficult time getting access to facilities that are just within a few miles from my office in Washington, DC,” he added. 

The congressman refrained from explicitly mentioning which country he was referring to by alluding to confidentiality agreements. 

“To try to attempt to go to another country and get permission at that level is going to be somewhat insurmountable.”

As the case for governmental transparency gains traction, Burlison remains committed:  


If I come under any hard evidence… I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe.


Burlison's comments follow up on a recent observation about UAP videos from a Pentagon briefing, addressing the frustration of slow communication at the top regarding UFO disclosure.

Meanwhile, in the same interview, Dr. Steven Greer claims multiple alien craft have been “brought down,” some “bigger than a football field.”

Greer, a retired trauma physician turned prominent UFOlogist, named a specific location: “One [craft] in the mountains outside Seoul. It was so huge they had to build a structure around it.” Greer stipulated he was able to mention this as he is not bound by the same confidential terms as Burlison.

Greer also mentioned another craft near Fort Sill, Oklahoma, allegedly concealed by a structure, though it wasn't as elaborate as the Korean site, suggesting a highly cordoned-off area stateside.

Tellingly, he also mentioned that he had been in contact with a top-secret Pentagon-connected informant, without naming them officially, as dialogue seems tentative yet ongoing.

These claims come amid renewed interest in UFOs, following recent remarks by Barack Obama on The Brian Tyler Cohen Show: “They're real, but I haven't seen them.” 

He added, “They're not being kept at Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

Obama later clarified that he had been participating in a quick-fire round of questioning, with the interview not necessarily centered around UAP disclosure – unlike some of his more leftfield contemporaries.

This exposure, along with the Burlison and Green interview, concurs with the circulation (though heavily redacted for the public) of the Pentagon UAP reports, which include over 750 sightings from May 2023 to June 2024.

Twenty of those sightings were considered worthy of investigation, indicating that the case for whistleblowers is gaining traction as more evidence comes under the spotlight.

Presidential and public curiosity about the possible existence of aliens and UFOs has been part of the national conversation for over half a century. 

The big picture: The debate was reignited last week after former President Barack Obama said aliens are ""real,"" though he added that he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial species during his time in office. 

State of play: Interest in UFOs and aliens has surged in recent years, after former military intelligence officer and whistleblower David Gursch in 2023 claimed the Pentagon and other federal agencies were withholding information about unidentified anomalous phenomenons (UAPs).

Here are some of the presidents who have expressed fascination with the prospect of little green men. 

Zoom in: In 1977, Carter placed messages in two golden records attached to the Voyager spacecrafts, which are still traveling beyond the solar system. 

Yes, but: Once Carter became president, he said releasing such information could have adverse ""defense implications,"" which he said could threaten national security. 

Reagan believed that he encountered a UFO during a plane ride in the 1970s, an account also echoed by his pilot. 

In a 2014 interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Clinton revealed his longstanding interest in extraterrestrial life, saying he had aides research Area 51 — the top-secret U.S. Air Force base that has fueled decades of UFO speculation — to ensure there was no hidden alien activity there. 

What they're saying: ""If we were visited someday I wouldn't be surprised,"" Clinton told Kimmel. ""I just hope that it's not like 'Independence Day,"" he said of the 1996 movie.

In a 2021 interview with James Corden, Obama said he investigated UAPs and joked that his administration did not find a lab studying alien specimens.

Less than one week after Obama's comments about the possible existence of alien life, Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump told the New York Post that the president has ""some speech"" he may give about ""some sort of extraterrestrial life"" at the right time. 

Flashback: Trump during his first term in 2019 told ABC News that he received a briefing on UFOs, but was skeptical about the existence of aliens.

A new DHS memo details plan to allow federal immigration officers to detain legal refugees in the US indefinitely 

The Trump administration is moving to arrest thousands of people already legally admitted to the US as refugees and detain them indefinitely for aggressive “rescreening”, a report published on Thursday said.

Under the new policy, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that federal immigration officers can and should arrest anyone who has not yet obtained the right to permanent residence, a so-called green card, and subject them to interviews to assess their refugee claims while they are in custody, as first reported by the Washington Post.

The memo reverses a 2010 Obama administration policy that said failure to apply for a green card within a year of admission to the US was insufficient basis for such an arrest or detention, the newspaper reported.

The DHS move is pertinent to an ongoing case in Minneapolis in which a federal judge last month blocked the Trump administration from further arrests of settled refugees in Minnesota, and ordered the release of at least 100 more arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Officials said “Operation Parris” (post-admission refugee reverification and integrity strengthening), which targeted about 5,600 refugees in Minnesota who had not yet become permanent residents, was “a sweeping initiative re-examining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims”.

In his order, district court judge John Tunheim, who is scheduled to hear further arguments on Thursday in the class-action lawsuit brought by refugee groups, lambasted the detentions. “Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully,” he wrote.

Wednesday's DHS memo, also obtained by CNN, appears to directly contradict Tunheim's order, and claims existing “incomplete” guidance compels it to make arrests and detentions.

“When a refugee is admitted to the United States, the admission is conditional and subject to a mandatory review after one year,” the memo said.

Detained refugees can remain in custody “for the duration of the inspection and examination process”.

The move comes amid an escalating immigration crackdown by the Trump administration. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) plans to spend an estimated $38.3bn to buy and retrofit warehouses across the country as detention centers for tens of thousands of people, it was reported last week.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump's approval rating over his handling of immigration issues dropped to a new low in February of 38%, down from 44% in December, a Quinnipiac poll found. It followed the January killings of US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents during protests against immigration enforcement in Minneapolis.

The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization that provides legal and other support for detained Minnesota refugees and their families, called the government's move an “unprecedented reversal of decades-long interpretation of refugee law”.

Myal Greene, the group's president and chief executive, said in a statement: “The character of a nation is revealed in how it honors its commitments and how it treats the most vulnerable. Today, we have failed on both counts.

“Forcing refugees, who have already been stringently interrogated, to undergo further questioning was already an affront, but irrevocably breaking their trust by withdrawing the safety promised to them and placing them in physical custody displays a very low value of human life.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace, President Donald Trump warned anew that “bad things will happen” if Iran refuses to make a deal on its nuclear program. Trump said the world will find out “over the next, probably, ten days.”

President Donald Trump announced Thursday at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting that nine members have agreed to pledge a combined $7 billion toward a Gaza relief package, while five countries have agreed to deploy troops to take part in an international stabilization force to the war-battered Palestinian territory.

But $7 billion is only a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild Gaza, where a shaky ceasefire deal looms over Trump's ambitions for his board to rival the United Nations in solving world conflicts.

Trump also announced the U.S. was pledging $10 billion for the Board of Peace but didn't specify what the money will be used for.

Instead, the president is turning his focus to domestic issues: he's in Georgia for a trip designed to help boost Republicans' political standing heading into the midterms.

What to know:








President Donald Trump on Thursday refused to say whether he's seen evidence that aliens had visited earth.

The president was asked directly about “non-human visitors” while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One.

Trump said that former President Barack Obama shared classified information by recently suggesting that aliens are real.

“I don't know if they're real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information,” Trump said of Obama. “He's not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information.”

Trump continued: “I don't have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.”

The president said to reporters as he prepared to head to Georgia for an event that the arrest of the former prince is “very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family.”

Trump praised his brother, King Charles, and said he “would be coming to our country very soon.”

Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next week, just months after resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican.

The Democratic rebuttal will immediately follow Trump's address to Congress next Tuesday, offering the party's most high-profile opportunity to deliver a countermessage.

Spanberger, who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia's first female governor earlier this year. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.

The second lady thanked people for “the outpouring of love and excitement” that followed the January announcement by her and her husband, Vice President JD Vance, that she is pregnant with their fourth child.

“Your support means more to us than we can say,” she said Wednesday in a social media post.

But she asked supporters to refrain from sending gifts and to consider helping others instead.

“We would be honored if you would consider making a donation to your local diaper bank to help families in need,” she said.

The newest member of the Vance family, the couple's third son, is due in July. They also have a young daughter.

The Trump administration last week made a $160 million partial payment of its past dues to the United Nations regular budget, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Associated Press.

The payment comes as Trump adjourned his first meeting Thursday of the Board of Peace, a new initiative many see as his attempt to replace the U.N. Security Council's role in preventing and ending conflict around the world.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned earlier this month that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.

The U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.'s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.

It wasn't only heads of state who offered major contributions to Trump's Board of Peace.

FIFA president Giovanni Infantino outlined a new plan by the world's governing body of football — “soccer” for those who live in the U.S. — to bring new sports opportunities to war-torn Gaza.

“We don't have to rebuild houses or schools or hospitals or roads,” Infantino said. “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about.”

Specifically, FIFA pledged to spend $50 million for a national football stadium in Gaza to hold between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators in addition to a FIFA academy at a cost of $15 million. The organization also vowed to build 50 “FIFA arena mini pitches” and five full-sized pitches at a total cost of $7.5 million.

Workers are restoring an exhibit depicting the history of the nine people once enslaved in Philadelphia amid a legal fight between the city and the Trump Administration.

Mayor Cherelle Parker visited the site Thursday morning and saw the work being done, spokesperson Joe Grace said.

A federal judge had set a Friday deadline for the Interior Department to restore the exhibit on the people enslaved by George Washington at the former President's House on Independence Mall.

Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe issued the deadline Wednesday even as the Justice Department appeals her order to reinstate the exhibit.

In the last of several statements made about the United Nations, Trump ended his inaugural meeting Thursday by hinting that the U.S. -- the world body's largest donor -- will be making more changes to the institution, including to the appearance of its headquarters in New York.

Many world leaders and diplomats have been worried that Trump's new initiative was an attempt to eclipse the U.N. Security Council. But Trump attempted to assuage those concerns, saying that the U.S. will “work again with the United Nations and, bring it back to health.”

He added that his administration plans to “fix up even the building.”

“I like to see beautiful buildings. I like to see buildings fixed up physically, not look like they are in disrepair,” Trump said. “We don't like that. So we're going to do a job with the United Nations.”

Billionaire investor Marc Rowan, a member of the Board of Peace's executive committee, said reconstruction would begin in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.

He said 100,000 homes for 500,000 people, about a quarter of Gaza's population, were initially planned, along with $5 billion of infrastructure. He said “over time,” 400,000 new homes for Gaza's entire population were planned, with $30 billion in infrastructure projects.

He gave no timeline for when construction would begin.

“This is not a problem of money or collateral,” he said. “This is a problem of peace.”

In an hourslong meeting, leaders from various countries, including Peru, Bahrain and Pakistan, spent most of their speaking time praising Trump and what they called his “unprecedented” ability to end conflicts around the world.

Pakistan called him the “savior of South Asia,” while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the last year. 

The glowing remarks that went around from each corner of the globe resembled the same format and tone of Trump's Cabinet meetings, which involve less policy substance and more adulation for the Republican president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his pledge that Gaza will not be rebuilt until Hamas disarms.

“We agreed with our friends in the United States: There will be no reconstruction of the Gaza Strip before the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip,” he said in a speech to graduating officers at an army base in southern Israel.

“Soon, Hamas will face a dilemma: disarm the easy way — or disarm the hard way. But it will be disarmed, and Gaza will no longer threaten Israel.”

Iran held annual military drills with Russia on Thursday as a second American aircraft carrier drew closer to the Middle East, with both the United States and Iran signaling they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran's nuclear program fizzle out.

Trump said he hopes to reach a deal with Iran, but the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups. Indirect talks held in recent weeks made little visible progress, and one or both sides could be buying time for final war preparations.

Iran's theocracy is more vulnerable than ever, following 12 days of Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites and military last year, as well as mass protests in January that were violently suppressed. But it is still capable of striking Israel and U.S. bases, and has warned that any attack would trigger a regional war.

Despite repeatedly underscoring the importance of preventing and ending conflict, Trump made several pointed remarks during his Board of Peace meeting directed at Iran as the U.S. has amassed a significant military in the region.

The Republican president stood in front of many of the same regional allies who have pressured the U.S. in the last few weeks to not take military action against Iran and once again warned its longtime adversary to come to the table with an acceptable deal or face the consequences.

“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

The inaugural meeting of Trump's Board of Peace comes perhaps ironically at a time of high tension between the United States and Iran and one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the Middle East in decades, with one aircraft carrier group in the region already and another on the way.

The military moves have coincided with the series of threats Trump has made to Iran if it does not accede to his demands to denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding extremist proxy groups.

Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly-created International Stabilization Force, announced that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have all pledged troops to the effort. In addition, Egypt and Jordan, which border the Gaza strip, have agreed to train the police and security forces.

“With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace,” Jeffers said.

— This item has been corrected to show that Jeffers is a major general, not a general, and is not retired.

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved Trump's proposal, despite raising concerns at the panel's January meeting. Some commissioners had questioned the lead architect about its “immense” design and scale, roughly twice the size of the White House itself.

Trump's demolition of the East Wing prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction. And the project is scheduled for additional discussion at a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission, now led by one of Trump's top aides.

The vice president nodded to domestic politics heading into the midterm elections in his brief statement to the board. 

“The reason that we're here today is yes to save lives and yes to promote peace, but this creates incredible prosperity for the American people,” Vance said.

He said the countries represented on the board represent “trillions of dollars of investment” in the U.S., and support millions of American jobs by buying goods made in America.

The direct line between the Board of Peace and the U.S. economy is not completely clear. Trump's trade war has strained economic relations with several major U.S. allies.

The Republican president repeated his concerns and criticism of the United Nations during his Board of Peace meeting, saying the UN should have been more involved in conflict-solving than it has been.

But, Trump also said that the U.S. is going “to be working with the United Nations very close.”

“Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be, I think, is going to be much stronger,” he said. “The Board of Peace is gonna almost be looking over the United Nations, and making sure it runs properly.”

Trump also announced the U.S. is pledging $10 billion for the Board of Peace, but didn't specify what the money will be used for.

“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” Trump said.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait are the countries that are making pledges, Trump said.

“But every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” said Trump in thanking the donors.

The amount, while significant, represents a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of war.

Shouting out all of the various conflicts he says he solved, Trump mentioned that Iran is “a hotspot right now.” He said his envoys have had “very interesting” meetings with Iranian officials. 

His positive comments come as the two adversaries have leaned into gunboat diplomacy in recent weeks, with nuclear talks between the nations hanging in the balance, Tehran holding drills with Russia and the Americans bringing another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast.

“It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise bad things happen,” Trump said.

Trump is fueling the rivalry between the two members of his administration considered the frontrunners to replace him as the GOP's next presidential nominee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.

Trump described Vance as “a fantastic man” and a “fantastic talent” before running through the highlights of the vice president's education and marriage and noting that Vance “gets a little bit tough on occasion.”

The president then pivoted to Rubio, calling his leadership style “the opposite extreme. ... Marco does it with a velvet glove, but it's a kill.”

Trump then praised Rubio's performance at the Munich Security Conference this week, joking that if he did his job any better he'd be fired for outshining him.

Much can change in the two years before voters pick the GOP's 2028 presidential nominee. The Constitution bars Trump from seeking a third term.

A week after Trump blasted him as a RINO, short for Republican In Name Only, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt struck a conciliatory tone toward the White House.

“Politics is tough,” Stitt said Thursday at an event sponsored by Politico at the outset of the National Governors Association's annual meeting. “Politics has a way of just beating you down over time so I can't imagine being president of the United States. He's got a tough job to do.”

Stitt is the president of the NGA this year. The group, made up of governors from both parties, is typically one of the few bipartisan organizations to convene in Washington each year.

But this year's meeting has been defined by tensions as Trump has refused to invite two Democratic governors to a business meeting at the White House. Trump said Stitt mischaracterized his position.

Trump says Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the driving force behind renaming the U.S. Institute of Peace the “Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace,” in a move still being contested in courts.

“Marco named it after me,” Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace at the former USIP building. Trump said it was a surprise. Rubio is not known to have played a significant role in the renaming, although the State Department is the current custodian.

The USIP was created as an independent entity by Congress in 1984, a status Trump sought to revoke last year when the building was seized from its leadership and nearly all of its employees fired. The changes remain subject to litigation.

In one of many tangents, Trump used his speech at the Board of Peace meeting to reinforce his support for various foreign leaders who are facing or were recently facing a contested election in their country. Many of the endorsements are part of Trump's pattern of embracing autocratic leaders who are part of a global pushback against democratic traditions.

“I'm not supposed to be endorsing people, but I endorse, when I like people. You know, I've had a very good record of endorsing candidates within the United States, but now I endorse foreign leaders, including Viktor Orbán, who's here,” Trump said, mentioning also Milei and the prime minister of Japan.

While Trump convenes his Board of Peace, the nation's governors also are gathering in Washington. Their annual gathering has traditionally been a show of bipartisanship. Trump disrupted norms by not inviting all governors to meetings at the White House. 

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, joined Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, both Republicans, in opening this year's National Governors Association on a panel where they emphasized bipartisanship, regardless of Trump's actions. 

The break with tradition reflects Trump's broader approach in his second term. He has taken a confrontational stance toward some state leaders, withholding federal funds from states that draw his ire and deploying federal troops to cities over the objections of local officials.

Despite the presence Thursday of dozens of world leaders, Trump noted that many countries — including the U.K., France and Canada — have chosen to not yet accept the invitation to the Board of Peace.

“Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be. And some are playing a little cute — it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me,” Trump said. “But, this is the most prestigious board ever put together.”

In his opening remarks, Trump welcomes the dozens of world leaders in attendance and says many of them have become “incredible friends of mine.”

“Board of Peace is one of the most important and consequential things, I think, that I'll be involved in,” the second-term president said.

Trump and other world leaders have arrived at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.

Flanked by Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump stood in front of leaders from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Qatar, among others, to take a group photo before discussing the various parts of the president's peace plan for Gaza.

A number of world leaders, including Argentina's Javier Milei, Hungary's Viktor Orbán and others carried red hats with the emblem “USA” and an American flag on the side, and put them on the tables next to their country signs.

The new research tied to one of America's leading banks provides more evidence that Trump‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.

The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses Trump had promised to revive — have had to absorb the new expense by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.

“That's a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis on Thursday.

The research adds to a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration's claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that “at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations.” 

The Trump administration on Wednesday pushed back: “This president has a very bold and ambitious plan and vision to rebuild and reconstruct Gaza, which is well underway because of the Board of Peace,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “This is a legitimate organization where there are tens of member countries from around the world.”

And Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the board is “not talking, it is doing.”

“We are hearing the chattering class criticizing the structure of the board, that it's unconventional, that it's unprecedented,” Waltz said. “Again, the old ways were not working.”

Trump said this week he hopes the board would push the U.N. to “get on the ball.”

“The United Nations has great potential,” he said. “They haven't lived up to the potential.”

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is one of two federal panels reviewing the president's plans to build a ballroom twice the size of the White House itself on the site of the former East Wing.

The commission, now led by Trump's appointees, is scheduled to further discuss the project at its monthly meeting on Thursday, held over Zoom.

At last month's meeting, some of those commissioners questioned the architect about the “immense” design and scale of the project even as they broadly endorsed the president's vision for the massive expansion.

The U.S. trade deficit slipped modestly in 2025 as Trump upended global commerce by slapping double digit tariffs on imports from most countries.

The gap the between the goods and services the U.S. sells other countries and what it buys from them narrowed to just over $901 billion from $904 billion in 2024, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 

Exports rose 6% last year, and imports rose nearly 5%. The trade gap surged from January-March as U.S. companies tried to import foreign goods ahead of Trump's taxes, then narrowed most of the rest of the year.

Trump's tariffs are a tax paid by U.S. importers and often passed along to their customers as higher prices. But they haven't had as much impact on inflation as economists originally expected. Trump argues that the tariffs will protect U.S. industries, bringing manufacturing back to America and raising money for the U.S. Treasury.

Members of the United Nations Security Council are calling for Gaza ceasefire deal to become permanent, and blasting Israeli efforts to expand control in the West Bank as a threat to prospects of a two-state solution. They met Wednesday on the eve of Trump's first Board of Peace gathering to discuss the future of the Palestinian territories.

The high-level U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same day, complicating travel plans for diplomats. It is a sign of the potential for overlapping and conflicting agendas between the United Nations' most powerful body and Trump's broader ambitions to broker global conflicts, which have raised concerns in some countries that it may attempt to rival the U.N. Security Council.

Hollywood is in trouble.

The streaming boom that fueled a ton of production in the last decade-plus is gone, and lots of the remaining work is going overseas. No one really knows how AI will affect the movie and TV business, but there's lots of fear it won't be good. And barring something truly surprising, Warner Bros., one of Hollywood's most important movie and TV studios, is going to get swallowed up in the next year or so, which will mean even more consolidation.

But don't take it from me: Ask Janice Min, who has spent a couple decades enmeshed in Hollywood. First as the editor of the Hollywood Reporter, and now as CEO of The Ankler, an industry trade built for the Substack Age.

That means she's not a disinterested observer at all: If the center of the movie and TV industry is shrinking, that's bad news for the advertising, subscriptions, and events businesses she's trying to build.

I talked to Min about all of that on my Channels podcast, and you can listen to the whole thing here. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.

Peter Kafka: If you had to bet right now, who wins the newly reopened bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery?

Janice Min: Doesn't it really depend if Netflix decides they're going to step it up? So far, it seems like they will. But Netflix is a pretty ruthless company: Season two isn't working out, it's not driving as many subscribers as season one, your show is canceled. Or cofounder Reed Hastings' famous ""keeper test"": You aren't performing well. You're out.

And shareholders are not loving this pursuit of Warner Bros. At some point, they will cut it off. They're a very pragmatic company.

The conventional wisdom is that Netflix would really like this deal, and that Paramount has to have this deal. Do you agree?

I do. If you're David Ellison and you've assembled probably the most expensive leadership team in history, you are prepping to have Warner Bros. David Ellison was not prepping to have the seventh-biggest studio or the seventh-biggest streamer.

In the end, if he doesn't have that, you're kind of left holding the bag that nobody wanted. How do you win?

You are holding the thing that Shari Redstone was desperately trying to get rid of.

That's important context. This battle is so interesting to me because Warner Bros. is such a stinker, with so much debt, that they are being forced to sell. They had no other outcome. Paramount was such a stinker that Shari Redstone couldn't get the stink off of her fast enough. And there was basically, in the end, one bidder [for Paramount].

That one bidder is now one of two bidders for the other thing. We get caught up in the excitement that these are huge prizes, but they're just these debt-stuffed, slow-moving beasts that need to have someone who has an emotional attachment to them for them to make sense as a buyer.

After Netflix won the first bidding round in December, there was an immediate negative reaction from Hollywood. What's the current vibe when it comes to Netflix vs. Paramount as WBD's future owner?

I think for most people it's Sophie's Choice. There are two potential bad outcomes here.

On the plus side for David Ellison: People love that he loves movies.

""I love movies. You guys make movies. I'm gonna make more movies. You should work with me.""

It's not a sophisticated business argument, but everyone here has dollar signs spinning in their eyes, everyone's looking for the next deal for themselves. So they like that. Perhaps David Ellison will pay and maybe even overpay for what you are making. And it's exciting that it'll create a big buyer in the market.

The flip side of that is, Hollywood is not a particularly pro-Trump industry. I don't think they like a lot of the things they are seeing happening at Paramount right now, like the situation that happened with Stephen Colbert and James Talarico. They certainly don't like what's happening with CBS News.

Fundamentally, though, it does come down to your bottom line. The industry is struggling. People are having a hard time having the careers they had 10 years ago. So people like the idea of a buyer with deep pockets, even if it's daddy's money.

There is a steady stream of stories and social media posts about how AI is going to disrupt Hollywood. How much of that concern do you see reflected in day-to-day conversations?

The thing with AI right now in Hollywood: Everyone's lying just a little bit. Studios are lying about how much they're using it.

They're using it more or less?

Using it more.

Companies are lying about the capability of their products. And for creative people, they're lying about the fact that they're not using it. I dare you to find a screenwriter who is staring at a blank page and not talking to Claude or ChatGPT at the same time.

It seems clear that it's going to be a big deal for people working in visual effects, and that was already a challenged industry.

I have a friend who's been sending me LinkedIn posts that are showing up in his feed, and it is so grim. It's people largely who have worked in VFX, and they are posting this full-on bleed out, like ""I will be homeless by next Thursday if I don't have work.""

It doesn't appear they're being hyperbolic.

I guarantee that every single studio, every single streamer, they are all completely doing this. During last year's Oscar race, [there was a controversy about] ""The Brutalist,"" and how Adrian Brody's voice was made more Hungarian-accented through technology.

This year, it is crickets. Even the Academy, the most precious, legacy-protecting institution in Hollywood, has not come out in a really firm way about AI. They basically have a don't ask, don't tell policy. I would say with some certainty that every single best picture nominee this year has used AI in its production process.

What's the story people outside Hollywood are missing about your industry right now?

You look at LA and you think it's sunny and amazing and people are happy. People are having a hard time here. The unemployment rate of Los Angeles is much higher than the national average.

You're seeing a city that is so big and sprawling, with a kind of rudderless feeling: Who's going to stop this? There is definitely a Detroit vibe underway if things don't course correct.

And you're seeing a paralysis: Hollywood used to be a place that had a lot of protests, spoke out, was always fighting the so-called man. And it is pretty much crickets now, because everyone is scared.

I was struck by the fact when you saw the Grammys, you have these musicians getting up on stage, — Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny — and really sticking it to the president and ICE. And you compare that with the Golden Globes, where it was sponsored by Polymarket, and no one's saying anything.

When you think about how to capture young people, who are the pipeline for everything — they love this culture of rebellion and revolt and speaking out. I worry about Hollywood containing itself so much to the point that it stops speaking to the audience.

Waymo's big chance to bring its robotaxis to the state of New York has been thwarted — for now. 

New York Governor Kathy Hochul withdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws to effectively legalize robotaxis in the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled. 

“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was the first to report the proposal had been removed.

The withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.

“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. 

“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor's decision, we're committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”

“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo's statement.

Hochul had introduced, as part of her broader budget proposal, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.

Even if Hochul's proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state's transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.

With that proposal dead, the state's existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.

Waymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31. 

New York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.

Waymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting one million weekly rides by the end of the year.

The U.S. State Department is reportedly working on an online portal that would allow people in Europe and other regions to access content banned by their governments. The move comes at a time when conservative figures like Elon Musk and J.D. Vance have railed against European attempts to clamp down on hate speech, terrorist propaganda, and revenge porn.

Reuters reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources, that the initiative is intended to fight censorship and could include a virtual private network (VPN) feature.

The portal would reportedly be hosted at Freedom.gov. The site currently displays a landing page featuring a small animation of Paul Revere on horseback above the words “Freedom is Coming.” Smaller text below reads, “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get Ready.”

The news arrives as the Trump administration has accused European governments of censoring conservative voices online.

“Free speech, I fear, is in retreat and in the interests of comedy, my friends, but also in the interest of truth, I will admit that sometimes the loudest voices for censorship have come not from within Europe, but from within my own country, where the prior administration threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation,” Vice President J.D. Vance said in his speech last week at the Munich Security Conference.

Reuters reported that the portal was expected to launch at the conference, but was delayed.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. However, the agency told Reuters it does not have a Europe-specific censorship bypass program and denied that any announcement had been postponed.

“Digital freedom is a priority for the State Department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs,” a State Department spokesperson told Reuters.

The portal also comes as Elon Musk's social media platform X is facing mounting scrutiny in Europe. Musk has been an on-and-off ally to President Donald Trump.

Paris prosecutors' cybercrime unit, working alongside Europol and French national police, raided X's offices in the country earlier this month.

The investigation began in January 2025 over suspected manipulation of X's recommendation algorithm and illegal data extraction. It has since expanded to include complicity in the spread of pornographic images involving minors, the use of sexual deepfakes that infringe on people's rights, and the circulation of Holocaust denial content.

The European Commission has also slapped X with a $140 million fine for violating transparency obligations under the Digital Services Act, taking issue with the platform's “deceptive design” of its blue checkmark verification badges and a lack of transparency around advertising practices.

Vance responded on X by framing the penalty as an attack on an American company.

“Rumors swirling that the EU commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship. The EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage,” Vance wrote on X before the fine was announced.

Reuters also reports that the portal project involves Edward Coristine, a former member of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Coristine now works with the National Design Studio, created under Trump to redesign federal services online and in physical spaces. The studio has contributed to several Trump-era initiatives, including Trump Accounts and TrumpRx.

Ironically, The Guardian reported today that DOGE cuts to the State Department and U.S. Agency for Global Media's Internet Freedom program have effectively gutted the program.

The initiative funded grassroots tools to help people bypass government internet controls worldwide. It distributed over $500 million over the past decade but issued no funding in 2025, according to The Guardian.

U.S. men's national team captain Tim Ream said that he was sympathetic over fans' concerns about World Cup ticket prices, but emphasized that he and his teammates must focus on what they can control.

Ticket prices have been a major talking point around this summer's tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fans have complained that FIFA's pricing is “extortionate” and claimed that following a team from the tournament's start to finish will cost nearly five times as much as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

USMNT forward Tim Weah weighed in on the issue in an interview with French outlet Le Dauphiné last month.

""It is too expensive,"" Weah said. ""Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show.""

Those comments drew a rebuke from Weah's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino, who urged his players to stay away from non-soccer topics.

""First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of the [pitch],"" Pochettino said. ""It is not [Weah's] duty to evaluate the price of the ticket.""

In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Ream struck a balance.

""We know that there are other things going on, that this sport and what we do is not the be-all and end-all,"" Ream said. ""For us it is our job, and it is the biggest tournament in the history of sport, and it is our job to focus on what we're trying to do.

""Do we sympathize with the paying fans? Absolutely. However, we can't control any of that. And for us as athletes, we always talk about what we can control. What are our controllables? And that's not one of them. Things that are off the field are not one of them, unfortunately for us.

""And so what can we do? We can focus on what we do on the field, putting in good performances and inspiring people all around the country to get on board and go through this journey and go through this World Cup with us.""

Ream said that he was hopeful that a deep USMNT run in the tournament would help fuel the growth of soccer in the United States.

""It will be down to the players in the team to inspire the entire country, which is a lot of pressure,"" the Charlotte FC defender said.

""It's difficult but it's also a great challenge and if you can look at it as a challenge and you can change hearts and minds with a great performance at a World Cup, then why would we not attempt to do that?""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

New Jersey's planned World Cup fan fest in Jersey City has been cancelled as the state will instead focus on supporting more local, community-based events for fans during this summer's tournament. The decision comes just months before the World Cup kicks off and after tickets had already been sold to the planned Fan Fest.

In a surprising decision, New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill confirmed on Thursday that the fan fest would not go on as planned. Instead, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) and the FIFA World Cup 26 New York New Jersey Host Committee will partner to front an initiative that will allocate $5 million into community initiatives for soccer fans.

According to the state, the initiative will now focus on ""high-impact"" fan events that are more beneficial to small businesses across New Jersey, not just on the one Jersey City location. The original plan, which was announced in 2025, was for Liberty State Park to be open for all 104 matches of the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

""New Jersey is the beating heart of the 2026 World Cup, and this initiative makes sure that every New Jerseyan - no matter where they live - can be part of this once-in-a-generation moment,” Sherrill said in a statement to NBC. “From fan zones to neighborhood watch parties to street fairs, we are investing in the communities and small businesses that make New Jersey extraordinary. The World Cup is coming to our state - and we are going to make sure it belongs to New Jerseyans first.”

New Jersey, home of MetLife Stadium, is set to be one of the main hubs of this summer's World Cup, with the state set to host the tournament final. In addition to the finale, MetLife Stadium will host an additional seven matches, including one in the Round of 32 and one in the Round of 16.

In the group stage, the state will host matches between Brazil and Morocco on June 13, France and Senegal on June 16, Norway and Senegal on June 22, Ecuador and Germany on June 25 and Panama and England on June 27.

It's reported FIFA is unsure as to why there is a lack of hype for the 2026 World Cup - but the internet thinks it's figured it out and it's really not that surprising.

Touchline reports ""many seats remain unsold"" for a number of games across the tournament and says FIFA bosses are scratching their heads as to why.

It's the first FIFA World Cup with 48 teams and will take place across the US, Canada and Mexico.

But in the comments on Touchline's X / Twitter post, the internet seems to have worked out why there isn't the biggest amount of hype for it so far.

The top comment posted a comparison of ticket prices from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the 2026 open and the difference is astronomical. 

A second agreed: ""Have they seen the ticket prices? They expect people to buy that? If they really care about this sport they will have to adjust on that part. They price are ridiculous.""

A third commented: ""FYI - I looked up ticket prices and for the individual dollar amount, the cost is WAY out of reach of anyone unless you're seriously wealthy. We're talking $1,500 or 3K or 4K per PERSON. How is that a family event? That's just the ticket price without flight and hotel.""

A fourth posted a similar price comparison.

A fifth added: ""With that amount per ticket?? I back out, there's nothing wrong with my TV, I will watch from home 🏠""

""The pricing has put the real football fans off,"" said a sixth. ""Imagine being so out of touch with economic realities of the world. Only tourist tickets and not the real football fans down the street.""

Away from ticket prices, one said: ""That's what you get when you take the World Cup to a country that calls it soccer.""

And another agreed.

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 2 Highlights

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

Both the F1 Commission and the F1 Power Unit Advisory Committee met for discussions amid pre-season testing in Bahrain.

Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, have issued a pair of updates following meetings of the F1 Commission and the F1 Power Unit Advisory Committee on Wednesday.

In the F1 Commission gathering chaired by FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis and F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali, refinements to the 2026 F1 regulations were agreed and will now be referred to the World Motor Sport Council for approval.

“In common with the introduction of such significant regulatory changes, there are still collective learnings to be taken from pre-season testing,” read the statement on the F1 Commission meeting.

“As a group – the teams, the power unit manufacturers, FIA and Formula One Management (FOM) – there was a commitment to work through all technical aspects ahead of the opening race of the 2026 season in Melbourne next month.

“Constructive discussion took place among all the teams following initial feedback from drivers arising from a survey instigated by the FIA. Topics covered include overall car characteristics, energy and power unit, aerodynamics, overtaking and racing, tyres and mechanical grip.

“Positive feedback from drivers was received on the reduced weight and smaller dimensions of the 2026 cars. Drivers generally agreed that the new car exhibited improved ride quality and stronger initial acceleration.

“Further evaluation and technical checks on energy management matters will be carried out over the following three days at the second pre-season test in Bahrain.

“It was agreed that no immediate major regulatory changes were required given that initial evidence and feedback remains immature and that premature change carried the risk of increased instability ahead of the first race. Further reviews will be carried out once more data becomes available.

“There were constructive talks and proposals centred on the race start procedure during the commission meeting. As a result, further evaluation of updates to race systems and on-car management will be undertaken during the current Bahrain test.”

There were also discussions around the possibility of increasing the number of Sprint events up to 12 given the demand from fans and promoters.

Alongside the F1 Commission update, there was a development from the F1 Power Unit Advisory Committee regarding the assessment of the power unit compression ratio in running conditions.

“Over recent weeks and months, the FIA and the power unit manufacturers have collaboratively developed a methodology to quantify how the compression ratio changes from ambient to operating conditions,” read the statement.

“Following validation of this approach, a proposal has been submitted whereby, from August 1, 2026, compliance with the compression ratio limit must be demonstrated not only at ambient conditions, but also at a representative operating temperature of 130°C.

“The vote has been submitted to the power unit manufacturers, and its outcome is expected within the next 10 days and will be communicated in due course.”

As with all F1 regulatory changes, and as touched on above, any amendments remain subject to final approval by the FIA World Motor Sport Council.

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 2 Highlights

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

As the start of the 2026 season fast approaches, Aston Martin have made changes to their trackside engineering structure.

Aston Martin have made changes to their trackside engineering team ahead of the 2026 season, with the squad expanding the structure in order to cope with the additional demands posed by the new technical regulations.

Gary Gannon is set to step up to the role of Senior Race Engineer on Lance Stroll's side of the garage, with Stephen Glass moving to the position of Race Engineer.

Andrew Vizard, meanwhile, will stay on as Race Engineer to Fernando Alonso, while Chris Cronin becomes Senior Race Engineer, a role he will hold alongside acting as Trackside Chief Engineer.

The restructuring comes as Aston Martin continue their preparations for the 2026 campaign, with the British outfit having been open about their early struggles during the Barcelona Shakedown and pre-season testing in Bahrain.

Away from the track, a crucial aspect of how a driver prepares for the season is in terms of their fitness. For Stroll, performance coach Henry Howe supports the Canadian driver when it comes to ensuring that he is functioning at his top level.

Speaking to Aston Martin's official website, Howe offered an insight into how his role fits alongside the likes of the engineers and mechanics in working with Stroll to prepare him for the upcoming campaign.

“On the medical side, I manage musculoskeletal care and recovery,"" Howe explains. ""On the fitness side, I'm keeping Lance healthy and in race trim. Because he's played sport his whole life, that's pretty easy, and it's more about me directing him towards the best stuff to do, rather than motivating him to do it.

“As a taller driver (1.84 metres), Lance has always had to be on top of his physical wellbeing to avoid giving away lap-time through weight. So it's about constantly being on top of his diet and training rather than having to manage big swings in his weight.

“If you arrive at a race weekend not fit or healthy, it's too late. Once we're at the track, my job is to create an environment where Lance can focus purely on driving.”

In terms of Stroll's pre-season regime, Howe adds: “We're constantly exploring and searching for ways we can do things better and improve. In a sport where the only constant is change, we have to keep evolving.

""We control what we can control. We refine. We research. And then we do it all again.""

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 2 Highlights

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

McLaren topped the times from Red Bull and Mercedes during Thursday morning's session in the Sakhir desert.

Lando Norris posted the fastest time as pre-season testing continued at the Bahrain International Circuit on Thursday, leading the way from Max Verstappen and George Russell.

McLaren driver Norris clocked a 1m 33.453s during the first four-hour session of the day, putting him just over a tenth ahead of Red Bull rival Verstappen, and some six-tenths up on Mercedes man Russell.

Norris and Russell both worked their way past race distances in productive outings, before they move aside for team mates Oscar Piastri and Kimi Antonelli this afternoon – five teams opting to swap drivers over lunch, and six sticking with a single driver all day.

Alex Albon, Ollie Bearman and Franco Colapinto also got a solid amount of mileage on the board for Williams, Haas and Alpine, placing fourth, sixth and seventh respectively, and sandwiching the Audi of Gabriel Bortoleto.

Bortoleto and Liam Lawson both spent lengthy spells in the pits as Audi and Racing Bulls worked on their cars, limiting them to around half a race distance, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso also below the 57-lap milestone.

Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari completed the fewest laps of the session, though – unspecified issues interrupting the seven-time World Champion's programme and limiting him to a handful of tours after he emerged with an intriguing test item.

Indeed, Ferrari got technical figures talking up and down the pit lane when the upper element of their rear wing appeared to flip upside down in ‘Straight Mode', seemingly to further explore Active Aero options and the transition between straights and corners.

Valtteri Bottas brought up the rear for 2026 newcomers Cadillac with a time some 6.7s slower than Norris' benchmark, after the team spent the first hour or so of the session in their garage for the second successive test day.

Despite that lengthy delay, the Finn managed to get a full race distance on the board – and gather another round of useful data for the squad to dig into – ahead of team mate Sergio Perez's stint at the wheel in the afternoon.

F1 drivers and teams will now take a break for lunch, with the penultimate afternoon session in Bahrain due to get under way at 1500 local time – running until 1900 as the sun sets and the floodlights switch on.

F1 Bahrain Testing Week 2 2026: Day 2 Highlights

Ocon: 'A very good day for us'

After George Russell went fastest on the first day of the second pre-season test in Bahrain, it was the turn of Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli to top the timesheets on Day 2.

Kimi Antonelli set the pace on Day 2 of the second 2026 pre-season test in Bahrain, with the Mercedes racer heading the timesheets from McLaren's Oscar Piastri and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.

Lando Norris had led the way during Thursday's morning session on a 1m 33.453s – but as the times came down further across the afternoon, it was Antonelli who ended the day on top with his effort of 1m 32.803s.

Lewis Hamilton was the first to hit the track when the day's second segment got underway at 1500 local time, the Ferrari man seemingly keen to get more mileage after completing only five laps earlier.

Others soon started to join the fray, with some drivers taking over from their team mates for the afternoon session including Piastri, Antonelli and Haas' Ollie Bearman.

Shortly after Verstappen beat Norris' earlier time to put himself at the top of the timesheets less than one hour into the afternoon, fellow World Champion Fernando Alonso brought out the red flags after stopping his Aston Martin out on track.

After the AMR26 was safely cleared away, the action resumed with just under three hours left on the clock for the teams and drivers to continue with their programmes. Several set about adding further laps to their tally, with Hamilton making up for lost time by gaining further mileage while Antonelli was racking up a solid number of tours.

Some also appeared to be pushing as the sun began to set and more representative conditions started to kick in at the Bahrain International Circuit, as the likes of Hamilton and Alpine's Franco Colapinto experienced lock-ups.

Others took the opportunity to complete some soft tyre runs, with Williams' Alex Albon and Sergio Perez in the Cadillac both switching to the red-walled rubber during the latter stages of Thursday afternoon.

The name at the top of the board continued to change as the session progressed; Piastri had bettered Verstappen's effort to go fastest, before Antonelli displaced the McLaren in the P1 slot with a time set during the final hour.

As was the case on Day 1, Thursday's session ended with a practice new race starts light procedure – though there were seemingly issues for Piastri in the closing minutes of Day 2, the Australian pulling over to the side of the track before then getting going again.

In terms of the timesheets, Antonelli's lap of 1m 32.803s remained unbeaten, with Piastri 0.058s adrift in second while Verstappen – who clocked the day's highest lap count of 139 –  was just over three-tenths back from Antonelli's time in third.

Hamilton slotted into fourth, while Norris' morning session lap kept him in fifth place ahead of Colapinto, Audi's Nico Hulkenberg, Mercedes' George Russell, the Haas of Esteban Ocon and Liam Lawson in the Racing Bulls.

Albon was 11th for Williams, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto in the Audi, Bearman, Perez and Alonso, the latter completing just 68 laps after failing to rejoin the session following his earlier stoppage. Valtteri Bottas was the final classified name for Cadillac, with six drivers having not participated in Thursday's running while their team mates took over driving duties.

There is now just one day of 2026 pre-season testing in Bahrain remaining, with the teams and drivers set to return on Friday for a final chance to run their cars ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 6-8.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	In his first outing behind the camera since Barry, his Emmy-winning dark comedy for HBO, Bill Hader has officially locked in plans to write, direct and star in They Know, a new horror film for MRC, which will begin production in Los Angeles this spring.


They Know centers on a divorced dad (Hader) who grows suspicious that his ex-wife is secretly dating a mysterious man who is having a strange influence on their children.


	With the film, Hader is set to become the latest major comedic talent to make his mark in horror, joining a lineage that includes the likes of Jordan Peele, Zach Cregger, and most recently, Curry Barker.

	











	MRC is the studio financing the project, which is based on an original story Hader created with his Barry collaborator Duffy Boudreau. Bob Graf and Hader are set to produce under the latter's Hanarply banner, with Alyssa Donovan co-producing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	With his work on Barry, a tragicomedy about a hitman trying to turn over a new leaf as an actor, only for the consequences of his actions to slowly but surely catch up with him, Hader became the rare winner of three DGA Awards, also winning multiple Emmys and Critics Choice Awards. Hader co-created the show with Alec Berg and also served as its co-showrunner, executive producer, director, writer, and star. A longtime cast member on Saturday Night Live, Hader's other acting credits include Trainwreck, Superbad and The Skeleton Twins. He will next be starring in Warner Bros. Pictures Animations' The Cat in the Hat, out November 6.


	Coming off the release of Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights, which has grossed over $92M worldwide in a little over a week, MRC's upcoming slate includes The Only Living Pickpocket in New York and The Gallerist, which just premiered at Sundance, as well as A Place in Hell, The Best Is Yet to Come, Unabomer, and Eloise.


	Hader is repped by UTA and Felker Toczek Suddleson. Nominated for three Emmys, with additional credits including The Lowdown, Hit-Monkey, Documentary Now!, and Big Mouth, Boudreau is repped by UTA and TroyGould.
