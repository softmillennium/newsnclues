                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team captain Tim Ream said that he was sympathetic over fans' concerns about World Cup ticket prices, but emphasized that he and his teammates must focus on what they can control. Ticket prices have been a major talking point around this summer's tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fans have complained that FIFA's pricing is “extortionate” and claimed that following a team from the tournament's start to finish will cost nearly five times as much as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. USMNT forward Tim Weah weighed in on the issue in an interview with French outlet Le Dauphiné last month. "Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. Those comments drew a rebuke from Weah's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino, who urged his players to stay away from non-soccer topics. "First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of the [pitch]," Pochettino said. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Ream struck a balance. "We know that there are other things going on, that this sport and what we do is not the be-all and end-all," Ream said. "For us it is our job, and it is the biggest tournament in the history of sport, and it is our job to focus on what we're trying to do. "Do we sympathize with the paying fans? However, we can't control any of that. "And so what can we do? We can focus on what we do on the field, putting in good performances and inspiring people all around the country to get on board and go through this journey and go through this World Cup with us." Ream said that he was hopeful that a deep USMNT run in the tournament would help fuel the growth of soccer in the United States. "It's difficult but it's also a great challenge and if you can look at it as a challenge and you can change hearts and minds with a great performance at a World Cup, then why would we not attempt to do that?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Jersey's planned World Cup fan fest in Jersey City has been cancelled as the state will instead focus on supporting more local, community-based events for fans during this summer's tournament. In a surprising decision, New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill confirmed on Thursday that the fan fest would not go on as planned. Instead, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) and the FIFA World Cup 26 New York New Jersey Host Committee will partner to front an initiative that will allocate $5 million into community initiatives for soccer fans. According to the state, the initiative will now focus on "high-impact" fan events that are more beneficial to small businesses across New Jersey, not just on the one Jersey City location. The original plan, which was announced in 2025, was for Liberty State Park to be open for all 104 matches of the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. "New Jersey is the beating heart of the 2026 World Cup, and this initiative makes sure that every New Jerseyan - no matter where they live - can be part of this once-in-a-generation moment,” Sherrill said in a statement to NBC. “From fan zones to neighborhood watch parties to street fairs, we are investing in the communities and small businesses that make New Jersey extraordinary. New Jersey, home of MetLife Stadium, is set to be one of the main hubs of this summer's World Cup, with the state set to host the tournament final.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has suggested that every match for the 2026 men's World Cup will be sold out and claimed FIFA have received requests for over one million tickets per game for 77 of the 104 matches during the tournament in North America. On Wednesday, Infantino appeared as a guest at the World Liberty Forum hosted at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. World Liberty Financial, who convened the invite-only business conference, is co-founded by President Trump and his three sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron are also among the co-founders. The conference included appearances from business leaders, senators and investors, with Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali speaking alongside AC Milan's owner Gerry Cardinale, while artist Nicki Minaj also appeared. In a subsequent interview with CNBC, Infantino provided details on the progress of FIFA's controversial ticketing policy for the World Cup, with record-high prices branded by supporters groups as a “monumental betrayal”, while also bringing criticism from politicians including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani. FIFA has sought to resist suggestions that many of these requests may be bots, claiming that every request was “validated by unique credit card data.” For the first time, Infantino also provided insight into more granular data, although he did not clarify the full spread of requests across games. Asked if he is concerned that high ticket prices risk alienating supporters, Infantino replied: “It's not a problem in the sense that the demand is there. When asked by The Athletic to clarify how, exactly, games can be sold out if tickets are being held for later sales, a FIFA source indicated that Infantino had misspoke and that he was instead meaning to say that FIFA expect all the games to sell out. They were also unable to immediately clarify Infantino's calculations when he claimed an audience of six billion for the World Cup — the global population is eight billion. Infantino said he expected FIFA revenues from the tournament to exceed $11 billion, while claiming that the U.S. economy will receive $30 billion in economic impact, but such studies are often treated with skepticism. FIFA stands to profit not only from initial sales but also from resales on its own platform, where it will charge 15 per cent commissions on both the seller and buyer, meaning it would make $30 from the sale of a $100 ticket. Infantino claimed FIFA had received requests from “over 200 countries in the world.” Infantino, who flew into Miami on a Qatari private jet earlier this week, also spent time in the Trump orbit on Thursday, where he was an attendee at a Board of Peace event hosted by the U.S. president. The body, founded and led by Trump, has so far been shunned by America's allies in NATO, but nations including Hungary, Israel, Belarus, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Argentina and Turkey have joined. Infantino has previously hailed Trump's foreign policy, even presenting him with FIFA's inaugural Peace Prize during the World Cup draw in December. Later that month, an official complaint was submitted to FIFA's Ethics Committee by FairSquare, a non-profit organization and advocacy group which focuses mainly on global labor migration rights, political repression and sport. It alleged “repeated breaches” of FIFA's duty of political neutrality by Infantino, while also requesting an investigation into the process that saw Trump receive the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Jersey is canceling a weeks-long World Cup festival at Liberty State Park in Jersey City and is instead allotting $5 million for fan-zone type experiences throughout the state, officials said Thursday. The FIFA 2026 World Cup tournament is taking place in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and is expected to draw unprecedented interest in New Jersey. MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host eight soccer games, including the final game on July 19. Viewing events will range from large public gatherings to small and mid-sized community watch parties, festivals and street fairs, according to an announcement from Gov. “New Jersey is the beating heart of the 2026 World Cup, and this initiative makes sure that every New Jerseyan — no matter where they live — can be part of this once-in-a-generation moment,” Sherrill said in a statement provided by the governor's office. Jersey City Mayor James Solomon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The World Cup is an unparalleled opportunity to showcase New Jersey to the world and drive real economic impact for our businesses and communities,” said Evan Weiss, CEO of the state Economic Development Authority. “This initiative is about more than soccer — it's about making sure that the energy and investment generated by this global event flows directly to the small businesses, cultural organizations, and neighborhood nonprofits that are the backbone of our state,” Weiss said. Events will be announced in the coming weeks, officials said. Rob Jennings is a journalist whose work has appeared on NJ.com and in the Star-Ledger since 2016.

The new coins celebrate Mexico's third time hosting the World Cup, which it previously hosted in 1970 and 1986. This time around, however, it will host alongside the United States and Canada in an unprecedented tournament across three countries. 📌 México será el primer país en ser anfitrión por tercera ocasión de la Copa Mundial de la FIFA. The coins' design will share key elements. Meanwhile, the reverse will feature a design with motifs alluding to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Senators from various political parties said the commemorative coins highlight the cultural, social and economic importance of football in Mexico, which will host 13 matches across Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. The inaugural game will take place at the Banorte Stadium, formerly known as Azteca Stadium, on June 11. These ones are expected to reduce minting costs and strengthen anti-counterfeiting security.

SEPTA says it has been preparing for World Cup crowds from both service and infrastructure perspectives since last year, well ahead of match days. Improvements have focused on key travel points, such as City Hall and NRG stations. To handle the expected influx of fans traveling to and from matches — particularly at Lincoln Financial Field — SEPTA will adjust service levels on key routes and deploy ambassadors at major stations across the system to assist riders. Officials also say they are coordinating with city leaders and event organizers on finalized service plans, expected to be completed by spring. More details will be posted on SEPTA.org as the tournament approaches. WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 05: FIFA World Cup Trophy is displayed prior to the FIFA World Cup 2026 Official Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on December 05, 2025 in Washington, DC. With Philadelphia hosting games featuring some of the biggest names in international soccer and welcoming thousands of visitors into the city, transportation demand is expected to surge on match days — making transit planning and infrastructure readiness critical to keeping crowds moving smoothly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home > International > FIFA Club World Cup 2029 Expansion to 48 Teams Gains UEFA Backing This is a huge shift, especially after years of tension where both sides were constantly at odds over international calendar congestion and how much football players could actually handle. The breakthrough came after negotiations in February, where both sides finally found some common ground. FIFA will keep the tournament on a four-year cycle. By sticking to a four-year schedule, FIFA effectively buried the “biennial” dream which was an idea long opposed by UEFA. The agreement was made possible after FIFA committed to keeping the tournament on its current four-year cycle, ruling out the idea of holding it every two years. The increase acts as a safety net for European clubs, as it would widen access for the big ones that previously failed to qualify, including powerhouses such as Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United. More interestingly, African football could be represented by 6 or 7 clubs. For UEFA, the additional places mitigate competitive and commercial risks. For FIFA, broader European representation strengthens broadcast value and global appeal. It's the perfect chance for them to test their operations on a huge scale just one year before they team up with Portugal for the 2030 World Cup Despite the UEFA-FIFA alignment, opposition has not disappeared. The World Leagues Association and players' union FIFPRO continue to push back, arguing that further expansion intensifies player workload and increases injury risk in an already saturated calendar. If it's approved, this should be a total transformation of the game and probably the most significant structural change in global club football since the competition's modern relaunch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clubs who did not play are to get solidarity payments Frustration is growing among clubs globally at the extended wait for £185m of solidarity payments promised by Fifa on the back of last summer's Club World Cup. If shared equally it would amount to about £50,000 for every top-flight club in the world but, more than seven months after the Club World Cup's conclusion, there is no sign of the money and no timescale for its distribution. There is no suggestion that the windfall will go unpaid but clubs in smaller leagues are growing particularly impatient. The £740m set aside as prize money is understood to have been released; the winners, Chelsea, are thought to have earned about £84m. An executive from one of Europe's smaller leagues told the Guardian there had been no clear answers about when their clubs will be paid despite continued inquiries. In environments where domestic television rights deals are increasingly precarious, and in certain cases nonexistent, a five-figure windfall has the potential to be a lifeline. Numerous clubs, including some on other continents, have painted a similar picture. In Europe there is a perception that Fifa has dragged its feet on reaching a final formula for the payments' distribution. In practice, clubs are highly unlikely to receive identical amounts. Additionally, most confederations do not have a mechanism for distributing such payments. Uefa has experience of handing out solidarity funds to clubs that do not qualify for the league phase of European club competitions and is likely to employ a similar formula when the final sums are known. Fifa sources said they were in regular discussions with the confederations and clubs about how the money will be distributed, and that they wanted all stakeholders to benefit from what they regard as successful tournament. A source from the Union of European Clubs (UEC), which represents more than 140 non-elite clubs around Europe, said none of its members had received any information about when payments might be received. “UEC as an organisation has not heard anything and no member clubs we have consulted with have heard anything either,” they said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supporters across the world have reacted with disbelief as prices for the expanded tournament in North America reached unprecedented levels, sparking accusations of profiteering, frustration among loyal fans, and renewed debates over access to soccer's biggest stage. Amid the storm, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has remained a central figure in defending the tournament's commercial model, while insisting that demand has never been higher. The controversy intensified after resale listings revealed staggering prices for major matches. Tickets for the opening match in Mexico City were listed at more than $5,300, compared with an original price of $895, while a single seat for the final in New Jersey reached a jaw-dropping $143,750 — more than 40 times its original value. Fan organizations accused FIFA of betraying its core audience, arguing that soccer's biggest tournament is drifting further away from ordinary supporters. The passionate fans who end up with outrageous offers,” said France supporters' group Irresistibles Francais. FIFA attempted to soften the backlash by introducing a $60 “Supporter Entry Tier” ticket, but critics argued that the limited allocation — just 10% of tickets distributed through national associations — was symbolic rather than transformative. Every match is sold out,” he said in an interview with CNBC. According to the FIFA president, 508 million ticket requests were submitted in just four weeks for roughly seven million available tickets, with applications coming from more than 200 countries. “We've never seen anything like that — incredible,” he added, noting that FIFA deliberately kept some tickets in reserve for a final sales phase starting in April and running until the final on July 19. Everybody wants to be part of something special,” he said. He explained that although official ticket prices are fixed, dynamic pricing models and resale platforms allow prices to fluctuate based on market demand, adding, “That's part of the market we are in.” Beyond ticket sales, Infantino painted a picture of unprecedented economic impact. He estimated the tournament would generate more than $11 billion in revenue for FIFA, claiming “every dollar” would be reinvested in soccer across its 211 member associations. He also projected that the World Cup could contribute around $30 billion to the US economy, driven by tourism, catering, security, and infrastructure investments. In addition, between 20 and 30 million tourists are expected, alongside 185,000 full-time jobs created by the event. “It's a big impact… I hope this impact will not just be limited to the World Cup but for the future as well,” Infantino said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the Haitian men's soccer team qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, its first time since 1974, it did so without being able to play in its home stadium or train inside the beleaguered country. We're very proud of this," said Regine Etienne, Haiti's acting consular general in Boston. "Their journey demonstrates that there is still hope for Haiti, and that determination and talent can triumph despite adversity." Making the World Cup can have that kind of power for a small or troubled country. Haitians, like citizens from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Iran, face almost a complete travel ban under Trump Administration policy. Despite pleas from those countries, there is no indication President Donald Trump will relent, or that FIFA will pressure the U.S. to make an exception for those who want to travel to the World Cup. As of Jan. 1, the Trump administration expanded its visa-issuance suspensions to nationals from 39 countries, citing national security and public safety concerns and saying the identified countries could not properly vet their citizens. Under the policy, known formally as Presidential Proclamation 10998, players, team officials and immediate family members from the four countries will be granted visas. While the policy allows for some other exceptions -- including those that "would serve the U.S. national interest" --  a State Department spokesman said in an email that those would be "quite rare." The Haitian government "is actively exploring all possible options," Etienne said. One hope for the four World Cup countries might be New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who had what observers found to be a surprisingly cordial Oval Office meeting with the Republican president in November. In a recent interview with ESPN, Mamdani would not say whether he had spoken to Trump -- "I'll keep conversations between the president and myself private" -- but said he intends to advocate for affected communities in any way he can. "It is an opportunity to be seen by a world that often overlooks you. Mamdani, known for his love of soccer, hosted a watch party for the Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal last month, the first of what he says will be numerous events celebrating New York's immigrant communities. A White House spokesman would not say whether the president had spoken to Mamdani or would consider a travel ban appeal, saying in an email, "Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the FIFA World Cup 2026 will be one of the greatest and most spectacular events in the history of mankind, right here in the United States of America. Haiti, Senegal and Iran will play all their group-stage games in the United States. The Ivory Coast, on the other hand, plays its second group stage game in Toronto, where Canada has a strict vetting process but not a blanket ban. It's also possible that teams could advance to knockout games in Canada or Mexico, a long shot for all but Senegal. Sheck Wes, a Senegalese-American hip hop artist raised in New York City, said the ban not only prohibits Senegalese tourists from sharing their passion with World Cup crowds, but also keeps other Americans from seeing a vibrant community that wants to contribute to the event. When the Trump administration announced the bans, it said nationals from the named countries "have been involved with crimes that include murder, terrorism, embezzling public funds, human smuggling, human trafficking, and other criminal activity." The policy has been attacked by Democrats and a number of civil and human rights organizations as being discriminatory, with Human Rights First describing the policy as "racist" and "a sweeping act of collective punishment." Jonathan Grode, a prominent immigration lawyer in Philadelphia, said the inflexibility on immigration runs counter to the Trump Administration's own business instincts. "And that is really what's coming to a head here." Asked whether FIFA might push for an exemption to the ban, a spokesman for the organization pointed out that FIFA has worked with the Trump administration to create an expedited visa interview process for anyone holding a World Cup ticket. FIFA is not involved in host country immigration processes." Critics said they think FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has grown close to Trump and awarded the American president the inaugural FIFA peace prize, should press his friend for an exemption. "It's very difficult to process," said Lionel Lucien, a Haitian-American community leader in Boston, where Haiti will play its World Cup opener. "There are people over there that would love to come and that qualify based on some of the requirements. One retired veteran U.S. diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the U.S. has legitimate concerns about vetting people from poor or unstable countries seeking tourist visas. Haiti and Iran faced restrictions in previous administrations: "Tourist visas for them are basically rare, if not impossible, to get, and some of it is just logistics," the former diplomat said. But, he said, a total ban is an extreme reaction. "And the vetting is quite justified when an Iranian is not an ex-pat or a dissident, someone we already know. "They're not just hostile (to the United States) but they're not sharing information that lets us trust in their identities and their passports. According to Department of Homeland Security data, Haitians who have received visas over the past several years have overstayed the terms of their visas at a rate far beyond any other country in the World Cup. "For Haiti this is not just about soccer, it's about dignity and visibility," said James "Reggie" Colimon, a Haitian American who is director of global affairs and protocol for Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. "Sport is supposed to unite the world, but Haiti can't participate? "When you single out one nation while welcoming others, it creates a credibility gap. No one will ever dispute security doesn't matter, but there's an inconsistency in the way we're doing things.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Football will win,” said Nasser Al-Khelaifi (below), the chairman of football's reigning European champions, Paris Saint-Germain, and one of football's most powerful administrators, as he addressed UEFA's Congress in Brussels last week. Real Madrid briefed that they had won. UEFA's president, Aleksander Ceferin, echoed Al-Khelaifi's words and said that football was the winner. “This agreement of principles will also serve to resolve their legal disputes related to the European Super League, once such principles are executed and implemented.” A senior UEFA official indicated to Sporting Intelligence that Real Madrid had gained little. They have returned to the European establishment in different circumstances. UEFA's annual financial report discloses as much, saying: “We also transferred the management, sale and delivery of all media, sponsorship and licensing rights to our elite men's and women's club competitions to UC3, a UEFA-EFC joint venture.” It should be stressed: this is all up for grabs and proposals remain in their infancy. But the bottom line is that Europe's “biggest” clubs - Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, and the major clubs from the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A will have enhanced chances of success, and crucially, enhanced chances of making more money, under any reformatted version of the CL. Those funds, it is understood, come from UEFA club competitions. On page 29, UEFA's 2024-25 financial report discloses: “€25m was allocated to European Football Clubs (EFC) in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed by UEFA and EFC.” In total, over the course of multiple seasons, an estimated €96m has flown from UEFA to the EFC. With this cash going to the EFC rather than to clubs who might (should) have earned it via European competition, it means lots of clubs have lost out on income. Aston Villa (€631,000) and Celtic (€1.2m) are among dozens and dozens of clubs to miss out on extra revenue because of the money going to the EFC from UEFA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Final Round of qualifiers will be held between March 17-22, 2026, at the Costa Rican Football Federation headquarters in San Rafael, Alajuela. With the world championship now staged annually and expanded from 16 to 24 nations, instead of a tournament in which the top three Concacaf finishers qualify for the Women's U-17 World Cup, 12 teams were drawn into three groups of four teams each with the winner of each group and the best second place team qualifying for the World Cup, set for October-November 2026 in Morocco. For Round One, 28 nations – all ranked fifth and below based on the Concacaf U-17 Women's Ranking – were split into six groups. After round-robin play between January 24 and February 2, eight teams progressed to the Final Round, joining the Confederation's four best-ranked teams. The Final Round will also be played in a group format with three groups of four teams each. The 12 participating teams are: Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States who were all pre-seeded; Dominican Republic, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, which were the six Round One group winners; and Bermuda and Nicaragua, which were the best second-place finishers in Round One. With the expanded annual U-17 Women's World Cup, the Concacaf region has been allocated an additional fourth berth. Last year's change in format means the USA can no longer win a Concacaf U-17 Women's Championship, of which it has won six and the most recent four in a row. Just three countries thus far have qualified for the 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. In addition to host Morocco, New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via 2025 OFC U-16 Women's Championship.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEATTLE — As millions of fans prepare to travel for the FIFA World Cup™ this summer, Airbnb announced the launch of what it calls its largest new host incentive program to encourage residents in host cities to rent out their homes during the tournament. According to estimates from Deloitte, residents in host cities like Seattle could earn an average of $3,000 by listing their space on Airbnb during the event. RELATED | Seattle's World Cup CEO talks volunteers, small biz impacts, security Seattle FIFA World Cup 2026 organizing committee released its logo in January 2025. Searches for stays in host cities are up 80% year-over-year as fans begin making plans to attend matches and related events, according to Airbnb. Local hosts in the region are projected to earn an average of $3,800 by renting their homes on Airbnb during the event. Airbnb said it is actively seeking new hosts to help meet the anticipated surge in demand for accommodations during the FIFA World Cup™, positioning home sharing as a way for residents to benefit financially while helping to accommodate visiting fans. New entire home hosts in any of the 16 World Cup cities across the US, Canada, and Mexico who welcome their first guests between now and July 31, 2026, are eligible to earn a $750 USD bonus, Airbnb said. Beyond individual host earnings, Airbnb said its activity is expected to have a broader economic impact. The company cited Deloitte estimates that direct spending through Airbnb bookings could generate approximately $260 million for the local economy through a multiplier effect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former LSU Soccer defender Sydney Cheesman has earned a call-up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team, announced by the U.S. Soccer Federation on Wednesday. Cheesman is one of 24 players that have been called up to the first U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp of 2026, which will run from Feb. 27 to March 7 in South Florida. U.S. U-23 WNT head coach Heather Dyche will train a squad featuring 21 professional players – 19 from the NWSL and two from the USL Super League – along with three current collegiate players. The camp will end with two matches against the Mexico U-23 Women's National Team, on March 3 at Noon ET and March 6 at 2 p.m. ET, both at the FIU Soccer Stadium in Miami. The selection marks LSU Soccer's third Tiger to earn a national team call-up just this week. Previously, current freshman Sariyah Bailey received a call-up to the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team, while former Tiger and teammate of Cheesman, Ida Hermannsdottir, got named to the full Icelandic Women's National Team. In addition to her defensive contributions, Cheesman tallied two goals and seven assists during her time in the Purple and Gold. After transferring to LSU in 2024, Cheesman quickly established herself as a vital piece of the Tigers' defense, bringing experience, consistency and leadership to the squad. U.S. U-23 WNT Roster by Position – (Club/College; Hometown)Domestic Training Camp and Matches — Miami, Fla. LSU's soccer team successfully bounced back from its worst loss of the season with a 6-0 victory Sunday over Texas A&M Commerce at the LSU Soccer Stadium.
