                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"You took something from us..." Shudder has unveiled their freaky official trailer for a new indie horror film called Bodycam, another new found footage horror. This one is being pitched as Cops meets Paranormal Activity, with a dash of Event Horizon thrown in (when the s&!t hits the fan). Two police officers investigate a domestic dispute but there's an accidental shooting. According to reviews, it's "equipped with plenty of scares, yet also deeper overtones of how people lose their humanity in the participation of systemic evil (policing in this case). Though other critics say that it "would've worked so much better as a V/H/S segment." Bodycam film stars Jaime Callica, Sean Rogerson, Catherine Lough Haggquist, Angel Prater, and Keegan Connor Tracy. Have a look if you want some horror blending "visceral dread with cosmic terror." Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Brandon Christensen's horror film Bodycam, direct from YouTube: Not wanting to be crucified by the public, the officers attempt to cover it up – only to reveal that their body cameras aren't the only things watching them. Bodycam, also known as 911: Llamada Infernal in Spanish or POV: Presença Oculta in Portuguese, is directed by Canadian genre filmmaker / VFX artist Brandon Christensen, director of the horror movies Still/Born, Z, Superhost, The Puppetman, and Night of the Reaper previously, plus many other shorts. Produced by Chris Ball, Brandon Christensen, Kurtis David Harder. Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, To Watch, Trailer Want emails instead?Subscribe to our dailynewsletter updates:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressman Eric Burlison has claimed he heard reports of a crashed alien craft “so large it cannot be moved.” Burlison says he hasn't personally verified the craft, as it comes down to politicians' jurisdictions being closed off when investigating classified materials: “I'm having a difficult time getting access to facilities that are just within a few miles from my office in Washington, DC,” he added. As the case for governmental transparency gains traction, Burlison remains committed: Burlison's comments follow up on a recent observation about UAP videos from a Pentagon briefing, addressing the frustration of slow communication at the top regarding UFO disclosure. Meanwhile, in the same interview, Dr. Steven Greer claims multiple alien craft have been “brought down,” some “bigger than a football field.” It was so huge they had to build a structure around it.” Greer stipulated he was able to mention this as he is not bound by the same confidential terms as Burlison. Greer also mentioned another craft near Fort Sill, Oklahoma, allegedly concealed by a structure, though it wasn't as elaborate as the Korean site, suggesting a highly cordoned-off area stateside. These claims come amid renewed interest in UFOs, following recent remarks by Barack Obama on The Brian Tyler Cohen Show: “They're real, but I haven't seen them.” Obama later clarified that he had been participating in a quick-fire round of questioning, with the interview not necessarily centered around UAP disclosure – unlike some of his more leftfield contemporaries. An unprotected database, likely containing know-your-customer (KYC) data, has spilled vast amounts of personal records across multiple countries, including the USA, Germany, France, China, Brazil, and many more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to speak about aliens and extraterrestrial spacecraft present on Earth. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, claimed on a podcast that the president refused to come clean when she asked about aliens, but she has heard about a speech. The 43-year-old was speaking on the New York Post's Pod Force One podcast, where she stated that her father-in-law was being "really coy" when she and Eric (her husband) asked him if he knew something about extraterrestrials. Talking to podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama seemingly confirmed the existence of extraterrestrials. Host Miranda Devine asked Lara if Trump is preparing to make an announcement on aliens. “Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won't even fully tell us, maybe there's more to it,'” she said. “I have just heard kind of around that he's actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don't know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.

A few days ago, he reportedly permitted the release of all information on secret UFO facilities in the United States, such as Area 51. US Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri had sought permission from the president to visit these secure locations tied to UFOs and secret government projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After posting impressive numbers during the Feb 13-15 weekend, the film collected $1.3 million on its third Monday, a 46.8% drop from Sunday but a strong 37.8% jump from last Monday. With an additional $0.9 million earned on Tuesday, the film's domestic total has climbed to $49.9 million, making it the highest-grossing release of 2026 so far in North America, according to Box Office Mojo's annual chart. At the worldwide box office, Send Help has surpassed 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple ($57.6 million) and was recently overtaken by Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi's steamy romance Wuthering Heights ($92 million). Let's take a closer look at how the two films stack up at the domestic and global box office, based on Box Office Mojo data: Based on the above figures, Send Help is just $4.1 million away from surpassing Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension worldwide, a gap it could close within a few days if its current momentum holds. Interestingly, Sam Raimi's survival horror has performed significantly stronger in North America, earning nearly three times the domestic total of the 2015 found-footage sequel. However, The Ghost Dimension holds a clear advantage overseas. If Send Help maintains steady international legs with a solid domestic run, it is well-placed to overtake the franchise entry globally in the coming days. The film features a high-concept survival story centered on Linda (Rachel McAdams), an underappreciated employee, and Bradley (Dylan O'Brien), her difficult boss. Now, the two must set aside their differences and work together to survive in these harsh conditions. Stay tuned to Koimoi for more box office updates!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She hasn't slept well, partly because of an argument she had with Pat Newcomb, her publicist turned close friend, the night before. Marilyn invited Pat to stay over at Fifth Helena Drive, her home in Los Angeles, because she is suffering from bronchitis and the actress thought a little rest and sunbathing would benefit her. At 9am, she eats a grapefruit – or, according to another account, drinks a glass of grapefruit juice – and chats to Eunice Murray, her “devoted assistant” and housekeeper, who is due to spend the day at the house. The actress does a little light gardening and takes delivery of a bedside table and some fruit trees that Murray will plant in the garden. At around noon, Marilyn's former father-in-law, Isidore Miller – to whom she is still close despite the divorce from [her third husband, playwright] Arthur – phones the house, but Murray tells him Marilyn is dressing and will call him back. She receives many calls congratulating her on the interview with Richard Meryman for Life magazine, which has just hit the newsstands. Just after noon, Pat emerges from the guest room, having had more than 12 hours of sleep – a luxury beyond Marilyn's wildest imaginings and something that seems to enrage her. Pat enjoys an omelette cooked by Murray and made with herbs from the garden, but Marilyn eats nothing. At some point during the early afternoon, Marilyn asks Murray whether there is any oxygen in the house, a question that strikes the housekeeper as so strange that she rings Dr [Ralph] Greenson, Marilyn's psychiatrist, to ask for his advice; he tells her he will call by at some point later. “She was unhappy and complained about [Pat Newcomb] again, about not sleeping well, but after I had spent about two and a half hours with her, she seemed to quiet down,” he wrote in a letter to Marilyn's friend, the poet Norman Rosten. Greenson suggests that it would be better if Newcomb leave the house, which she does. Greenson picks up the phone and when Roberts asks to speak to Marilyn, he informs him she isn't at home and hangs up. After the session with Greenson is over, Marilyn tells him that she'd like to go for a walk on Santa Monica pier – she says it is a place that brings back the few happy memories from her childhood – but the psychiatrist warns her that she is too groggy. Greenson makes Marilyn promise to call him the next morning. About half an hour later, he receives a call from her sounding much brighter – she tells him that the 20-year-old son of another ex-husband, Joe DiMaggio – has just rung to inform her that he isn't going to marry “some awful girl” and she felt “relieved about that”. “I thought perhaps she was just confused,” he said. “Anyway she sounded pleasant on the phone, although somewhat depressed, but by no means acutely so.” At some point between 7pm and 8pm, the actor Peter Lawford calls Marilyn. Earlier on in the day he had invited her to a small dinner party at his Malibu beach house and he wants to check whether she's still coming. During the conversation her voice seems to “fade out” and when he tries to call back her line is busy. Lawford is so concerned by what she says – “Say goodbye to Pat, say goodbye to Jack [JFK], and say goodbye to yourself because you're a nice guy” – that he contacts his manager, Milton Ebbins, who advises him not to go to Fifth Helena Drive – after all, not only has Lawford been drinking but he is the brother-in-law of the president. Ebbins, in turn, at 8.30pm, leaves a message for Marilyn's attorney, Milton Rudin (also Dr Greenson's brother-in-law), to call him. He asks about Marilyn and Murray reassures him that she is in her bedroom and that she is “all right”. At some point that evening, Murray hears the telephone ring again in Marilyn's room. “I don't remember what time the call came in, and I don't know who it was from,” she told the Los Angeles Times a few days after the star's death. “But knowing Marilyn as I do, I think that if this call waked her up [sic] she might have taken some more sleeping pills.” Later, Murray would tell biographer Anthony Summers, “Marilyn had a phobia about sleeping, anything that would deter sleeping, especially after she had taken some sedation, and then she would have to take more – and that's dangerous, she told me that.” Marilyn was so neurotic about not being disturbed that Murray would not knock on the actress's door in case it woke her. (Marilyn had two lines; one of her night-time rituals – to ensure she was not disturbed – was to take the telephones out of her room.) This is important, because official reports give the time of discovery as around 3.30am. According to the official version of events, Murray woke up again at around 3.30am and saw that the phone cord was still under Marilyn's door. Instead, she went outside, looked through the window and saw something that shocked her. “I saw Marilyn lying on the bed – face down, nude,” she said. She was lying face down on the bed, with her shoulders exposed; it was obvious to him that she was dead – “and as I got closer I could see the phone clutched fiercely in her right hand”, he wrote in a letter to Norman Rosten. When Dr Engelberg arrived, he took out his stethoscope, checked Marilyn's pupils and confirmed that she was dead. The two doctors noticed that rigor mortis had set in. They also saw that Marilyn's bedside table was cluttered with bottles of pills. I was thinking just wildly about this horrible, how awful, what on earth is everybody going to do next.” Murray's account is plausible; sometimes people in traumatic situations do lose all sense of time. But her opaqueness – and her surprising failure to note the time on the night of Marilyn's death – left police investigators suspicious. Into the black hole of these few empty hours conspiracy theorists have injected a thousand wild conjectures. Six weeks after Marilyn's death, sergeant Jack Clemmons met with two men who – like him – had a vested interest in digging up dirt on the Kennedys. Clemmons was a director of the Right-wing Fire and Police Research Association of Los Angeles – “If you haven't time to learn more about and to fight communism today,” runs the tagline for one of the organisation's newsletters, “you'd better start getting ready to learn how to live under it tomorrow!” Jim Dougherty, Marilyn's first husband, was a colleague of Clemmons's at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), where Jack was known for his extreme Right-wing views. Clemmons's co-conspirators in a battle to bring down the liberal Kennedy clan – whom they thought were too sympathetic to far-Left causes – were Maurice Ries, president of the anti-communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, and private detective turned Right-wing propagandist Frank Capell. Ries had heard a rumour that Marilyn had been having an affair with Robert Kennedy, then attorney general; according to hearsay, he had promised to marry her, but when he changed his mind she was so angry and bitter she threatened to expose him. (In fact, they misunderstood and misinterpreted the physical evidence: not all of those who die by overdose have traces of the drugs left in their stomachs.) Like in a terrible whodunnit, Clemmons and Capell gathered together their suspects in the fetid drawing room of their dark imagination. “Marilyn was deeply involved with Left-wingers and identified Communists and her death has many suspicious aspects to it which we shall attempt to bring out by presenting documented evidence.” Capell calls out many in Marilyn's life as known or suspected communists – Arthur Miller, Dr Engelberg, Norman and Hedda Rosten [writers and friends of Monroe], Lee and Paula Strasberg [her acting teachers] – but he leaves the reader in little doubt as to who was to blame for Marilyn's death: Robert Kennedy. “If Marilyn's death were really murder dressed up to look like an accident or suicide, who would have wanted her out of [the] way?” Capell asks. “The most likely [suspect] would be an ambitious man, already important but wanting to become more important and knowing that a serious scandal might ruin his chances for the biggest job of all. Would he take a gun and shoot her or personally involve himself in the dirty work? Marilyn, already surrounded by doubtful people, was easy game.” In an unpublished letter, written to lawyer and fellow Right-wing activist Helen Clay, dated September 3 1964, Capell admitted to using the Monroe case for his own political ends. He said that if Kennedy was elected senator, “I am afraid he will become the unofficial ‘Dictator' in Congress, since he has the support of every known Left-winger group, liberal group etc, etc…” Kennedy – whose 1960 book The Enemy Within documented his battle with corrupt labour unions – believed that Hoover used his connections to the mob to try to dig up dirt on the Kennedy family. Hoover was so thrilled by Capell's central allegation that he took the trouble to write Robert Kennedy a memo that read, “Mr Capell stated he will indicate in his book that you and Miss Monroe were intimate, and that you were in Miss Monroe's apartment at the time of her death.” However, in the same cache of FBI files, it maintains that “the allegation concerning the attorney general and Miss Monroe has been circulated in the past and has been branded as utterly false”. It spread like wildfire, of course, and J Edgar Hoover was right there, gleefully fanning the flames.” The rumour about Marilyn having an affair first with JFK and then RFK has been branded upon our collective consciousness. The next public event was JFK's birthday celebration, and Democratic gala fundraiser, at Madison Square Garden on May 19 1962, when Marilyn sang Happy Birthday in front of a crowd of 15,000 people. “I can now retire from politics after having had Happy Birthday sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way,” joked the president. Afterwards, Marilyn – together with her date for the evening, Isidore Miller, Arthur's father, and her publicist Pat Newcomb – attended a party at the Manhattan townhouse of [movie studio head] Arthur and Mathilde Krim. Often, in reproduction, the photo is cropped to show only Marilyn and the two Kennedy men, but in reality they were surrounded by a number of other guests. It's clear that if Marilyn and the president – who, despite his philandering nature, had a public image as a happy family man – were conducting an affair, they would want to keep it out of the public eye. In various biographies there have been dozens of witnesses – some more reliable than others – who have testified that Marilyn and JFK had been lovers. The statements of Marilyn's friends such as Henry Rosenfeld, her masseur Ralph Roberts and [actress] Susan Strasberg – all of whom confirmed such a relationship between the two – should be taken seriously. Rosenfeld maintained that Marilyn's relationship with JFK started after he became president in 1961 – “She was so excited you'd think she was a teenager” – but that the sexual contact between them was confined to “a very, very few times”. According to Rosenfeld, the couple used to meet up at a place on 53rd Street in New York, and Marilyn travelled to Washington a couple of times, although she never made it into the White House itself. “She would say, ‘I'm going to be with You Know Who again – he's so important',” said Rosenfeld. According to Roberts, Marilyn called JFK “the Gentleman Caller”. At the end of March 1962, she phoned Roberts to tell him that the president had invited her to spend the weekend of 24 to 25 March in Palm Springs, at Bing Crosby's estate. “I'm wearing the black wig, carrying an attaché case. I have an identification card with a picture of me wearing the wig. Tony Roberts.” She went on to say that the president was anxious that she might be identified by her trademark sexy walk. “He says I would be recognised in the deepest part of Africa from it,” she said. From Palm Springs, Marilyn telephoned Roberts again and told him about a conversation she had with a friend – whom he took to be the president – about her walk and her knowledge of physiology. “He [Kennedy] said that the little massaging I did on his back worked wonders,” she told Roberts on another occasion. Those who believe the theory that Robert Kennedy killed Marilyn Monroe – or had her murdered – often cite a taped conversation between Dr Greenson and magician turned celebrity photographer Billy Woodfield, one of the first media representatives to turn up at Fifth Helena Drive in the early hours of August 5 1962. Working with journalist Joe Hyams of the New York Herald Tribune, Woodfield started to “play detective”. The week after Marilyn's death he claimed that he'd discovered from a pilot's log in Santa Monica that a helicopter had been ordered to pick up a passenger from Peter Lawford's beach house in the early hours of August 5 and take them to Los Angeles Airport. “It showed clearly that a helicopter had picked up Robert Kennedy at the Santa Monica Beach,” Woodfield said. Woodfield and Hyams realised that if this were true, they had a big scoop on their hands and requested a comment from Robert Kennedy's office, which reportedly asked them not to run the story. During his research, Woodfield tracked down Dr Greenson and recorded their subsequent telephone conversation. Greenson's taped testimony suggested that Robert Kennedy was the person to blame for Marilyn's death. However, an examination of the whole taped conversation, instead of this edited segment, casts the so-called revelation in an entirely different light. Woodfield asks Greenson whether he will sit down with him for a proper interview. This is the subject they are talking about when Greenson makes his famous “Listen – talk to Bobby Kennedy” comment. Rather, they are discussing the possible impact of Capell's pamphlet. Billy Woodfield: It's [Capell's book] going to break all over New York City just before the election. [Bobby Kennedy was standing to be New York senator, a position he secured in November 1964.] Dr Greenson: Well, when that happens – listen – talk to Bobby Kennedy. In fact, Robert Kennedy was nowhere near Fifth Helena Drive on August 4 or 5 1962. A set of 15 photographs taken over the course of that weekend places the attorney general, his wife, Ethel, and their four children, together with their hosts, John and Nancy Bates, at a ranch in Gilroy, northern California – over 300 miles away from LA. The Kennedy family arrived at the country home of Bates – a prominent Californian lawyer and a friend of JFK's from his navy days – on Friday August 3 and stayed until August 5. As Pat Newcomb stated in an unpublished interview, “Everyone tried to make something out of the most glamorous people of that particular era. I do not think she meant to kill herself. With each passing year, Marilyn's fame seems to grow. She is featured in films, fashion spreads, advertising, novels, poetry, opera, video games and plays. And soon, she will be celebrated in a major exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, to mark what would have been her 100th birthday. It's no surprise that because Marilyn's life was cut short, we will always want to imagine the possibilities for the time she had left. Towards the end of his life, director John Huston was asked about Marilyn's continuing appeal. He paused and then replied, “Well, simply that she's still alive.” Extracted from I Wanna Be Loved By You: Marilyn Monroe, A Life in 100 Takes by Andrew Wilson, published on Feb 26 (Simon & Schuster, £25)</p>

However, once in office, Carter changed his stance, saying releasing certain information could harm national security. In a famous 1987 speech at the United Nations, Reagan said humanity's divisions might disappear if Earth faced an extraterrestrial threat. Clinton later joked that he hoped any alien encounter would not resemble the hostile invasion portrayed in Hollywood films.
