                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin transactions, by contrast, typically cost under one percent. That gap is the reason behind a move that didn't exactly make a splash when 360 Private Travel announced it would begin accepting cryptocurrency for client payments in early February. Crypto and digital currency have, after all, been hovering around the edges of luxury travel for a few years. News about its development has been sporadic at best: a hotel announcement here, a boutique agency there, and perhaps a handful of exceptional cases that have never quite caught on to inspire broader adoption across the industry. Until now, only a small number of agencies have publicly acknowledged doing so, including Globe7, as profiled by Luxury Travel Advisor last year as part of that agency's London debut. “We've seen more and more of our HNW clients asking for this over the last six to nine months,” said James Turner, CEO of 360 Private Travel, in a video interview with LTA shortly following the announcement. But one other critical distinction also sits at the center of 360's approach. The immediate association when anything about digital currency comes up is volatility. “This is not a wildly fluctuating asset,” Turner said. “If we speak about stablecoin…the risk is near to zero,” confirmed Simone Urracci via email. Despite resistance that still surrounds crypto in the travel industry, however justified, stablecoins are not designed to be held in the hope they appreciate. They are designed to move money quickly, predictably, and across borders, all powered by blockchain technology. To minimize exposure even further, Turner explained that, for now, 360 converts incoming stablecoin payments into fiat currency on a daily basis. No assets are being held overnight, and the agency isn't betting on currency fluctuations to pad its coffers. Rather, crypto is being treated as an alternative rail for cheaper and faster cross-border transfers. As more suppliers begin to accept digital currency themselves, agencies could transact end-to-end in stablecoins — converting only residual balances back into fiat when needed. But that phase depends on supplier readiness and additional infrastructure. The space has its own intricate language, and it's easy to get lost as the discussion inevitably touches on wallets, blockchains, or some other esoteric term. Luca De Giglio, a researcher who has spent years studying digital currency adoption in the travel sector, offers a metaphor that helps distill the concept. The jump in speed, efficiency, and cost reduction is significant.” The existing payment infrastructure that underpins global travel was never designed for real-time, cross-border commerce. It relies on layers of intermediaries, cut-off times, confirmations, opaque FX rates, and reconciliation processes that remain stubbornly manual. As LTA reported earlier this year in an investigation into commission delays and foreign exchange fees, the costs borne by the travel industry — particularly travel agencies — are significant. In some cases, foreign exchange alone pushes that figure even higher. For an agency doing hundreds of millions in sales annually, reducing the cost of processing by even a few percentage points has a direct impact on the bottom line. Speed matters as much as cost: Crypto also offers fewer reconciliation steps, faster settlement, transparent FX, 24/7 operation, and less time spent tracing payments or resolving discrepancies. “In our market it would mean less cost of transaction, less time to receive commission, and a very efficient way of payment,” said Urracci. “Unfortunately, we are very far from that due to continuous change in European regulation on crypto.” Fraud prevention, internal authorizations, cybersecurity, and auditability all become more critical when transactions are high value. Fraud is inevitable when you're dealing with millions of dollars,” said Turner. 360 has relied on its own technology stack to manage those challenges — building in multiple authorization layers and tightly controlled workflows. The investment required for that approach is not as easily replicated by a small, standalone agency; though, Globe7's example suggests the boutique model isn't without precedent. While Dubai has emerged as a crypto hub, Turner is clear that 360's new UAE office was not the driver of this move. Some new developments are being designed to attract digital entrepreneurs and globally mobile capital — Zanzibar's proposed "Cyber City" being one example of how destinations themselves are beginning to position around digital finance, not just as a tourism story but as an economic infrastructure play. In contrast to Dubai, the UK remains more conservative from a regulatory and cultural standpoint, which makes implementation more complex, according to Turner. Supplier settlements are the next logical phase, and Turner estimates that meaningful supplier engagement could begin within six months once systems are ready to operate at scale. “If it returns more value to advisors and squeezes out unnecessary costs, that's good for the industry, for the ecosystem,” he said. Crypto will not solve the luxury travel industry's payment problems overnight. But 360's move represents something more substantial than a pilot. An agency with more than 200 advisors across 60 countries claiming they made six figures in crypto payments within weeks of adoption would, if true, be a notable step forward in whether the industry can modernize how its money moves. The travel industry's payment infrastructure has lagged other sectors for years. For agencies willing to engage seriously with the mechanics, stablecoins may offer a way to leapfrog some of that history — not by speculating on a new asset class, but by replacing an expensive and slow one with something faster, cheaper, and already working. The question now is whether suppliers and host agencies move quickly enough to meet them there. Jacques Ledbetter is a Luxury Travel Advisor contributor and founder of The Luxe Ledger newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, offered a blunt take on digital assets, arguing that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin BTC$66,510.36 and stablecoins, have yet to prove real utility. Speaking at the 2026 Midwest Economic Outlook Summit in Fargo, North Dakota on Thursday, he contrasted the everyday utility of artificial intelligence (AI) tools with cryptocurrencies. "Crypto has been around for more than a decade, and it's utterly useless," he said, while AI "has real long term potential for the U.S. After asking the audience who had used AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini in the past week, Kashkari posed a second question: "raise your hand if you've bought or sold something with bitcoin." Pressed on stablecoins being used for cheaper and faster cross-border payments, Kashkari argued that proponents quickly concede that those benefits aren't aimed at U.S. consumers. While stablecoin advocates promise instant transfers, he said, recipients still need to convert into local currency for everyday payments like buying groceries, which can be expensive. Kashkari's skepticism stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration, which has increasingly championed bitcoin and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins as key strategic tools. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued that regulated stablecoins can extend the greenback's dominance in global payments and reinforce its status as the world's reserve currency, strengthening U.S. financial influence. A deep look at predictions on Kalshi called such platforms valuable to policymakers and researchers, according to a new Fed paper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former investment fund chief who embezzled almost $40 million in Bitcoin from Georgia's former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili has been released from prison. He was later arrested on the border with Azerbaijan and transferred to prison to serve his sentence, with courts ordering him to serve a further four years for illegal flight, the Russian-language media outlet Vzglad reported. But after striking a plea deal, Bachiashvili's sentence was reduced, and he was allowed to walk free. “Bachiashvili has fully admitted his guilt to all the criminal charges,” prosecutors told Georgian broadcaster Channel 1. Regulatory data published late last year shows the Bitcoin mining sector's power consumption tripled in the first 10 months of 2025, reaching 617 million kilowatt-hours. This represents 5% of the nation's total electricity consumption. Ivanishvili is one of the richest people in Georgia and wields enormous political influence. Instead of doing so, prosecutors said, Bachiashvili embezzled the coins. Prosecutors also indicted Bachiashvili's parents, accusing them of aiding their son's efforts to launder $3.5 million worth of Cartu's Bitcoin. Prosecution officials have also dropped these charges. Prosecutors said that, under the terms of the plea deal, Bachiashvili's sentence was reduced to a suspended one-year jail term. Bachiashvili has also agreed to pay a $19,000 fine. Most of Georgia's data centres focus their efforts on crypto mining, with the majority of miners based in Tbilisi and Kutaisi's free industrial zones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doc.com Expands U.S. Rollout with Florida Launch, Advancing AI-Powered Blockchain Secured Healthcare Access NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Doc.com, the pioneering healthcare technology company redefining access to care through artificial intelligence and blockchain integration, today announced the launch of its telemedicine platform in Florida as part of its ongoing United States expansion. Through a seamless mobile experience, Florida residents can now connect with licensed healthcare professionals within the state for secure, convenient telehealth consultations. As part of its introductory experience, new users may access complimentary teleconsultation, available in eligible jurisdictions and subject to applicable regulations. These minutes may be used across one or multiple sessions as part of an initial trial. Complimentary consultation time does not apply to emergency services and does not create a patient-provider relationship until formally established in accordance with applicable state laws. “Florida represents a critical step in our U.S. expansion strategy,” said Charles Nader, CEO and Founder of Doc.com. Our AI-driven infrastructure supports providers while empowering patients with secure, affordable access to healthcare services.” Doc.com's broader U.S. rollout began with Phase 1 launches in West Virginia and continues through additional phases across 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and operational readiness, with nationwide availability targeted for early 2027. Florida's activation strengthens the company's footprint in high-demand markets and reinforces its commitment to scaling accessible care across diverse communities. Beyond telemedicine, Doc.com is building a vertically integrated healthcare ecosystem that connects physical health, mental health, pharmacy services, veterinary care, and education within one unified platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These include independence from American payment providers, security in case those American providers cut off access, the convenience of digital cash, now that notes and coins are used less, and offline sales. But there is a bigger and better reason: monetary sovereignty and the credibility of the euro itself. The European Union should not take the risk that a public void triggers the private sector to develop something that catches on and becomes widespread, then collapses and threatens financial stability. If there is a digital euro, it will be easier for the ECB to differentiate between its own integrity and market ventures, and thus to defend the currency while letting market discipline run its course. Mostly, investors appreciate the euro area's many accomplishments. But there have been times – the 2010-2015 crisis period, for example – when the currency's inherent fragmentation has become a significant vulnerability. Rather than weighing whether, say, an Italian bond is as good as one from Cyprus, or what the spread between Estonia and Germany should be, investors just run. If a startup or an emerging-market country ruins itself using dollars, that company or country's poor management gets the blame. For example, a private-sector stablecoin becoming the market default and then stumbling could trigger renewed fear of a euro-area breakup. This could be because of imbalances in the sovereign bonds held as backing assets, alarming investors about diverging credit risk among euro countries. Or a more general run could be prompted by breaking a peg, in the same way that failing money-market funds have set off crises before. Other factors not yet on the radar could also arise. But it will be better able to prevent and contain them if it already occupies all senior digital currency positions. This means a wholesale digital euro for cross-border payment and settlement and a retail version for everyday use – with the main reason for this distinction being process, not a difference in need. The ECB can do a wholesale version by itself, while retail money requires EU legislation alongside central bank planning. Digital-euro supporters often argue that the EU should not depend on Visa and Mastercard and needs a homegrown alternative to assure payment sovereignty. Opponents say the private sector is capable of generating more options to meet demand, and they note that the EU already has a strong bank-transfer protocol and widely available instant payments. Furthermore, in the unlikely event of Washington moving to cut off access to the card networks, many other things would likely have already gone wrong, including the fracturing of NATO and an end to decades of security cooperation. In that context, having to pay with cash or direct bank debit would be a manageable problem. This, in turn, will position the euro to increase its international role. Even a weak dollar is still the global reference point, because financial plumbing is more important than comparative value when it comes to managing foreign reserves. To the extent that global central banks seek to protect themselves from US political risk, they buy gold or consult with the Fed, rather than making big moves into other currencies. The retail and wholesale digital euro are vital to that process. The EU is updating its regulations on securitisation, but it still has a long way to go if it wants to emulate the strengths of the US market At this event, Sharon Donnery discussed the ECB's recommendations within banking-sector policy How can public money and financial markets work together to protect the environment?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's your quick hit of the week's biggest stories. AML RULES still vary wildly across the EU - something which certain crypto companies are looking to take advantage of. Claudia Buch, Chair of the ECB (European Central Bank) Supervisory Board, warned that some crypto firms are choosing to operate in EU countries with ‘lighter' compliance controls. “The evolving crypto-asset sector is particularly vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing,” she said. And increase the risk of high-risk firms strategically choosing countries with lighter AML controls.” A full list of the new board members and their backgrounds is available [HERE]. , Co-Founder and CEO, said: “Compliance today is mostly human glue between systems that were never designed to work together. And institutions finally get a complete, defensible record of how every decision was made.” The Summit takes place as Europe's AFC, AML, FCC and Fraud agenda is entering a defining phase. Across the industry, leaders are grappling with the same hard questions – Crypto Regulations, AMLA expectations, MiCA execution, FATF scrutiny, fintech and BaaS risk, sanctions evasion and fraud escalations. BRETTON: Finally, US firm Bretton AI has raised $75 million in a Series B round led by Sapphire Ventures, as it looks to further develop its AI-powered anti-financial crime platform. Additionally, the company has also rebranded, changing its name from Greenlite AI. ☝️ We have special offers for Individual and Corporate Members.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emails from 2018 indicate Epstein told former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that Gensler had arrived early for crypto-related discussions, according to the documents. Additional claims in the reports suggest Epstein provided funding for U.S. central bank digital currency pilot programs through MIT and certain Federal Reserve Banks. Reports also indicate Epstein explored early stablecoin-related investments, including Circle, through connections associated with Brock Pierce. Pierce reportedly requested Epstein's assistance in connecting with Lawrence Summers, according to accounts of the correspondence. The documents suggest Epstein maintained investments in private cryptocurrency ventures while maintaining relationships with academic and policy circles involved in digital currency regulation, according to analysts reviewing the materials. The timing of these connections has drawn attention as they occurred before cryptocurrency markets achieved mainstream adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From 19 June 2026, the Data Use and Access Act 2025 (DUAA) will introduce a new, statutory "right to complain" for individuals in the UK regarding their data protection rights. This right, set out in the new section 164A of the Data Protection Act 2018 and as inserted by DUAA, requires individuals to lodge a complaint directly with an organisation first before they can escalate it to the ICO. The ICO has published guidance setting out how organisations should handle data protection complaints which we have summarised below. If an organisation is unsure whether someone is making a data protection complaint then they should ask for clarification. As with other data subject rights requests, complaints can be made via any channel and individuals do not need to use legal terms or quote applicable legislation to make them. Individuals need to be given a mechanism through which to make their complaint, for example, via email, phone or a complaints portal. Existing data subject rights or complaints processes can be adapted for organisations to meet their obligations. Although not required, providing a written complaints procedure can make it easier for individuals to understand how to raise a complaint, which in turn helps make an organisation in meeting these obligations. Organisations should ensure that staff can recognise a data protection complaint and know how to handle it appropriately. This includes understanding where complaints should be directed and ensuring that handling of data protection complaints forms part of internal data protection training. Organisations must have a process for handling data protection complaints which includes: Organisations must keep individuals updated on the progress of their investigation without undue delay. For example, if an investigation is likely to take a long time, the organisation needs to follow up on the initial acknowledgment to make the individual aware of this. If complainants are unhappy with the outcome, organisations could consider clarifying their decision and, as best practice, provide details about how to complain to the ICO. What should organisations do after the response has been shared? Finally, organisations should consider reviewing lessons learned to prevent future, similar data protection issues. If you have any questions or would like assistance with updating privacy notices, drafting complaints procedures and/or internal complaints policies, please reach out to a member of our team who will be happy to assist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite intermittent rallies, broader momentum has remained weak, reflecting reduced speculative appetite, tighter liquidity conditions, and a gradual shift in investor preference toward more established crypto assets. This prolonged underperformance has left a large portion of the altcoin sector trading well below historical peaks, reinforcing cautious sentiment across the market. A recent CryptoQuant analysis provides additional context by examining capital rotation patterns during Bitcoin's latest corrective phase. After a sharp pullback, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation range roughly between $65,000 and $72,000, an area where significant activity from whales, long-term holders, and institutional participants appears to be concentrated. Such consolidation zones often attract strategic accumulation rather than speculative altcoin exposure. Historically, deep corrections or late-stage bear phases tend to trigger capital migration toward Bitcoin, while altcoins experience reduced inflows. Binance trading volume data — segmented into BTC, ETH, and other altcoins — highlights this dynamic clearly. This leadership has persisted since then, suggesting sustained investor preference for the relative stability and liquidity associated with Bitcoin during uncertain conditions. In comparison, altcoins represented about 35.3% of total trading volume, while Ethereum accounted for approximately 27.8%. Although these figures still reflect meaningful participation, altcoins have experienced the sharpest contraction in activity. Back in November, altcoins represented around 59.2% of Binance trading volumes, but by February 13 their share had dropped to roughly 33.6%, marking close to a 50% decline in market participation. Periods of heightened uncertainty typically drive capital toward Bitcoin, which continues to function as the sector's primary liquidity anchor. This recurring rotation highlights Bitcoin's role as a perceived safer crypto asset when volatility rises and speculative appetite diminishes. Altcoin Market Cap Weakens As Risk Appetite Remains Limited This zone has acted as a tentative support area, but the lack of a strong rebound suggests that risk appetite remains subdued across smaller-cap assets. Previous recovery attempts have repeatedly stalled near dynamic resistance, reinforcing the idea that capital rotation toward major assets — particularly Bitcoin — continues to dominate market behavior. Elevated volatility during the most recent declines also points to fragile liquidity conditions. Spikes in selling activity accompanied the latest pullback, suggesting distribution rather than accumulation. Historically, similar configurations have often preceded prolonged consolidation phases rather than immediate recoveries. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This designation refers to the three pillars of the new policy: Real-world assets (RWA), All virtual currencies, and Wallet-based digital yuan. By explicitly including RWA tokenization within the core of national regulation, China has signaled a transition from a reactive “campaign-style” clearing of crypto activities toward a proactive era of institutional construction. This move aims to harness the efficiency of blockchain technology for asset securitization and cross-border trade while maintaining an absolute monopoly on monetary sovereignty through the upgraded digital yuan (e-CNY) ecosystem. Under this new structure, digital yuan balances held in commercial bank wallets are now classified as bank deposit liabilities, protected by the national deposit insurance system and included in the required reserve framework. By late 2025, the digital yuan had already processed over 16.7 trillion yuan in transaction volume, and the new framework is designed to scale this infrastructure further into public services, education, and healthcare. This “resilience-first” approach allows China to provide the benefits of programmable, smart-contract-based transactions without the financial disintermediation risks associated with decentralized stablecoins or private cryptocurrencies. The RAW framework also clarifies China's strategy for the tokenization of real-world assets, such as infrastructure concessions, commodities, and real estate income rights. Domestic RWA activities remain strictly prohibited unless conducted through specific, authority-approved financial market infrastructure, effectively making Hong Kong the primary “operational interface” for this sector. These activities are subject to rigorous filings, data governance, and foreign-exchange controls to prevent “technological black channels” from circumventing capital restrictions. By positioning Hong Kong as the bridge between Chinese assets and global liquidity, the RAW framework seeks to reduce reliance on traditional correspondent banking chains and improve the speed of international settlement. As the first batch of licensed stablecoin issuers prepares to launch in Hong Kong in March 2026, the RAW initiative serves as a definitive blueprint for a hybrid digital economy where centralized oversight and blockchain-based efficiency coexist within a tightly controlled, state-led ecosystem.</p>
