The new trailer for “Toy Story 5” has dropped, and it returns Woody (from retirement? to his old friends and to help out Jessie's owner Bonnie from yet another new threat taking kids away from their beloved toys: a tablet. The new trailer shows Woody Eastwood teaming up with Buzz and the gang to curb the influence of Lilypad, an interactive, talking green teaching tablet shaped like a frog that has Bonnie obsessed with screen time. Franchise newbie Greta Lee voices Lilypad, and we get a taste of her character in a scene in which Jessie confronts her and asks if she's even listening, to which Lilypad replies, “I'm always listening” and then repeats Jessie's words in both English and Spanish. Lilypad soon conspires to send the toys away and have “tech” take over playtime from the toys.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. When cinematographer Linus Sandgren reunited with “Saltburn” director Emerald Fennell for her maximalist take on Emily Brontë's 1847 classic “Wuthering Heights,” he immediately felt liberated by Fennell's passionate, fearless approach to the material. “But in this case, the realism is Emerald's world — it was very inspiring because it felt like there were no limits to how expressive we could be with this love story. You really could go all the way, having free rein.” Having free rein meant Sandgren was able to help Fennell find a cinematic corollary for the visceral experience she had as a teenager when she first read the book. “ I wanted to make something that felt like the world of a 14-year-old girl reading this book for the first time,” Fennell told IndieWire, “which meant that things are a little more heightened, or a little more anachronistic.” The key for Fennell, Sandgren, and collaborators like production designer Suzie Davies, was to create a self-contained world with its own internal logic and guiding principles — principles informed not by literal reality but by the emotional states of the characters. “In Yorkshire, where the story takes place, you have dramatic weather to work with,” Sandgren said. “It's a great metaphor.” For example, when the filmmakers wanted to convey the humiliation of heroine Cathy's father (Martin Clunes), they relied heavily on rain to give him the appearance of, as Sandgren put it, “a sad dog.” Because even many exteriors were created on stages, Sandgren and Fennell had extreme control over their palette; the result is some of the most striking color imagery since the glory days of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, whose studio-bound flights of fancy like “Black Narcissus” and “A Matter of Life and Death” were key reference points for Fennell. As has come to be Sandgren's usual practice, “Wuthering Heights” was captured on film — primarily 35mm, with some sweeping landscape shots photographed in VistaVision. But film moves, and that automatically helps with the suspension of disbelief. “It could have been a 1.33 movie, and it could have been a 2.40 movie,” Sandgren said, explaining that he and Fennell had a lot of discussions about the pros and cons of various aspect ratios. “Unfortunately, most screens now are built for 1.85, and if you see a 2.40 movie, it has matting just like on your TV. When you go to a cinema, you want to see it as big as possible on the screen, and today 1.85 screens are the larger format.” Fennell noted that the different aspect ratios indicate the different approaches taken to “Saltburn” and “Wuthering Heights.” “‘Saltburn' is a portrait and this is a landscape,” Fennell said, adding that if they had gone wider, it would have been more difficult to compose in the painterly fashion to which she and Sandgren aspired. “The movie is often about her being lonely,” Sandgren said. Ultimately, Sandgren and Fennell agreed that these decisions and others were guided largely by instinct; although they began each day with a shot list, they didn't lock themselves into it or create detailed storyboards that would restrict the actors. “It's a long process where things slowly evolve,” Sandgren said. “Some scenes might be very clearly planned, while others evolve and finalize on the day. “We plan really rigorously,” Fennell said, explaining that careful shot-listing then liberates her and Sandgren to explore in the moment. “We have it already, and then you see something more interesting. And you can really only do that on the day.” “We looked at a lot of disgusting stuff,” Fennell said. That's the real fun… then you get to open all sorts of little doors.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In his first outing behind the camera since Barry, his Emmy-winning dark comedy for HBO, Bill Hader has officially locked in plans to write, direct and star in They Know, a new horror film for MRC, which will begin production in Los Angeles this spring. They Know centers on a divorced dad (Hader) who grows suspicious that his ex-wife is secretly dating a mysterious man who is having a strange influence on their children. With the film, Hader is set to become the latest major comedic talent to make his mark in horror, joining a lineage that includes the likes of Jordan Peele, Zach Cregger, and most recently, Curry Barker. MRC is the studio financing the project, which is based on an original story Hader created with his Barry collaborator Duffy Boudreau. Bob Graf and Hader are set to produce under the latter's Hanarply banner, with Alyssa Donovan co-producing. With his work on Barry, a tragicomedy about a hitman trying to turn over a new leaf as an actor, only for the consequences of his actions to slowly but surely catch up with him, Hader became the rare winner of three DGA Awards, also winning multiple Emmys and Critics Choice Awards. Hader co-created the show with Alec Berg and also served as its co-showrunner, executive producer, director, writer, and star. A longtime cast member on Saturday Night Live, Hader's other acting credits include Trainwreck, Superbad and The Skeleton Twins. Coming off the release of Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights, which has grossed over $92M worldwide in a little over a week, MRC's upcoming slate includes The Only Living Pickpocket in New York and The Gallerist, which just premiered at Sundance, as well as A Place in Hell, The Best Is Yet to Come, Unabomer, and Eloise. Hader is repped by UTA and Felker Toczek Suddleson. Nominated for three Emmys, with additional credits including The Lowdown, Hit-Monkey, Documentary Now!, and Big Mouth, Boudreau is repped by UTA and TroyGould.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Veterans Affairs this week issued a public notice announcing some changes in how it evaluates disability ratings. The new rules, which went into effect on an interim basis on Tuesday, open the door for the VA to slash earned disability ratings from veterans in two major ways, breaking from years of established U.S. law on workers' compensation. First, the VA can now take medication into account when rating a disability. For example, tinnitus, or ear ringing, is one of the most common conditions for which the VA assigns a disability rating. Under the new rule, if the VA says aspirin or painkillers reduce your tinnitus, they can lower your rating or refuse to rate it at all. If the VA determines that a veteran is employed, it can deny disability or pension payments entirely. VA disability ratings are a government acknowledgement that military service led to a permanent condition that affects quality of life and long-term earning capacity. One veteran could be rated 100 percent permanently disabled, for example, while another can be rated at 10 or 20 percent for minor injuries or ailments. It is indemnity for harm incurred in service. This was codified in U.S. law by Ingram v. Collins, a 2025 case brought against VA Secretary Doug Collins in which the court ultimately ruled that when a VA disability rating rule does not explicitly mention medication, the VA must evaluate the veteran's condition as it is, without the assistance of medication. The decision was designed to protect veterans from losing benefits regardless of whether they followed medical advice. Tinnitus, PTSD, asthma, and chronic pain were evaluated on medical impairment and functional impact in daily life, while separate programs handled inability to work. “This regulation simply formalizes VA's longstanding practice of determining disability ratings based on Veterans' service-related disabilities and any medications they are taking to treat those disabilities,” VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “For years, courts held that VA could not reduce ratings based on the effects of medication, requiring evaluation of a veteran's true functional impairment when evaluating a service-connected disability,” Veterans of Foreign Wars said in a statement. “This new rule reverses that standard, directing examiners to rate disabilities as they present, including the impact of medication, and to disregard unmedicated baseline severity.” The VA Was a Safe Space for Veterans. VFW National Commander Carol Whitmore added that while “VA has authority to amend the rating schedule, it must do so without adversely affecting veterans.” Coleman Lee, national commander of veterans group DAV, wrote in a statement that the group is “extremely disappointed and alarmed by VA's decision to issue an Interim Final Rule today that could potentially reduce disability compensation for millions of disabled veterans” and that the “new regulation would allow VA to reduce disability compensation ratings for veterans who take medications to control their conditions or reduce their symptoms.” The VA rewriting the rules on disability ratings, like many of the department's actions since Trump retook office, is in line with Project 2025, which called for a number of measures that would negatively impact health care and other benefits for veterans. “Efforts to expand disability benefits to large populations without adequate planning have caused an erosion of veterans' trust in the VA enterprise,” Brooks T. Tucker wrote in the notorious right-wing policy manifesto. ‘Pulp Fiction' Actor Peter Greene's Cause of Death Revealed After Being Found Dead in Apartment Crew Members Say Shia LaBeouf Was ‘Completely Wild' on Set of Recent Film Shoot Who Will Be Next to Headline the Sphere? As Trump calls for a historic $1.5 trillion military budget for 2027 (which Congress supports) while racking up a multi-trillion-dollar budget deficit, it seems once again that veterans will be the ones paying the price so billionaires and trillionaires can get their tax breaks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States simply isn't big enough for two bosses. That's one takeaway from a new missive from the White House, which has dismissed Bruce Springsteen as a “loser” with “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and an atrophying brain, doing so by way of a statement. Only this time, the titles of several choice Springsteen work are woven in for added effect. “When this loser Springsteen comes back home to his own City of Ruins in his head, he'll realize his Glory Days are behind him and his fans have left him Out in the Street, putting him in a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out because he has a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his brain,” reads the message from White House comms director Steven Cheung, issued to Politico. Billboard has reached out to Springsteen for comment. 1 with “Streets of Minneapolis,” which debuted atop Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart dated Feb. 7. Springsteen is many things, but a “loser” — as the administration has referred to him — isn't one of them. Across a 40 year-plus career, the rocker has collected 20 Grammys, won an Oscar and a Tony, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, received a Kennedy Center Honor and, in November 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And his album sales are north of 150 million, reps say. After 129 shows, the Springsteen and E Street Band 2023-25 tour grossed $729.7 million and sold 4.9 million tickets, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, for the biggest result of his career. “We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair — the cavalry is coming!” said Springsteen in a statement Tuesday (Feb. 17) when announcing the forthcoming tour. He added, “We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America — American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution and our sacred American dream — all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, D.C. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome — so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock n' Rebellion!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In early February, Noah Kahan announced an impressive North American stadium tour in support of his upcoming fourth album, The Great Divide – and it's already sold out. Equally impressive: the measures Kahan and his team have taken to ensure that tickets ended up in the hands of fans – and for face value. “Selling out his first stadium run this quickly speaks to the deep connection he's built with fans through both his music and his live show,” says Michael Yerke, a global tour promoter at Live Nation, which is promoting Kahan's tour. “He is always intentional about the fan experience, making thoughtful decisions to ensure fans can access and enjoy his shows.” For the Great Divide outing, Kahan made use of two Ticketmaster programs that aim to improve the fan experience when it comes to purchasing concert tickets. Additionally, Kahan is using Ticketmaster's Face Value Exchange program, which caps resale prices at the original price paid with no added fees. Since becoming available in 2019, artists including Hayley Williams, Billie Eilish and Foo Fighters have used the program. “Noah's priority has always been the fans,” says manager Drew Simmons, a partner at Foundations. “I'm proud to work with an artist that is willing to take risks and lead the way by implementing these new security measures, a first at stadium scale.” Simmons adds that “beyond fighting bots and brokers,” the team prioritized keeping ticket prices reasonable, with floor seats starting at $150, including fees. “Noah's relationship with fans is meaningful and the demand for tickets has been exceptional,” says Simmons. Not only is Kahan making his shows more affordable and accessible to fans, but he is continuing his work – on and off the road – as a mental health advocate through The Busyhead project, which he launched in 2023. Busyhead has raised over $5.5 million to date, and with The Great Divide Tour, will earn another $2 million thanks to Ticketmaster and Tickets For Good's Make a Difference initiative, which helps teachers, healthcare workers and non-profit staff receive free or significantly discounted tickets. Kahan's sold-out stadium run – which includes an unprecedented four nights at Fenway Park – sold over one million tickets. 2 on the Billboard 200 and its title track earned Kahan his first Hot 100 top 10. He bested that placement with The Great Divide's lead single and title track, which debuted at No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Angela Sant'Albano has been revealed as the voice and motion-capture performer for the new leading character Grace Ashcroft in Capcom's upcoming video game Resident Evil: Requiem. The game was revealed in a surprise announcement during Los Angeles' Summer Game Fest in June, commemorating 30 years of the Resident Evil franchise. It will be released February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch 2. Requiem, the ninth installment in the video game series, takes place about 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City and centers on FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak protagonist Alyssa Ashcroft, who is still haunted by the mysterious death of her mother some eight years earlier. When she is thrown into an investigation of murders connected to her mother's past in Raccoon City, she catches the eye of former Umbrella scientist Dr. Victor Gideon, who claims Grace holds the key to unlocking a secret project. Somewhere along the way in Grace's investigation, she crosses paths with anti-bioterrorism agent and longtime series mainstay Leon Kennedy, who holds dark secrets of his own. Capcom also has confirmed the return of Nick Apostolides, who took over the voice of Leon Kennedy in the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4 remakes and Netflix's series Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness. Since Resident Evil's video game debut in 1996, the series continues to be among Capcom's most popular and highest-grossing titles. The recent release of Resident Evil 4 remake (2023) sold more than 10 million units. Weapons director Zach Cregger is currently working on a Resident Evil film reboot. She made her feature film debut alongside Nicole Kidman, Laura Linney and Colin Firth in 2016's Genius, directed by Michael Grandage. She is repped by Independent Talent Group and Aaron Bergman from Iconoclast. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British royal, formerly known as Prince Andrew before being stripped of his titles by his brother King Charles, is being detained by Thames Valley Police. The police did not name Mountbatten-Windsor, in accordance with U.K. law, but confirmed they arrested a man in his sixties (the royal turned 66 today). The police also confirmed they are searching “addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.” “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement (via the BBC). “It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offense. The news comes after photos began to circulate of police vehicles at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, where Mountbatten-Windsor currently lives. Earlier this month, the British monarch forced his brother to vacate his longtime home at Royal Lodge near Windsor Castle. King Charles III released a statement on the arrest of his brother. “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” he wrote. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. One of the mentions of Mountbatten-Windsor is a photograph of him with a woman who appears to be Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager. Giuffre was one of Epstein's most prominent accusers and also filed a high-profile sexual-assault lawsuit against Andrew, which was settled in 2022. Her family released a statement following Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. “At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” her siblings said in a statement distributed to news outlets. “On behalf of our sister, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, we extend our gratitude to the U.K.'s Thames Valley Police for their investigation, and the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. ‘Pulp Fiction' Actor Peter Greene's Cause of Death Revealed After Being Found Dead in Apartment Crew Members Say Shia LaBeouf Was ‘Completely Wild' on Set of Recent Film Shoot Prince William and Princess Catherine recently shared a rare public statement distancing themselves from Mountbatten-Windsor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some disturbing online searches related to Nancy Guthrie and her daughter, Savannah Guthrie, were made before her disappearance, online data shows. According to Fox News Digital, Google Trends reports appear to show queries for Nancy's home and Savannah's salary as the “Today” show co-host. The outlet reported that someone in Arizona searched for Nancy's Tucson address between June 21 and 28, 2025, and again on January 11, 2026. Separate Google image searches for Nancy Guthrie's residential address were also conducted between March 1 and 8, 2025, as well as on November 30 and December 1, 2025, according to Fox News Digital. In comparison, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Fox News' Sean Hannity also generated similar searches. Someone also appeared to search “Sean Hannity salary” between May 3 and 10, 2025. Meanwhile, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos remains optimistic as the search for Nancy Guthrie continues. “Because let's face it, you've been around enough to know that when these tips dry up, this case goes cold,” Nanos told KGUN. “We believe somebody out there knows who did this. The Sheriff's Department has reportedly taken in nearly 18,000 tips and still counting. On Wednesday, Nanos said he believes Nancy is still in the area. “I think she's somewhere here in our community,” Nanos told BBC. Detectives reportedly scoured border patrol cameras and other electronic devices, but there was still no sign of Nancy. Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her home on February 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Sony has come out on top of a bidding war for Skeletons, a thriller that has JJ Abrams on board to produce and Brie Larson attached to star. He co-wrote the script and is attached to direct. Mollner has emerged as rising filmmaking talent in the mold of a Zech Cregger (Weapons) and Parker Finn (Smile), an original voice in the genre space. He wrote last year's acclaimed adaptation of Stephen King's The Long Walk, but did not direct it. Many of Skeletons plot details are being kept in the closet. It is understood, however, to focus on the relationship between a son and his mother, with the latter being mysteriously placed in a secure cage each night. The initial draft was written by Brian Duffield, who wrote No One Will Save You (which he also directed) and Love and Monsters. The project is based on a short story by Philip Fracassi and at one point was previously known as Fail-Safe. Sony, however, came in aggressively to take worldwide rights. It was not immediately clear where financial figures are landing, but it is at least in the mid-$20 million range for domestic rights. Abrams has been relatively quiet on the feature front since making 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, focusing much of his attention on television. Larson's last big-screen entry was Marvel Studios' ill-fated The Marvels and she also starred in Apple TV's prestige mini-series Lessons in Chemistry. Worldwide acquisitions president Joe Matukewicz,  exec VP of business affairs Virginia Longmuir, and VP of business development Elan Kovo are negotiating the deal for Sony.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As we've reported pretty extensively lately, there's been a lot of back-and-forth going on this week over Stephen Colbert's interview with Texas Rep. James Talarico—and, specifically, who told who what about whether running said interview with the prospective Senate hopeful would run afoul of the FCC's famed equal-time rules for political candidates. “I think yesterday was a perfect encapsulation of why the American people have more trust in gas station sushi than they do in the national news media,” Carr feverishly Dennis Miller-ed during an FCC meeting on Wednesday, per The Guardian—suggesting the news media should be ashamed for believing Colbert's “lies” about the interview. Said accusations stemming, as far as we can tell, from Colbert (and Talarico, who's gotten a pretty major media bump off of all this) refusing to pay lip service to Carr's policy of running the government's TV regulation by a national expression of the “I'm not touching you, I'm not actually touching you!” rule so favored by childhood's most irritating siblings. After all, Carr never publicly told CBS not to air an interview with the Democratic up-and-comer: He just made very loud noises about how his FCC wouldn't be adhering to decades of precedent about talk show interviews being treated as exempt from the equal-time rule anymore, and (quite successfully, it appears) waited for the network to comply in advance and regulate itself. This “I never technically regulated you” approach might offer Carr some measure of legal cover, but it's offered no such protection from Colbert, who has blasted both the FCC and his network over the “legal guidance” they've been so kindly offering him of late. Which, again, has led to the woeful image of Carr trying to throw shade at a guy who cut his national comedy teeth eviscerating hypocrites for a living, tepidly firing back (per Reuters) that Colbert has “what he probably views as a long and distinguished career in the limelight, sees that that limelight is fading, is coming to an end. That's got to be a difficult time for him… That doesn't change the facts of what happened here.” Speaking of facts: After all that, Carr then went on to state that he was pursuing an “enforcement action” against ABC's The View for having Talarico on two weeks ago, all but confirming that he would have done the same thing to CBS had they aired the interview. Ignoring the fact that equal-time complaints are traditionally supposed to come from the rival candidates in a campaign, and not just bubbled up by the FCC itself, the move ably demonstrates the true point of so much of Carr's policy in recent years: To produce a chilling effect so that networks don't even bother running the risk of getting dinged, allowing Carr to claim, with a straight smirk, that he's not the one censoring anybody at all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka may look like a couple goals today. But even their long-standing marriage has had its share of turbulence, including a period that forced Bateman to confront habits that were quietly straining their relationship. In a new interview, Bateman is getting candid and opening up like never before! The star is revisiting a chapter of his life that forced him to slow down and look inward. He shared that getting sober was less about career ambition and more about easing the quiet strain his drinking had placed on his relationship with Amanda Anka. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Wednesday, the “Horrible Bosses” star reflected on how his years of partying brought, as Anka described, a constant “drip, drip, drip” of unpredictability into their home. Anka, also 57, eventually asked him when the “spigot was going to completely turn off.” Bateman admitted they had “a few negotiations” about his drinking. “I was like, ‘Well, I feel like my [sobriety] ETA is six months away, but if I could land this plane now, it would alleviate a lot of the tension, so let's just [expletive] do it,'” the “SmartLess” podcast co-host said. Looking back, he said it was not a dramatic breaking point. Bateman said he has stayed away from alcohol and cocaine, which he once described as “the ‘Scarface' stuff,” since getting sober. At the time, he was thinking beyond Hollywood success. Bateman married Anka in July 2001, the same year he stopped drinking. The couple later welcomed daughters Francesca, now 19, and Maple, now 14, milestones that unfolded in the years that followed his decision to change course. In a December 2025 interview with Esquire, Bateman reflected on how quickly his life transformed. Looking back, he described the years leading up to that shift as a “confusing and challenging … learning curve,” especially after spending much of his childhood steadily working in Hollywood. Bateman has long acknowledged that alcohol often fueled other habits in his 20s. In a 2009 interview with Details, via NBC Miami, he explained, “Booze was what would make me want to stay out all night and do some blow or smoke a joint or whatever, so shutting that off was key. Do you want to continue being great at being in your twenties, or do you want to step up and graduate into adulthood?” Today, Bateman's career remains strong, and his marriage to Anka is thriving!
