            Terence Stamp, the British actor who became synonymous with Swinging London in the 1960s, has died, his family said Sunday, according to Reuters. He was 87 years old.
    


            Stamp first came to prominence when he took on the titular role in the 1962 film “Billy Budd.” The black and white drama, directed by Peter Ustinov, who also starred, saw Stamp nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor - the only Oscar nomination of his lengthy career.
    


            He went on to star in a host of films in the 1960s, among them John Schlesinger's Thomas Hardy adaptation “Far From the Madding Crowd” and Ken Loach's first feature film, “Poor Cow.”
    


            CNN has reached out to his representatives for confirmation of his death.
    


            He was a star who rose from humble beginnings in London's East End, about as far from Hollywood as you can get. He was born on July 22, 1938, to parents Ethel and Thomas, a merchant seaman.
    


            In a 2013 interview with the British Film Institute (BFI), Stamp revealed that his father tried to deter him from a career in showbiz.
    


            “He genuinely believed that people like us didn't do things like that,” he said. But his mother, he said, “loved every second of it.”
    


            “In retrospect, my mother must have always wanted me to do it and must have wished that she could have been more supportive. But my dad was the head of the family and I never really knew what he thought of it because he was of that generation.
    


            “He was a merchant seaman, he shovelled coal, and in that confined living quarters any show of emotion would have been considered unbearably flash.”
    


            Stamp would become one of the biggest figures of 1960s London, romantically linked to model Jean Shrimpton and actresses Julie Christie - his “Far From the Madding Crowd” co-star - and Brigitte Bardot.
    


            His only marriage came in 2002 - to an Australian pharmacist 35 years his junior - but that lasted just six years, according to the Guardian.
    


            Stamp famously roomed with fellow actor Michael Caine, who was also a rising star at the time. The pair lost touch, however, as he disclosed in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2015.
    


            “We just went different ways. I can understand it: in many ways he was much more mature than me,” he said of Caine, who was five years older.
    


            “Caine gave me all my early values, like making sure you were doing good stuff, waiting for the right things – then as soon as he got away he did exactly the opposite. Went from one movie to another.”
    


            After a few years away from the screen, Stamp appeared in the 1978 blockbuster “Superman” as the superhero's adversary, General Zod. He reprised the role of the comic book villain in the sequel two years later.
    


            Ironically, more than two decades later Stamp went on to voice the role of Superman's father Jor-El in the TV series “Smallville.”
    


            His many screen credits also included his role as drag queen Bernadette in the 1990s Australian comedy “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.”
    


            Of his eclectic career - including roles in Hollywood's “Wall Street” and “The Adjustment Bureau” - he told the Guardian that he had no ambitions, adding: “I've had bad experiences and things that didn't work out; my love for film sometimes diminishes but then it just resurrects itself.
    


            “I never have to gee myself up, or demand a huge wage to get out of bed in the morning. I've done crap, because sometimes I didn't have the rent. But when I've got the rent, I want to do the best I can.”

            Gavin Newsom knows the popular image of him is of a smooth talker with slicked-back hair, the wealthy liberal who co-owns a vineyard.
    


            He knows, regarding the presidential ambitions he's hardly hiding, that the biggest question he would face out of the gate is whether he could sell Americans on wanting California to represent their future rather than seeing it as the place where the wackiest liberal dreams go to run wild.
    


            The redistricting fight that Newsom and the state legislature are launching Monday could, he and his inner circle believe, give him all the rebuttals he needs.
    


            If it succeeds.
    


            Newsom is already raising money and preparing for an onslaught of Republican cash aimed at defeating the November ballot initiative California legislators expect to enact as quickly as Thursday, asking voters to allow a gerrymander of five new Democratic seats in the US House. He has started making plans for what he assumes will be President Donald Trump's retaliation against him for trying to erase Republican gains in Texas.
    


            He recently spent an hour on the phone trying to smooth over former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who created California's independent redistricting commission and has made fighting gerrymandering one of his post-politics priorities. (It may not have helped: Schwarzenegger posted a deliberately cryptic photo Friday of himself lifting weights in a T-shirt reading: “F*** The Politicians: Terminate Gerrymandering.”)
    


            Democrats often talk about fighting Trump more. Newsom now has yet another actual fight to have.
    


            Newsom told CNN that he feels “blessed” to have the chance and that he's worried Democrats are undermining voters' faith with inspiring but ultimately empty promises.
    


            “It's faith and works,” he said in an interview hours after he formally launched his redistricting push with a vow to fight “fire with fire.” “You go to church. It's, as you pray, move your feet. It's passion and action.”
    


            “I don't want to go to another candlelight vigil. I don't want to hold hands. People need to do something. ‘Do something!' I hear it. ‘Do something.' People are done with us. If I give another speech and I don't follow up with something, I'm done. And (Trump's Republicans) are going to roll us over,” Newsom said.
    


            Aides to several of Newsom's potential presidential primary rivals told CNN they weren't going to address directly what the governor is doing. But all the people already thinking about the bigger political picture for Democrats know what this showdown could mean for him.
    


            “What do you mean he can't win a general election?” one of Newsom's strategists told CNN, asking the question they know he'll confront and speaking anonymously to discuss the internal thinking about how this would reverberate. “He just helped us take back the House. If this wins, and the Democrats win, he's a winner: a leader of the opposition, and an effective leader.”
    


            Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco-based former House speaker who has long been a Newsom booster and is already helping him fundraise for the ballot initiative campaign, said that after Trump started the unusual mid-decade redistricting push, “you throw a punch, you better be ready to take punch — for the children, as I always say, and for our democracy.”
    


            “When this came along, it provided a vehicle like none other,” Pelosi said. “And people who had been saying, ‘Give me something to do, what can I do?' or, ‘Why aren't we doing more?' are now really very excited about the leadership that is being provided by California under the leadership of Gavin.”
    


            Just a few months ago, after calling a post-election special session of the legislature to pass several “Trump-proofing” laws, Newsom began to reach out to the president.
    


            First came the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Newsom, exhausted and frantic by the scale of the destruction and what rebuilding would entail, spent days in a command center managing the response but also apoplectic about the misinformation he saw spreading on social media, often from the Trump directly and with signal-boosting from Elon Musk. Still, he showed up at the airport to greet the newly inaugurated president and kissed the first lady on the cheek, then spent 90 minutes in the Oval Office, pleading for disaster aid.
    


            Then was what came off to many allies and rivals as a journey of self-exploration via podcasting. He seemed to switch his position on transgender rights to better match the Democratic backlash that set in after those questions helped take down his old rival Kamala Harris. He invited on MAGA celebrities Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, saying he was looking for common ground.
    


            Many Democrats felt betrayed. Others dismissed Newsom as being purely opportunistic. Even people who worked for him said that he seemed adrift, following his own sense of what he wanted to do, and he needed to decide whether he wanted his future to be on the iTunes charts or in the White House.
    


            Weeks before standing up to the president's June immigration enforcement crackdown in Los Angeles, Newsom introduced massive social services cuts for the state budget, which he said were the only way to deal with the coming shortfalls under Trump. At the time, Lorena Gonzalez, a Democratic former member of the State Assembly and now powerful California Labor Federation president, told CNN that Newsom was behaving like “a San Diego Republican of the 2000s or 2010s.”
    


            Responding to Trump that way, Gonzalez told CNN in June, “is a choice. It's not a choice I would make.”
    


            Gonzalez was one of the speakers at Thursday's redistricting kickoff in Los Angeles, introducing Newsom in lionizing terms, while Sen. Alex Padilla called him “the person who has brought us together for this fight of all fights.” A few minutes later US Rep. Maxine Waters said he was showing “the kind of leadership that's going to determine the future of this country.”
    


            And underscoring both the Trump administration's crackdown in California and Newsom's feeling that retaliation is coming, Border Patrol agents arrived outside the rally to detain people with cameras rolling.
    


            For those who wanted more pushback right away in Trump's second presidency, Newsom is ringing a little hollow now.
    


            “I'm very glad that Gavin Newsom has abandoned the ‘sit down with our mortal enemies for podcasts' phase of his political career,” said one top Democratic strategist starting to think through the 2028 race, asking for anonymity to not speak directly toward a candidate's calculations. “But his turnabout here speaks to the fundamental problem he has with the Democratic electorate: He says and does what he thinks is right for him in the moment as opposed to what is right for the country.”
    


            Newsom's response: “Give me a goddamn break. What a bulls*** comment.”
    


            He was riled up, calling himself “the guy who's done more progressive policy than anybody,” ticking through his record on expanding health care, raising the minimum wage, building housing, and enacting a wide range of larger social, racial and economic justice initiatives.
    


            “They can't be serious, because they're not serious, because they don't know what the hell they're talking about,” Newsom said, saying he's still the same man who as San Francisco mayor first made headlines 20 years ago for officiating the first legal gay marriages in the country.
    


            “I've been hiding in plain sight. It's, like, really? You've now discovered something that's been there the whole time,” Newsom said. “I think it's maybe a secret power because, you know, get ready.”
    


            Many Democratic governors who tangled with Trump through the pandemic walked away chastened, believing they could never work with him again. Newsom said he got everything he asked for even after the last intense wildfires. He said he started out wanting to believe that he could work with Trump again until that meeting in the Oval Office in February, when it quickly hit him that the president is “a different person.”
    


            Trump, Newsom said, kept talking about himself, pointing to a picture of Franklin Roosevelt and talking about running for a third term like Roosevelt did before the US Constitution was amended with a two-term limit.
    


            “It was maniacal,” Newsom said. “You felt those authoritarian tendencies coming in a way that even — when I say even, in quotes — even in the first term, were not as present.”
    


            As for hosting Kirk or Bannon on his podcast, Newsom said it's ridiculous to argue he was doing anything to platform people who already have huge followings.
    


            “Just because you turn your back, they're going to disappear? How naïve is that? How stupid? Give me a break,” Newsom said. “We need to understand what makes them tick, what motivates them.”
    


            Plus, Newsom said, there are areas of agreement, like when he felt Bannon seemed in favor of California's tax system. Maybe there's some opportunity for Democrats there, too.
    


            Newsom's podcast, for all the snickering it caused, is at breakthrough levels of listeners. His email list is generally considered the second-best in Democratic politics, only after Harris' from the presidential campaign.
    


            His press office's social media account has become a multi-aide operation itself and shifted to a Trump-aping full-time troll, complete with schoolyard nicknames and “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!” sign-offs.
    


            Asked last week by a reporter to defend the tone he's adopted online, Newsom said, “If you have issues with what I'm putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns with what he's putting out as president,” decrying what he said was the “normalization” of that approach even as he noted he was “pleased with the attention.”
    


            Newsom is fundraising. He will campaign hard through November. He will hope that a combination of Democratic turnout, a pitch about giving voters the voice in redistricting, and the reaffirmation of the independent redistricting commission for future cycles will get him to victory.
    


            The next fight is already on his mind, as he says he will make sure the University of California, Los Angeles, does not agree to a settlement with the Trump administration – “we'll never settle out, like Harvard appears to be selling out,” he said.
    


            But Newsom said he already knows what he will say if he loses this one.
    


            “I'll tell people: I put it all on the line. Did what I thought was right. And you know what? I value your opinion. I value your point of view. And I pray for all of us,” Newsom said. “Because, you know, God help us if we're not successful. And I mean it. You may have enjoyed one of your last free and fair elections. And it will be a free and a fair election, despite these guys showing up in masks.”

            Large crowds of Israelis took to the streets on Sunday, launching a nationwide grassroots strike and widespread protests to demand the government secure the release of 50 hostages still in Gaza.
    


            In one of the largest coordinated demonstrations since the beginning of the Gaza war nearly two years ago, protesters blocked major roads, closed private businesses, and staged rallies in big cities.
    


            People also protested outside government minister's homes. Organizers estimated that hundreds of thousands took part in the strike across Israel.
    


            The day of protests began at 06:29am, the exact time when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel on October 7.
    


            Family members of the hostages, leading the strike alongside the October Council, which represents bereaved families from the war, held a press conference in Tel Aviv, announcing an “emergency break” until the hostages are released.
    


            “Today, we stop everything to save the lives of 50 hostages and soldiers. Today, we stop everything to remember the supreme value of the sanctity of life,” said Anat Engrest, whose son Matan, is held hostage in Gaza.
    


            Polls have repeatedly shown a large majority in Israel support a ceasefire deal to release all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war. The last round of negotiations fell apart in late-July, when the US and Israel withdrew their teams from talks in Doha, accusing Hamas of not negotiating in good faith.
    


            “We are united in one simple demand directed at the Israeli government: Put an Israeli proposal on the table today for a comprehensive deal - to end the war in exchange for the return of the last hostage. No slogans, no sabotage, no demands that we know the other side won't accept,” said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod, is a hostage. “It's time to end the horrific nightmare the entire country has been living in for 22 months.”
    


            The strike was announced last week, following the Israeli security cabinet's decision to expand the war and take over Gaza City, despite the Israeli military's warning that the operations could endanger the 50 remaining hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.
    


            The Israeli military says the operation will begin “soon” and the government says it will provide the local population with tents before relocating them “for their protection.” Almost the entire population in Gaza has been displaced, with many forced to move multiple times.
    


            As of early Sunday afternoon, Israeli police say 38 protesters had been arrested across the country for disturbing the peace.
    


            Israel's largest labor organization, the Histadrut, did not join the strike, though it encouraged employers to let workers participate. But many technology companies, law firms, academic institutions and private sector enterprises announced their participation and support, alongside citizens who declared they would take the day off or refrain from business transactions.
    


            Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed support for the hostage families, while visiting the central gathering at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. “All of the people of Israel are anxious, concerned, and want the hostages to come home. There is not a single Israeli woman or man who does not want them home,” Herzog said.
    


            But members of the Israeli government slammed the day of protests.
    


            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting: “Those who are calling today to end the war without defeating Hamas not only harden Hamas's stance and delay the release of our hostages – they are also ensuring that the horrors of October 7 will repeat themselves again and again.”
    


            Itamar Ben Gvir, the far-right Minister of National Security, said the strike was a “cynical political maneuver on the backs of the hostages,” linking it to long-standing anti-government protest movement.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most of the hostages who remain in Gaza, said in response: “You can continue to hide behind spins and political calculations, but you cannot escape responsibility.”
    


            The Forum announced plans to set up a protest encampment on the Gaza border called “Waypoint 50” – representing the 50 hostages – to continue pressuring the government to secure their release.

BERLIN, August 17. /TASS/. The governments of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer plan to decide on August 17 whether their leaders would be travelling to the United States for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, Germany's Bild daily reported.

According to Bild, the governments of Merz, Starmer and Macron intend on Sunday, August 17, to coordinate their actions and jointly decide whether who would exactly be travelling to the United States on August 18 fro Trump's meeting with Zelensky. However, such a decision requires an official invitation on behalf of the United States, according to Bild.

The daily reported that US President Trump offered Zelensky to invite European politicians to the United States, however, there were no official invitations extended as of yet. Bild added that European leaders seek to avoid a meeting intended solely for publicity.

AFP reported earlier citing the Elysee Palace that the `coalition of the willing' will convene a meeting via video link on August 17.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and French President Emmanuel Macron, who earlier announced that the members of the coalition will hold a conversation soon without disclosing the date, will get together for an online conversation at 3:00 p.m. local time (1:00 p.m. GMT) on Sunday. The three leaders will discuss ""next steps as part of the discussion on peace in Ukraine.""

The New York Times reported earlier, citing sources, that following his meeting with Putin, the US leader proposed negotiating a peace deal under which Ukraine would give up the rest of the Donbass region to Russia, including areas not liberated by Russian troops, in a phone call with European leaders. A ceasefire in the rest of Ukraine at present-day battlefronts and security guarantees, both for Kiev and Europe, would be offered in return.

On August 15, Putin and Trump met at the Elmendorf-Richardson military base in Alaska. Their talks lasted approximately three hours, including a one-on-one conversation in the American leader's limousine en route to the main negotiation venue, as well as a subsequent small-group discussion involving three participants on either side.

The Russian delegation included Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the American side was represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff. In a statement to the media following the talks, Putin said they mostly focused on resolving the Ukraine conflict.

Trump described his summit with Putin as ""very productive."" Later, he called Vladimir Zelensky, EU leaders, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. After the summit and the phone calls, Trump stated that Ukraine and Russia should go straight to agreeing on a final peace deal as he dropped his demand for a ceasefire.

Trump and Zelensky are due to have a meeting in the White House on August 18. The US leader said that if talks with Zelensky are a success, another meeting with Putin will be scheduled.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Experts warn of destabilized trading relations after White House strikes deal with Nvidia to take a 15% cut of certain AI chip sales to Chinese companies

Apple CEO Tim Cook visited the White House bearing an unusual gift. “This box was made in California,” Cook reassured his audience in the Oval Office this month, as he took off the lid.

Inside was a glass plaque, engraved for its recipient, and a slab for the plaque to sit on. “The base was made in Utah, and is 24-karat gold,” said Cook.

Donald Trump appeared genuinely touched by the gift.

But the plaque wasn't Cook's only offering: Apple announced that day it would invest another $100bn in US manufacturing.

The timing appeared to work well for Apple. That day, Trump said Apple would be among the companies that would be exempt from a new US tariff on imported computer chips.

The Art of the Deal looms large in the White House, where Trump is brokering agreements with powerful tech companies – in the midst of his trade war – that are reminiscent of the real estate transactions that launched him into fame.

But in recent days, this dealmaking has entered uncharted waters.

Two days after Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had a closed-door meeting with Trump at the White House. The president later announced Nvidia, along with its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), will be allowed to sell certain artificial intelligence chips to Chinese companies – so long as they share 15% of their revenue with the US government.

It was a dramatic about-face from Trump, who initially blocked the chips' exports in April. And it swiftly prompted suggestions that Nvidia was buying its way out of simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Trade experts say such a deal, where a company essentially pays the US government to export a good, could destabilize trading relations. Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that it creates “the perception that export controls are up for sale”.

“If you create the perception that licenses, which are supposed to be determined on pure national security grounds, are up for sale, you potentially open up room for there to be this wave of lobbying for all sorts of really, dangerous, sensitive technologies,” Chorzempa said. “I think that's a very dangerous precedent to set.”

Though the White House announced the deal, it technically hasn't been rolled out yet, likely because of legal complications. The White House is calling the deal a “revenue-sharing” agreement, but critics point out that it could also be considered a tax on exports, which may not be legal under US laws or the constitution.

The “legality” of the deal was “still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce”, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week.

Nvidia and AMD's AI chips are at the heart of the technological arms race between the US and China. Nvidia, which became the first publicly traded company to reach a $4tn valuation last month, creates the essential processing chips that are used to run and develop AI.

The US government has played a role in this arms race over the last several years, setting regulations on what AI chips and manufacturing equipment can be sent to China. If China has less computing power, the country will be slower to develop AI, giving a clear advantage to the US.

But despite the restrictions, China has been catching up, raising questions on how US policy should move forward.

“They haven't held them back as far as the advocates had hoped. The US has an enormous computing advantage over China, but their best models are only a few months behind our best models,” Chorzempa said. For US policymakers, “the question they've had to grapple with is: Where do you draw the line?”

The AI chips Nvidia and AMD can now sell to China aren't considered high-end. While they can be used for inference on trained models, they aren't powerful enough to train new AI models. When announcing the deal with Nvidia and AMD, Trump said the chip is “an old chip that China already possesses … under a different label”.

This is where a major debate on AI policy comes in. Those who take a hardline stance on the US's relationship with China say that allowing Chinese companies to purchase even an “old chip” could still help the country get an advantage over the US. Others would say a restriction on such chips wouldn't be meaningful, and could even be counterproductive.

To balance these two sides, the Trump administration is asking companies to pay up in order to export to China – a solution that people on both sides of the AI debate say is a precarious one.

“Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance AI capabilities,” said John Moolenaar, a Republican US representative from Michigan, in a statement.

But Trump's gut-reaction to dealmaking seems focused on the wallet. On Wednesday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent praised the arrangement and suggested it could be extended to other industries over time. “I think that right now this is unique, but now that we have the model and the beta test, why not expand it?” he told Bloomberg.

Julia Powles, executive director of the Institute for Technology, Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the deal opens up questions of whether similar pressure can be applied to other tech companies.

“What other quid pro quo might be asked in the future? The quid pro quo that would be of great concern to the [tech] sector is anything that reduces their reputation for privacy and security,” Powles said. “That's thinking of government like a transactional operator, not like an institution with rules about when, how and for what it can extract taxes, levies and subsidies.”

But that seems to be how the White House runs now. When explaining to the press how he made the deal, Trump said he told Huang: “I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you”.

“For the country, for our country. I don't want it myself,” the president added. “And he said, ‘Would you make it 15?' So we negotiated a little deal.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Union to challenge order issued less than 12 hours after start of action that has left more than 100,000 travellers stranded

Air Canada's flight attendants plan to remain on strike, their union has said, defying government efforts to force them back to work and into binding arbitration over a dispute that has left more than 100,000 travellers stranded around the world during the peak summer travel season.

About 10,000 flight attendants who work for Canada's largest airline walked out on the job early on Saturday amid a bitter dispute over what the union has described as “poverty wages” and unpaid labour.

Around the same time, Air Canada, which operates about 700 flights a day, said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.

Less than 12 hours later, the Canadian government said it had ordered an end to the work stoppage, leading Air Canada to announce plans to resume flying by Sunday evening. However, that timeline was thrown into question after the union told Reuters it would challenge the return-to-work order, which it described as unconstitutional.

It was the latest twist in talks that have dragged on since March as the flight attendants seek to address the fact that they are not compensated for work carried out when planes are not in the air such as time spent on the ground between flights or helping passengers to board.

On Saturday, Canada's federal jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, said it was clear the talks had reached an impasse and that the impact was being felt by Canadians and visitors across the country.

“The talks broke down,” said Hajdu as she told reporters that she had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order an immediate end to the strike and to impose binding arbitration. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”

She appeared to link her actions to the toll that US tariff increases had taken on the Canadian economy. “In a year in which Canadian families and businesses have already experienced too much disruption and uncertainty, this is not the time to add additional challenges and disruptions to their lives and our economy,” she said in a statement.

Hajdu's power to halt the strike stems from a section of the Canada Labour Code, which gives the minister unilateral authority to end work stoppages in order to “maintain or secure industrial peace”. While the section was rarely used by previous governments, the Liberal government has invoked it several times in the past year, quelling strikes by workers at Canadian ports, the post office and railway companies. Analysts have voiced concerns that the use of the clause may be undermining workers' rights.

The union representing the flight attendants decried the Liberal government for stepping in within hours, accusing it of violating their right to take job action. Air Canada had reportedly previously requested that the government intervene to impose binding arbitration.

Wesley Lesosky, of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the government was giving “Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation”.

According to the aviation analytics firm Cirium, the airline had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, leaving some travellers stranded overseas and others scrambling to find alternatives during the busy summer travel season. About 130,000 customers a day could be affected by a disruption, according to the airline.

The airline said earlier it had offered its flight attendants “an increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the union said the figure failed to fully account for inflation. Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully compensated for their labour.

About 70% of the airline's flight attendants are women, said Natasha Stea, a local union president and flight attendant. She questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada pilots, the vast majority of whom are men, received a significant raise last year.

“We are heartbroken for our passengers,” she told the Associated Press late last week. “Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans, but we cannot work for free.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Armed Forces of Ukraine has made gains in eastern Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff reported on Aug. 17.

The escalation in Donetsk Oblast follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's Aug. 15 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska, which ended without a deal amid Putin's reported demand that Ukraine cede the entire oblast.

From Aug. 4 to 16, Ukrainian forces cleared Russian troops from several villages in Donetsk Oblast. The settlements retaken were Hruzke, Rubizhne, Novovodiane, Petrivka, Vesele, and Zolotyi Kolodiaz.

The General Staff said Russian forces suffered significant losses in the area, including 910 killed, 335 wounded, and 37 captured. Ukrainian troops also reported destroying or damaging eight Russian tanks, six armored fighting vehicles, more than 100 vehicles and motorcycles, one multiple launch rocket system, 18 artillery pieces, and 91 drones.

Stabilization operations continue around Dobropillia, a town in Donetsk, where fighting has intensified in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials said six Russian soldiers surrendered to Ukrainian units on Aug. 16. 

Ukraine's 7th Air Assault Corps also reported clearing Russian positions in Pokrovsk, another key city in Donetsk Oblast.

Ukraine also said its forces advanced up to one kilometer near Yablunivka in Sumy Oblast, along the northern border with Russia.

Ukraine's military confirmed earlier on Aug. 16 that Russian troops captured two villages in Donetsk Oblast — Popiv Yar, southwest of Dobropillia, and Ivano-Darivka, northeast of Sloviansk.

Russian units have intensified attacks near the settlements of Novyi Shakhove, Rodynske, Myroliubivka, Novoekonomichne, Novoukrainka and Zvirove, as well as pushing west of Vuhledar, according to Ukraine's Dnipro Group of Forces. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia is trying to reach the administrative border of Donetsk Oblast to strengthen its position in potential future talks.

Zelensky said on Aug. 16 that the situation in Donetsk Oblast remains ""extremely difficult,"" noting that Ukrainian troops had carried out successful counterattacks around Dobropillia and Pokrovsk for a second consecutive day.

The fighting around Dobropillia has become one of the fiercest in recent months. Ukraine's General Staff said on Aug. 12 that Moscow had deployed more than 110,000 troops near Pokrovsk. 

Monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces had advanced north toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, though Ukrainian counterattacks have since recaptured some of that ground.

Ukraine's military has reportedly advanced about two kilometers (1.2 miles) in northeastern Sumy oblast, just a day after the United States and Russia discussed possible ""land swaps"" in Ukraine.

""Ukrainian soldiers continue to actively destroy the enemy and liberate our settlements,"" Ukraine's General Staff wrote on Telegram on Aug. 16. The military added that Ukrainian units had made gains in multiple areas in Sumy.

The reported advances come just a day after a high-profile meeting in Alaska between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, during which the two reportedly discussed a deal that would include giving up unoccupied Ukrainian territories to Russia.

As part of the deal, Russia would withdraw from parts of Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts, in exchange for the Ukrainian-controlled parts of the partially occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine, Russian forces reportedly captured two more villages in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's military said on Aug. 16.

Air Canada flight attendants will defy an order that they end their strike and return to their jobs after the federal government issued a back-to-work order, according to a statement from the Canadian Union of Public Employees.

The company said Sunday morning it would resume flights after the Canada Industrial Relations Board directed the airline and striking flight attendants to resume service operations for all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights at 2 p.m. ET.

However, the Air Canada component of CUPE, which represents the striking workers, said in a statement it will be “challenging this blatantly unconstitutional order that violates the Charter rights of 10,000 flight attendants.”

“We remain on strike. We demand a fair, negotiated contract and to be compensated for all hours worked,” the statement read.

Outside of Toronto Pearson International Airport, union executives insisted the strikers won't back down.

“This is a completely legal strike, with legal protests happening until 2 p.m. At that point, we will carry forward with the demonstrations. We're asking that the company come back to the table and deal with it,” said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada component of CUPE.

He said the only communication from the company Sunday was when it asked if the union had issued the directive to its membership.

While Air Canada has not updated its earlier statement that flights would begin to resume Sunday evening, “I can't see how flights can resume without flight attendants,” he said. 

“This ends when we say it's over, because we have something happening at the table,” he said.

Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the federal government issued a directive to end a cabin crew strike, with one union official calling it ""incredibly disgusting.""

As he spoke, lines of striking workers walked in a circle, chanting, “Say it loud, say it proud, unpaid work is not allowed.” They carried signs bearing the CUPE union flags that read, “We love our passengers, not poverty pay,” and “Would you work for free?” Several cars honked and people cheered for the group as they drove by.

Even without the latest threat of continued strike action, the Montreal-based airline said the complete shutdown of service early Saturday, which left crews out of position for its flights, meant it would take at least a week to restore full operations. 

Air Canada warned further flight cancellations will occur over the next week as it resumes normal operations.

The company did not immediately respond to questions about CUPE's announcement. 

“Air Canada expects it will take several days before its operations return to normal. During this process, some flights will be cancelled over the next seven to ten days until the schedule is stabilized,” the statement said.

Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu had directed the labour board to order the parties to resume work and extend the terms of the existing collective agreement until a new one could be determined by an arbitrator.

At Pearson Airport, uncertainty over the status of the strike was causing confusion among passengers. 

Sabrina Marrati, 34, travelled for the first time to Canada from Italy for a two-week honeymoon with her husband. She was scheduled to fly to Calgary from Toronto early Sunday morning, but her flight was cancelled. Air Canada was unable to book the couple on another flight because they were all sold out, she said.

“We have no alternatives right now. We're just here waiting for another flight which might come, but we don't know yet,” she said, as she stood with her luggage by the exit door at Pearson airport.

She said the airline is telling passengers to remain at the airport, or accept a refund. But Ms. Marrati and her husband, who spent a week on the east coast, already have a tour and hotels booked for a week out west. The trip cost them a total of about 10,000 Euros, she said.

“Terrible experience right now,” she said.

The flight cancellations have also left passengers who are stranded around the world furious at the lack of communication from the airline about the status of their tickets.

Lisa Pasquin's extended family has been on a two-week trip to Greece that was supposed to end Sunday with a flight back to Toronto.

Other than a single message from the airline last Friday advising her to wait before taking any action on her tickets, the Toronto resident didn't hear anything until Sunday at 1 a.m. Athens time, well after the strike had started, when Air Canada informed her the flight was cancelled.

In a text message to Ms. Pasquin, the airline said it searched for flights “on over 120 airlines for three days before and after” her cancelled flight but was “unable” to rebook her.

However, Ms. Pasquin had conducted her own search earlier, and found an alternate flight home, albeit by way of transfers at London's Heathrow airport and Newark, New Jersey, where the family must spend the night.

All told, she's out “thousands and thousands of dollars.” 

“I never in my wildest dreams imagined the response from Air Canada would be, ‘sorry, no flights, good luck,” said Ms. Pasquin, who holds Aeroplan Elite Status in the airline's loyalty program. “The company has shown an appalling disregard for both our emotional and financial wellbeing.” 

While union members picketed outside Toronto's Pearson Airport on Saturday, frustrated travellers inside huddled against banded barriers, waiting to speak with Air Canada representatives on the other side. Some sat in corners or against walls with stacked baggage carts. Others seemed frantic on laptops or on their phones, looking for accommodation or alternate flights, as demand, and prices, surged.

Drew Smith said he and his family drove two hours to Pearson to catch a flight to B.C. Saturday morning, only to find out that it had been cancelled.

“We're expected to be at work on Monday,” said Mr. Smith, of Kamloops, B.C., who was travelling with his wife and their kids. He said the children were being chauffeured around the area by their grandfather, to save them from the tension inside the airport.

Travellers affected by Air Canada strike scramble for answers at Toronto's Pearson airport

Abigail Jackson's flight to Nanaimo, B.C., where she was expecting to pick up an RV from storage, was also cancelled.

Ms. Jackson said she went to the airport on Friday, hoping to find a solution ahead of the strike, and was told that her Saturday flight was still scheduled to depart.

“Four different Air Canada representatives have said different answers to me in the last couple hours we've been here,” she said Saturday. Calls to Air Canada did not go through, she added.

The CIRB's decision ordered the airline and its flight attendants to resume duties and “to continue such operations and duties until the final binding interest arbitration is completed.”

The union's counsel had argued the Board needs to delay imposing the ministerial order to allow time to issue an injunction against it with the federal court. 

“We're dealing with an exceptional situation,” Benjamin Piper, counsel for the union, said Saturday night, adding that the order was used “to override a legal and authorized and constitutionally protected right to strike.”

Air Canada counsel argued it needs to implement Ms. Hajdu's order as quickly as possible, as it does not have jurisdiction to pause a ministerial order, including to await a federal court proceeding.

Christopher Pigott, counsel for Air Canada, said the Board was tasked with “getting Air Canada operating again to assist the thousands of people who are literally sitting in airports, in Canada, around the world, who are stranded.”

The board later decided to impose the order, also extending the terms of the existing collective agreement retroactive to when it expired and until a new agreement between the parties comes into effect.

The ruling follows a decision reached between both parties allowing flight attendants 12 hours to prepare after the order is issued, to ensure they are mentally and physically fit to prepare to work – meaning not fatigued or under the influence of alcohol or drugs – and to arrange child care. 

Also during the hearing late Saturday, Mr. Piper argued that board chair Maryse Trembley should recuse herself from the case because of her past connection to Air Canada, creating legal grounds for a reasonable apprehension of bias.

Ms. Tremblay said she was in-house counsel for Air Canada from 1998 to 2004, and later represented Air Canada in labour and human rights proceedings. She last represented Air Canada in a human rights matter in May, 2022.

In a decision made during the tribunal hearing, the board dismissed the union's assertions.

Airlines work to add flights, make schedule adjustments in face of Air Canada labour dispute

The airline had been winding down operations since Thursday in response to the union's strike notice, coming to a complete halt on Saturday when more than 10,000 airline flight attendants walked off the job and began picketing at major airports across Canada.

As of Friday evening, Air Canada had cancelled 623 flights, impacting more than 100,000 travellers. 

The company said customers whose flights were cancelled, who did not travel and did not accept a refund or credit, will be contacted with new itineraries.

If you've ever chalked up your exhaustion to just “a rough week,” you might want to look closer.

Burnout isn't always the dramatic crash we imagine. It often starts subtly, like a slow leak in your energy reserves, and if you're not paying attention, it can drain you completely.

“One of the biggest misconceptions about burnout is that it hits you all at once,” says Sharon Grossman, a psychologist, executive coach and author of The Burnout Solution: 7 Steps from Exhausted to Extraordinary. “In reality, it creeps in gradually.”

Dr. Grossman says early signs are easy to overlook or dismiss. Persistent fatigue, trouble focusing or snapping at coworkers may seem like small irritants, but they often signal something deeper.

“Many dismiss these as ‘just being tired' or ‘having a bad week,'” she says. “But these can actually be early indicators that your energy tank is running on empty.”

And when your coping resources are chronically depleted, burnout doesn't wait for a formal invitation.

One reason burnout is so hard to pin down is that it shows up differently for everyone.

“For some of my clients, it shows up as emotional exhaustion. They are dragging through the day, both physically and mentally,” Ms Grossman says. “For others, it's cynicism or detachment, where they stop caring about work they once loved.”

Even high performers aren't immune. In fact, they're often more vulnerable.

“I've seen high achievers become hyper-critical of themselves, feel like they're failing even when they're performing and start questioning their worth,” she says.

Dr. Grossman recalls experiencing burnout personally as a loss of meaning in her work. “When I stopped feeling excited about my sessions and started just going through the motions, I knew something had to shift.”

Burnout doesn't always look like collapse. Sometimes, it's the slow grind of pushing through until you break.

The tricky part? Stress and burnout can feel similar but they require different responses.

“Stress is situational. It has a clear beginning and end,” says Dr. Grossman. “Burnout, on the other hand, is chronic. It doesn't let up, even when circumstances improve.”

If taking a vacation or stepping away from work doesn't bring relief, that's a red flag. So is emotional numbness or a sense that your efforts no longer matter.

“It's when stress stops being energizing and starts feeling soul-crushing,” she says. “If you're feeling a lack of efficacy – like no matter how hard you try, you're not making progress – that's another hallmark of burnout.”

To catch burnout early, Dr. Grossman recommends building emotional intelligence. She calls self-awareness “your first line of defense.”

In her book, one of the foundational tools she shares is the “energy audit.”

“Ask yourself: What's draining me? What's fueling me?” she says. Journaling, mindfulness and monitoring your self-talk are also simple but powerful strategies.

Recognizing and regulating your emotions, setting healthy boundaries and having the emotional literacy to speak up are key, she says. 

Recovery also depends on those same skills. “It helps you reconnect with your values, navigate tough conversations and rebuild your confidence.”

In a culture that rewards overworking, understanding the early signs of burnout and acting on them is essential.

Stay tuned for part two next week, where I share insights from Dr. Grossman on what steps to take after you've identified burnout.

That's how many workers report feeling anxious upon returning to work after vacation, according to new data from global recruitment consultancy Robert Walters.

The delay in negotiations with the US is a setback for Indian business owners who will pay an additional 25% tariff that will kick in on August 27.

The United States has canceled trade negotiations with India, which were scheduled to take place in New Delhi between August 25 and 29, according to media reports.

The India-US negotiations for a trade deal, which had been going on since February, have been paused, Indian newspaper The Indian Express reported on Sunday, citing sources privy to the matter.

The upcoming round of talks, which was slated to take place in the last week of August, will now be held at a later date, according to Indian news channel NDTV.

The bilateral talks on trade are crucial for India, as the US has levied a 50% tariff on Indian goods — the highest on any country globally.

Indian traders have begun paying a 25% tariff already; however, the remaining 25% tariff is going to come into effect from August 27.

The delay in negotiations deals a blow to Indian manufacturers who were hoping to get some relief before the remaining tariff on Indian goods kicks in.

Tensions between India and the US escalated when, earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced an additional punitive 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing India's import of Russian oil.

So far, India and the US have held five rounds of negotiations, which have resulted in a stalemate over disagreement on opening India's vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.

US envoy Witkoff said  Russia made ""some concessions"" during the Alaska summit. Zelenskyy, who is to be accompanied by a group of European leaders, is more skeptical of Moscow's intentions. Follow DW for more.

This is a roundup on all the latest news regarding the war in Ukraine and the political discussions around it on Sunday, August 17, 2025.

Emmanuel Macron said European leaders would ask Donald Trump to what extent the US will support Ukraine's security guarantees when they meet in Washington DC on Monday.

Ukraine and its European allies have insisted that any peace deal to end the war be underpinned by a military deterrent.

Earlier on Sunday, White House envoy Steve Witkoff had said that Russia had agreed that the US could provide Ukraine with security guarantees that are similar to NATO's commitment to defending any member that is attacked.

But in his comments to reporters outside his official summer residence in Bregancon, the French leader also said he does not think Russian President Vladimir Putin is interested in ending the war.

""Do I think Putin wants peace? I think the answer is no,"" Macron said. 

""There is only one state proposing a peace that would be a capitulation: Russia,"" he added.

French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the US, Europe and Ukraine to present a united front during Monday's talks between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Macron was speaking after Kyiv's European allies held a meeting Sunday of the so-called Coalition of the Willing, an initiative led by the UK and France.

""If we show weakness today in front of Russia, we are laying the ground for future conflicts,"" Macron said.

Macron said ""our will is to present a united front between Europeans and Ukrainians"" and to ask the Americans ""to what extent"" they are ready to contribute to the security guarantees that would be offered to Ukraine in a peace agreement.

Macron also reiterated European leaders' insistence that no decisions be taken on Ukraine without the participation of Ukrainian authorities.

Similarly, the French leader said no decisions on Europe's security could be made without the input of European nations.

Ukraine will not give up any territory Russia hasn't yet occupied, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said standing alongside the EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. 

He seemed to be quashing Russian hopes of occupying more of Ukraine before it even agrees to a ceasefire and discusses lasting peace. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly told US President Donald Trump that one of the conditions for freezing the frontlines – that is not occupying anymore Ukrainian land, was, well, to occupy some more of it. 

According to a report in the Financial Times, Putin proposed to Trump that Ukraine withdraw from the eastern Donetsk region. In return, Moscow would stop its incursions in the rest of the country. 

But Zelenskyy isn't having it. 

He said Russia is still unsuccessful in the Donetsk region, even after trying to occupy it for 12 years, and that the constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible, ""to give up territory or trade land."" 

But he also sought clarity on the supposed future role of his allies in Europe, as well as the US.

The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU will continue to support Ukraine's path to its membership in the European Union. ""This in itself is also a security guarantee,"" she added. 

Even if Ukraine doesn't become a NATO member, the EU membership also offers similar guarantees, albeit minus the US's military might.  

The Mutual Defense Clause in the EU treaty states that if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, ""the other member states have an obligation to aid and assist it by all the means in their power."" 

A group of EU leaders concluded their Coalition of the Willing meeting on Sunday with a statement stressing their ""unity in supporting Ukraine toward a just and lasting peace.""

The meeting took place ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday.

""Discussions focused on key matters such as the need to stop the killing in Ukraine, the commitment to maintain full pressure against Russia via sanctions, the principle that it is for Ukraine to take decisions on its territory and the crucial topic of strong security guarantees that protect Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests,"" the EU statement read.

Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council, stressed the need to respect Ukraine's ""sovereign right to determine its conditions for peace.""

""We welcome the United States' willingness to participate in providing security guarantees to Ukraine — to deter future Russian aggression and to ensure, together, a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,"" Costa said. ""Europe stands ready to do its part.""

Russia has not indicated backing for a three-way summit with Ukraine and the United States floated by Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

""So far, Russia gives no sign that the trilateral will happen and if Russia refuses, then new sanctions must follow,"" Zelenskyy said in Brussels in a joint press conference with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.

The Ukrainian leader went on to say that the current front lines in his country's war against Russia should be the basis for peace talks.

""We need real negotiations, which means we can start where the front line is now,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that European leaders supported this.

He reiterated his position that it was necessary to establish a ceasefire to then negotiate a final deal.

Senior US envoy Steve Witkoff said he was ""hopeful"" of a ""productive meeting"" with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday, as Washington pushes for an end to the Ukraine war without first securing a ceasefire.

""I'm hopeful that we have a productive meeting on Monday, we get to real consensus, we're able to come back to the Russians and push this peace deal forward and get it done,"" Witkoff told US broadcaster CNN.

The envoy said Russia made ""some concessions"" during the Alaska summit over five Ukrainian regions central to Moscow's objectives, in an apparent reference to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea regions.

Witkoff said Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed that the US ""could offer Article 5-like protection"" to Ukraine, referring to NATO's commitment to defend any member who comes under attack.

The envoy said it was the first time he had heard the Russian leader agree to that, describing the security guarantees agreed as ""game-changing.""

He also defended US President Donald Trump's decision to abandon his push for Russia to agree to an immediate ceasefire, saying the president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

""We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,"" Witkoff said.

Trump, meanwhile, wrote on his Truth Social platform that there had been ""big progress"" on Russia, without elaborating.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS that both sides would need to make concessions if a peace deal were to be concluded.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Ukraine must be free to defend itself and seek support from any country it chooses, without interference or veto from Russia.

""There can be no limitations on Ukrainian armed forces: be it cooperation with other third countries or assistance from other third countries,"" von der Leyen told a news conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

She spoke just before a video call with other leaders of the Coalition of the Willing, a loose group of countries that have supported Kyiv over Russia's full-scale invasion.

""As I've often said, Ukraine must become a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders,"" von der Leyen added.

The Commission chief said she welcomed Washington's willingness to contribute to NATO security guarantees for Ukraine. She said the coalition, including the EU, is ""ready to do its share.""

The coalition is holding talks on Sunday, ahead of Zelenskyy's meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday. Several European leaders are set to join him in Washington DC to ensure Europe's voice is heard in the peace negotiations.

Russian forces shot down 300 Ukrainian drones and struck storage sites for Sapsan missiles, Russia's Defense Ministry and war bloggers said.

The ministry said Russian troops had sealed better positions in the eastern Donetsk region near the settlement of Zolotyi Kolodyaz, though pro-Ukrainian maps showed that Ukraine's forces had contained the Russian advance.

Moscow said warplanes, drones and missiles had been used to strike Ukrainian storage sites for Sapsan missiles across the country.

""Four guided aerial bombs and 300 aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles were shot down by air defense systems,"" the ministry said.

Moscow said many of the drones fired by Kyiv targeted border regions but also over the Nizhny Novgorod region east of Moscow, hundreds of kilometers from Ukraine. 

The acting governor of the border Kursk region, Alexander Khinstein, said a Ukrainian drone attack killed a man in his car.

Meanwhile, Kyiv's air force said Russia attacked Ukraine with 60 Iranian-made Shahed and other drones as well as an Iskander missile. 

Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said Russian attacks killed five people in the area on Saturday. 

Russia briefed Turkey and Hungary on Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which failed to secure a plan to end the war in Ukraine.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held calls with his Turkish and Hungarian counterparts on Saturday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Turkey has tried to maintain open diplomatic channels with both sides since Russia's full-scale invasion, positioning itself as a NATO member, a partner to both Moscow and Kyiv and a potential mediator.

Hungary has kept close ties with Russia throughout the war, often opposing EU sanctions and continuing energy cooperation with Moscow, and drawing criticism from Western allies of Kyiv.

Following the call, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he hoped for a peaceful settlement to the 3-1/2-year-old conflict.

""A durable resolution to the conflict is in our interest, as well as for peace and security to return to Central Europe,"" he said in a Facebook post.

Several European leaders are due to hold a video call on the Ukraine war, ahead of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's talks with US President Donald Trump next week.

Zelenskyy is in Brussels to participate in a video conference hosted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The leaders of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Sweden will also attend the Coalition of the Willing talks virtually.

The group is a loose team of nations backing Kyiv against Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

European Union states are wary of being sidelined in Trump's peace summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.

EU states have been pushing to ensure that Kyiv's views are not excluded from the US-Russia dialogue, which could shape Europe's long-term security.

Several European leaders are due to accompany Zelenskyy to his White House talks on Monday.

Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for peace talks with US President Donald Trump, the German government said Sunday.

The talks, in Washington DC on Monday, will also be attended by other European leaders, including the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU's executive arm.

French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer,  NATO chief Mark Rutte and Italian Prime Minister
Giorgia Meloni will also travel to Washington.

""The talks will address, among other things, security guarantees, territorial issues, and continued support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. This includes maintaining pressure on sanctions,"" the German government said.

The talks follow a much-anticipated summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, aimed at bringing the war to an end.

Despite Trump's warm welcome for the Kremlin leader, the meeting produced no breakthrough on halting the war.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","No more German visas for Kremlin critics fleeing Russia?","https://www.dw.com/en/no-more-german-visas-for-kremlin-critics-fleeing-russia/a-73664017","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 11:09:48 GMT","

Hundreds of opponents of the Moscow regime have fled Russia and are now stuck in countries where they aren't safe. Many hope to come to Germany on a humanitarian visa, but Berlin has just suspended these visa programs.

Some 300 Russians and Belarussians may be prevented from obtaining visas for Germany after Berlin suspended its humanitarian visa programs at the end of July, according to the Ark project (Kovcheg).

Founded in March 2022, The Ark supports Russians fleeing persecution by the Russian authorities, in particular opponents of Russia's war against Ukraine.

In all these cases, visas had already been approved by the German Foreign Office — but the Ministry of the Interior has stopped them from being issued.

One of those affected is Alexei Moskalev, a Russian man who was persecuted in his homeland because of a drawing his young daughter did in school. The drawing showed Russia firing rockets at Ukraine, with a mother standing in front of a child, holding up a hand to ward them off.

Masha Moskaleva from the Russian region of Tula was 13 years old when she did the drawing in an art class in the spring of 2022, not long after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The drawing was seized on by the international media after the Russian authorities took an interest in it.

According to the girl's father, Alexei Moskalev, the school administration reported the drawing to the police, and Masha was interviewed by members of Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB.

In 2023, Moskalev was sentenced to two years in prison. The court found him guilty of discrediting the army in anti-war comments he was said to have made on a Russian social network, Odnoklassniki. State authorities sent his daughter Masha to an orphanage before later handing her over to her mother, who had been estranged from the family for several years.

Moskalev left Russia after his release from prison in October 2024, as he was in danger of being arrested again. ""When I was in prison, in Vladimir Putin's dungeons, FSB officers came to see me twice,"" he says. ""They always stressed, at the end of our conversation, 'We're not going to leave you alone, even after you're released.'""

Anton K. (name changed for security reasons) left Russia at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Back home, the former activist and journalist worked with publications branded ""foreign agents"" by the authorities. Today, he works for an online medium whose editor-in-chief is in custody, accused of inciting terrorism.

Anton K. also took part in anti-Kremlin protests, and was arrested many times in consequence. Russia's ""Center for Combating Extremism"" took his fingerprints so that, if necessary, it could find him more easily.

Like Alexei Moskalev, Anton K. is also currently in one of the CIS states. The Commonwealth of Independent States is an organization of Soviet Union successor states, and in addition to Russia it consists of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Lawyer Anastasia Burakova is the founder of Kovcheg, the Ark Project that supports Russian dissidents abroad. She told DW that it was dangerous for opponents of the regime to stay in these countries long-term. ""There's always the risk of an extradition request from Russia if a person is wanted in a politically motivated case,"" Burakova says.

""There are abduction attempts, like those we've seen in Armenia, but there are also successful abductions, as in Kyrgyzstan; those people ended up in Russian prisons.""

Anton K. and Alexei Moskalev were very aware of these risks, so they applied for humanitarian visas for Germany, along with some 300 other Russians and Belarusians. German authorities can issue this visa to independent journalists, activists, and politicians who are persecuted in their home countries.

According to The Ark, around 2,600 people from Russia have been granted these visas for Germany in the past three-and-a-half years of the war. ""More than 2,600 people have been given the chance to come to a safe place, to evade a Russian prison sentence, torture, and persecution for their civil society activism and their opposition to the war,"" Anastasia Burakova stresses.

At the end of July this year, Germany's Ministry of the Interior announced that it was suspending the humanitarian visa program. The reason given was the coalition contract between the governing parties, the CDU/CSU and the SPD, which refers to a toughening of migration policy.

Anton K.'s visa was almost in the bag. At the beginning of July, he was invited to present his passport at the German embassy in order to receive the visa. However, at this point the procedure was broken off. Anton's passport is still at the embassy.

Alexei Moskalev had a similar experience. He says the German Foreign Office had already approved his visa, but because of the new government's decision, he hasn't received it. It has been more than six months since he submitted the required documents.

The German Ministry of the Interior told DW that the governing parties' coalition agreement included the intention to ""terminate voluntary federal admission programs as far as possible,"" and said they were currently examining how this could be implemented with regard to the various programs.

""We cannot preempt the outcome of this review,"" it stated. ""Until a decision is made, procedures for the admission of persons in order to safeguard the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany under Section 22, Paragraph 2 of the Residence Act are also generally suspended, meaning that, in principle, new admissions will not be declared nor visas issued, except in urgent cases."" The ministry added that exceptions could be made ""in particularly special individual cases.""

Anastasia Burakova hopes that this wording means that it will indeed make exceptions. It will become clear in practice what exactly the German authorities regard as ""urgent cases,"" she says.

In August of this year, there were 1,043 people categorized by the Russian human rights organization Memorial as political prisoners in Russia. According to the independent Russian news portal The Bell, which operates outside the country, around 700,000 people have left Russia since the start of its all-out war against Ukraine.

Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, was killed in a drive-by shooting on the evening of June 30 while undertaking a summer internship at a congressman's office in the nation's capital.

Following Eric's death, his mother, Tamara Tarpinian-Jachym, 62, never heard from Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington DC.

“I never heard from her. Never a letter, never a call. That was a slap in the face,” the married mother of three told The Telegraph. “As far as I'm concerned, she thought Eric was a piece of dirt.

“You couldn't even have someone pen you a letter and sign your name to it? She has no class.”

The University of Massachusetts Amherst student was one of several victims of gun violence mentioned by Donald Trump as he announced plans earlier this week to take federal control of the city's police department.

When Mr Trump invoked Eric's killing, Ms Tarpinian-Jachym said it made her feel like her son “didn't die in vain”.

“I was looking at his urn and a picture next to it of his beautiful, blue eyes. I cried and I said: ‘Eric, you didn't die in vain. You're not a number. They're going to do something. They're going to get control of these criminals doing these dangerous acts.'”

On Monday, the president announced he was deploying 800 National Guard troops to Washington and temporarily taking over the city's police department, as he vowed to “rescue our nation's capital from crime”.

The impetus for his decision appeared to be an attack last week on Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) staffer nicknamed “Big Balls”, who was left bloodied and bruised in an attempted carjacking.

“He's lucky to be alive,” Mr Trump said.

National Guard troops descended on the National Mall on Tuesday evening, joining hundreds of law enforcement officers who reported having made dozens of arrests since the start of the 30-day operation.

Mr Trump has said that the law enforcement blitz in Washington DC could serve as a blueprint to expand his efforts to other Democrat-run cities such as Chicago that he claims have been overrun by crime.

The move has been met with pushback from Democrats and members of the public accusing Mr Trump of an authoritarian power grab.

Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, dismissed Mr Trump's clampdown, sharing a department of justice press release from January showing violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low.

“As you listen to an unhinged Trump try to justify deploying the National Guard in DC, here's reality,” the Democratic former presidential candidate wrote on X.

Ms Bowser has called Mr Trump's deployment of officers in her city “unsettling and unprecedented”, casting his actions as part of an “authoritarian push”.

One DC resident was charged with assault on Sunday for hurling a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officer and yelling: “I don't want you in my city!”

Meanwhile groups of demonstrators flocked to a law enforcement checkpoint in the capital, with hecklers yelling: “Go home, fascists” and “Get off our streets”.

Despite White House claims that Washington DC is “anything but safe”, overall crime so far this year is down by seven per cent from 17,136 to 15,921 compared to last year, according to official statistics which the president rejects.

The capital was rocked by a surge in violent crime in 2023, which included the city's highest number of homicides since the late 1990s and a near-doubling of reported carjackings compared to the previous year.

However, both have fallen dramatically following the implementation of a host of initiatives and law changes to deal with violent offenders.

So far this year, violent crime is down 26 per cent on last year and 35 per cent since 2023.

Yet Democrats' efforts to dismiss Mr Trump's crackdown on crime fail to appreciate the public mood over perceived lawlessness in the capital.

Videos of masked young people ransacking shops in the capital are commonplace on social media, with teenagers making off with whole wardrobes-full of clothes and leaving products strewn across the pavements.

Last year, Washington DC had the fourth-highest homicide rate in the country – nearly six times higher than New York City.

And despite overall crime declining between 2023 and 2024, the percentage of residents who said crime is a very or extremely serious problem rose from 56 per cent to 65 per cent, according to a Washington Post poll.

The crime statistics themselves have been a source of controversy, with Mr Trump telling reporters on Thursday that city officials have been placed “under investigation” for producing “phoney crime stats”.

Republicans responded to criticism of the measures by saying that the capital should be “a symbol of safety and strength” and accusing the city's Democrat-run council of pursuing a “radical, soft-on-crime agenda”.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said that “every American should be able to visit and enjoy Washington DC without fear”.

Meanwhile Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the capital, hit back at questions over the drop in crime rate, saying: “It's never enough”, pointing to Eric's killing.

“You tell the mother of the intern who was shot going out for McDonald's near the Washington Convention Centre, ‘Oh, crime is down.'”

Of particular concern are young offenders, with the number of juveniles arrested in the capital increasing every year since 2020, according to statistics from 2024.

Juveniles accounted for 51.8 per cent of all robbery arrests in 2024, according to the city's police department, while the majority of carjackings in the year ending in July 2025 have been carried out by juveniles.

In the case of Mr Coristine, two 15-year-olds have been charged with unarmed carjacking.

Yet for Ms Tarpinian-Jachym, the search for justice over her son's death continues.

The retired occupational therapist welcomed Mr Trump's law and order crackdown, saying the influx of officers would free up the police to fight crime rather than spending time in court and doing paperwork.

Her message to the president's critics? “It's four weeks of your life. If people don't want to be safe, my question is why?

“I just want people to realise that it's about everybody in DC. My son is gone, it's not going to bring him back, but it may prevent another family from going through the living hell we go through every day.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","These city leaders want to expand HBCUs beyond the South. Here's why they say it's critical as DEI is under attack","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/17/us/hbcu-expansion-satellite-campuses","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            Kei'Yanii Dawson dreams of attending a historically Black college where she can take classes and engage in campus life with more students who look like her.
    


            But Dawson, a junior at a majority-White private high school in San Francisco, said that would likely mean going to school far from home and taking on more debt for housing and out-of-state tuition.
    


            However, a growing movement to expand the presence of HBCUs into more communities outside the South could soon give students like Dawson easier access to a Black college.
    


            Officials in cities such as Boston and San Francisco say they are actively working to bring satellite campuses of HBCUs to their communities, hoping to strengthen the pipeline for Black students to pursue higher education and to grow and diversify their local economies.
    


            “I feel like if there was a satellite (HBCU) here in San Francisco, it would just be so much easier,” Dawson said. “An education coming to me instead of me going so far, there's definitely more benefits from that, money-wise.”
    


            Advocates for HBCUs insist these proposals are critical as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion programs at predominantly White institutions, such as Harvard University, and as Black students seek schools where they feel included and celebrated.
    


            President Donald Trump has decried DEI initiatives as “illegal and immoral discrimination.”



            Earlier this year, the Trump administration proposed a 2026 fiscal year budget that would cut $64 million in funding for Howard University, the nation's only federally chartered HBCU. The National Institutes of Health also canceled a $16.3 million grant for Florida A&M University's pharmacy school as part of Trump's effort to end DEI programs.
    


            US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher on Thursday struck down two administration actions that threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions with DEI programs, ruling the Education Department violated the law, according to The Associated Press.
    


            Despite his administration's attacks on DEI, Trump signed an executive order in April supporting HBCUs.
    


            “This order will continue the work begun during my first Administration to elevate the value and impact of our Nation's HBCUs as beacons of educational excellence and economic opportunity that serve as some of the best cultivators of tomorrow's leaders in business, government, academia, and the military,” it read.
    


            HBCUs were first established in the mid to late 1800s, when legal segregation in the South prevented Black students from enrolling in existing colleges and schools in the North imposed quotas on the number of Black students who could attend. During this period, HBCUs became the primary means of providing a college education to Black people. Today, the majority of HBCUs are located in the South.
    


            Keith Lezama, CEO and founder of Building Bridges Education — a nonprofit dedicated to providing New England students with access and pathways to HBCUs — said he supports the expansion of Black colleges. He said many Black families in communities without HBCUs are not aware of their impact.
    


            HBCUs “are a movement that has allowed access when access wasn't allowed,” Lezama said. “A movement that instills a sense of pride, resilience that produces amazing leaders in our communities and across the world. To know many of these institutions do this without the same resources (as predominantly White colleges), is something that can be seen as a national model of what excellence looks like in education.”
    


            In June, Boston City Councilor Brian Worrell filed a hearing order proposing the establishment of an HBCU satellite campus in Boston.  He said during a June 25 city council meeting that Boston is known for being a college town, “but we do not have a single HBCU.”
    


            The closest HBCUs to Boston are Cheyney University of Pennsylvania and Lincoln University, both more than 300 miles away.
    


            HBCUs, Worrell said, are known for producing a higher percentage of low-income, first-generation Black college graduates than majority-White institutions.
    


            “If we are serious about building a diverse workforce here in Boston in tech, health care, education, government, then we need to be just as serious about the pipelines that people get here,” Worrell said.
    


            Establishing a satellite campus is a lengthy process that could take years to complete, advocates say.
    


            Worrell said it is not yet clear if or when the HBCU would open in Boston, and officials have not yet decided which school the city will partner with.
    


            Boston is hosting a listening session on August 26 to allow community members to share their thoughts on what they want to see in a satellite campus, he said. Worrell will consider their feedback in his proposal for the school.
    


            He also hopes to work with HBCUs on an initiative that would allow students at local institutions to transfer credits to the satellite school when it opens.
    


            Officials from Huston-Tillotson University, a small private HBCU in Austin, Texas, say they are also working to establish an off-campus instructional site in San Diego.
    


            California has the largest out-of-state student enrollment at Huston-Tillotson, said Archibald Vanderpuye, the university's provost and vice president of academic affairs. The school is located about 1,300 miles from San Diego.
    


            “Our partners are looking at ways to increase access to and completion of college degrees among underrepresented minority students by providing them with meaningful HBCU experiences,” Beverly Downing, associate provost at Huston-Tillotson University, said in a statement.
    


            Downing said there is growing interest among students and families in expanding the school to California.
    


            “We started getting a lot of calls and getting requests for a presence there so that the students would have a choice of whether to come out to Texas or to take courses (in California),” Downing said.
    


            The university plans to launch the off-campus instructional site in San Diego with a business administration program in spring 2026, Downing said.
    


            Plans for the San Diego location are underway and the school is required to obtain numerous approvals, including for the off-campus instructional site plan and accreditation, Downing said.
    


            In San Francisco, officials are also in active discussions about bringing an HBCU satellite campus to the city, Charles Lutvak, spokesperson for Mayor Daniel Lurie, said.
    


            Lutvak said he was unable to provide details on a timeline or which Black colleges are in discussions with city leaders.
    


            The conversations follow the city's launch of the Black 2 San Francisco initiative last year, which seeks to “create a satellite campus partnership with several HBCUs, including a physical location in San Francisco, and a full suite of academic and professional programming.”
    


            Former Mayor London Breed said last year that an HBCU campus in San Francisco would “boost our downtown and our economy, while bringing new minds and ideas to grow within our world-renowned culture of innovation.”
    


            Harry Williams, president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, said developing satellite locations for HBCUs across the country will help increase the number of Black Americans in the middle class.
    


            HBCUs produce 70% of Black doctors and dentists, 50% of Black engineers and 35% of Black attorneys, according to the United Negro College Fund.
    


            Williams said HBCUs have higher retention and graduation rates among Black students.
    


            Black students can also experience a sense of belonging and culture at HBCUs that they may not find at predominantly White institutions, where DEI and affirmative action are under attack, Williams said.
    


            “Being in a place where you are wanted, that's the key,” he said. “These institutions were created for African Americans.”
    


            Some people, however, oppose expanding HBCUs to other communities.
    


            “You want to attend an HBCU, then move to a city where the school history and culture already exist,” one user posted on X. “Our resources are stretched enough. Plus, our cities depend on the migration of students from the North.”
    


            “One of the lures of HBCUs is the historical part and putting a satellite campus somewhere random disconnects that,” another user posted on X. “Especially in Boston.”
    


            Brandon Graham, founder and CEO of Our HBCUs Matter Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to educational programming for high school and HBCU students, said he believes it will be challenging for satellite campuses to replicate the connections and experiences students receive on an HBCU's main campus. However, he said there are creative ways to achieve this.
    


            HBCUs must “ensure that you cultivate programmatic models and bring in alumni for those folks who are local to then be able to share and cultivate that synergy that you initially get on an HBCU campus,” said Graham, a graduate of both Clark Atlanta University and Tennessee State University.
    


            Graham said he is confident that HBCUs have the connections and resources to expand their reach to communities across the country, just as predominantly White institutions have done.
    


            “It will have positive effects on the institutional educational branding, on its financials, as well as on its ability to cultivate a very diverse alumni base across the country,” Graham said. “This next level of satellite campuses is going to diversify and transform the way an HBCU education can be provided.”

            Greg Iles, the Mississippi author of the “Natchez Burning” trilogy and other works, has died. He was 65.
    


            Iles died Friday after a decades-long battle with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, his literary agent Dan Conaway posted Saturday on Facebook.
    


            Initially diagnosed with the incurable condition in 1996, he kept his illness private until completing his final novel, “Southern Man,” which was published in 2024.
    


            Iles was born in Germany but moved to Natchez, Mississippi, with his family when he was just three years old and developed a deep connection with the region. Many of his stories are set in Mississippi, including the “Natchez Burning” trilogy, historical fiction suspense novels exploring race and class in the 1960s Jim Crow South.
    


            Conaway described Iles as “warm, funny, fearless, and completely sui generis.”
    


            “To be on the other end of the phone as he talked through character and plot, problem-solving on the fly, was to be witness to genius at work, plain and simple,” he wrote on Saturday. “As a writer he fused story-craft, bone-deep humanity, and a growing sense of moral and political responsibility with the ferocious precisions of a whirling dervish or a master watchmaker.”
    


            In March 2011, Iles suffered a ruptured aorta and a partial leg amputation and spent eight days in a medically induced coma after another driver struck his car on Highway 61 near Natchez. He eventually recovered.
    


            Iles performed with the musical group The Rock Bottom Remainders along with popular authors Stephen King, Amy Tan and others.

NEW YORK (AP) — Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.

“We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” he told CNN's “State of the Union.” He added that it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called them “game-changing.”

Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.

Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.

Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. “We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the ‘Coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share,” she said.




Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but that much was unclear.

“It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,” he said, “But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees,” he said.

Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which Trump had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

“We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. “We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.”

Rubio, who appeared on three Sunday news shows, said there was not going to be any kind of truce reached because Ukraine was not at the summit.

“Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.”

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, said he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.

“The minute you issue new sanctions, your ability to get them to the table, our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished,” Rubio told NBC's “Meet the Press.”

He also said “we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement” and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work.

“We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off,” Rubio said.

Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.

“I think everybody agreed that we had made progress. Maybe not enough for a peace deal, but we are on the path for the first time,” Witkoff said.

He added: “The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians -- that could not have been discussed at this meeting” with Putin. “We intend to discuss it on Monday. Hopefully we have some clarity on it and hopefully that ends up in a peace deal very, very soon.”

As President Donald Trump declared Washington, D.C., a crime-ridden wasteland in need of federal intervention this week and threatened similar federal interventions in other Black-led cities, several mayors compared notes.

The president's characterization of their cities contradicts what they began noticing last year: that they were seeing a drop in violent crime after a pandemic-era spike. In some cases the declines were monumental, due in large part to more youth engagement, gun buyback programs and community partnerships.

Now members of the African American Mayors Association are determined to stop Trump from burying accomplishments that they already felt were overlooked. And they're using the administration's unprecedented law enforcement takeover in the nation's capital as an opportunity to disprove his narrative about some of the country's greatest urban enclaves.

“It gives us an opportunity to say we need to amplify our voices to confront the rhetoric that crime is just running rampant around major U.S. cities. It's just not true,” said Van Johnson, mayor of Savannah, Georgia, and president of the African American Mayors Association. “It's not supported by any evidence or statistics whatsoever.”

After deploying the first of 800 National Guard members to Washington, the Republican president is setting his sights on other cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland, California, calling them crime-ridden and “horribly run.” One thing they all have in common: They're led by Black mayors.




“It was not lost on any member of our organization that the mayors either were Black or perceived to be Democrats,” Johnson said. “And that's unfortunate. For mayors, we play with whoever's on the field.”

The federal government's actions have heightened some of the mayors' desires to champion the strategies used to help make their cities safer.

Trump argued that federal law enforcement had to step in after a prominent employee of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was attacked in an attempted carjacking. He also pointed to homeless encampments, graffiti and potholes as evidence of Washington “getting worse.” 

However statistics published by Washington's Metropolitan Police contradict the president and show violent crime has dropped there since a post-pandemic peak in 2023.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson scoffed at Trump's remarks, hailing the city's “historic progress driving down homicides by more than 30% and shootings by almost 40% in the last year alone.” 

Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, where homicides fell 14% between 2023 and 2024, called the federal takeover nothing but a performative “power grab.”

In Baltimore, officials say they have seen historic decreases in homicides and nonfatal shootings this year, and those have been on the decline since 2022, according to the city's public safety data dashboard. Carjackings were down 20% in 2023, and other major crimes fell in 2024. Only burglaries have climbed slightly. 

The lower crime rates are attributed to tackling violence with a “public health” approach, city officials say. In 2021, under Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore created a Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan that called for more investment in community violence intervention, more services for crime victims and other initiatives. 

Scott accused Trump of exploiting crime as a “wedge issue and dog whistle” rather than caring about curbing violence. 

“He has actively undermined efforts that are making a difference saving lives in cities across the country in favor of militarized policing of Black communities,” Scott said via email. 

The Democratic mayor pointed out that the Justice Department has slashed over $1 million in funding this year that would have gone toward community anti-violence measures. He vowed to keep on making headway, regardless. 

“We will continue to closely work with our regional federal law enforcement agencies, who have been great partners, and will do everything in our power to continue the progress despite the roadblocks this administration attempts to implement,” Scott said.

Just last week Oakland officials touted significant decreases in crime in the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2024, including a 21% drop in homicides and a 29% decrease in all violent crime, according to the midyear report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Officials credited collaborations with community organizations and crisis response services through the city's Department of Violence Prevention, established in 2017. 

“These results show that we're on the right track,” Mayor Barbara Lee said at a news conference. “We're going to keep building on this progress with the same comprehensive approach that got us here.” 

After Trump gave his assessment of Oakland this week, she rejected it as “fearmongering.” 

Social justice advocates agree that crime has gone down and say Trump is perpetuating exaggerated perceptions that have long plagued Oakland. 

Nicole Lee, executive director of Urban Peace Movement, an Oakland-based organization that focuses on empowering communities of color and young people through initiatives such as leadership training and assistance to victims of gun violence, said much credit for the gains on lower crime rates is due to community groups. 

“We really want to acknowledge all of the hard work that our network of community partners and community organizations have been doing over the past couple of years coming out of the pandemic to really create real community safety,” Lee said. “The things we are doing are working.” 

She worries that an intervention by military forces would undermine that progress. 

“It creates kind of an environment of fear in our community,” Lee said.

In Washington, agents from multiple federal agencies, National Guard members and even the United States Park Police have been seen performing law enforcement duties from patrolling the National Mall to questioning people parked illegally. 

Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said the guard troops will not be armed but declined to elaborate on their assignments to safety patrols and beautification efforts. 

Savannah's Johnson said he is all for partnering with the federal government, but troops on city streets is not what he envisioned. Instead, cities need federal assistance for things like multistate investigation and fighting problems such as gun trafficking, and cybercrimes.

“I'm a former law enforcement officer. There is a different skill set that is used for municipal law enforcement agencies than the military,” Johnson said.

There has also been speculation that federal intervention could entail curfews for young people. 

But that would do more harm, Nicole Lee said, disproportionately affecting young people of color and wrongfully assuming that youths are the main instigators of violence.

“If you're a young person, basically you can be cited, criminalized, simply for being outside after certain hours,” Lee said. “Not only does that not solve anything in regard to violence and crime, it puts young people in the crosshairs of the criminal justice system.”

For now, Johnson said, the mayors are watching their counterpart in Washington, Muriel Bowser, closely to see how she navigates the unprecedented federal intervention. She has been walking a fine line between critiquing and cooperating since Trump's takeover, but things ramped up Friday when officials sued to try to block the takeover.

Johnson praised Bowser for carrying on with dignity and grace. 

“Black mayors are resilient. We are intrinsically children of struggle,” Johnson said. “We learn to adapt quickly, and I believe that we will and we are.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — American lawmakers are using a trip to South Korea and Japan to explore how the United States can tap those allies' shipbuilding expertise and capacity to help boost its own capabilities, which are dwarfed by those of China.

Sens. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Andy Kim, D-N.J., who are scheduled to land in Seoul on Sunday before traveling to Japan, plan to meet top shipbuilders from the world's second- and third-largest shipbuilding countries. The senators want to examine the possibilities of forming joint ventures to construct and repair noncombatant vessels for the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific and bring investments to American shipyards. 

“We already have fewer capacity now than we did during Operation Iraqi Freedom” in 2003, Duckworth told The Associated Press. “We have to rebuild the capacity. At the same time, what capacity we have is aging and breaking down and taking longer and more expensive to fix.”

Their trip comes as President Donald Trump demands a plan to revive U.S. shipyards and engage foreign partners. The Pentagon is seeking $47 billion for shipbuilding in its annual budget. The urgency stems from the fact that Washington severely lags behind China in building naval ships, a situation raising alarms among policymakers who worry the maritime balance of power could shift to China, now the world's No. 1 shipbuilder.

Duckworth, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she hopes the trip could lead to joint ventures among the U.S. military, American companies and foreign partners to build auxiliary vessels for the Navy and small boats for the Army.

Another possibility is repairing U.S. ships in the Indo-Pacific region. 




“If we have to bring ships all the way back to the United States ... to wait two years to be fixed, that doesn't help the situation,” Duckworth said.

The discussions, she said, will focus on auxiliary vessels, which are noncombatant ships such as fueling and cargo vessels that support naval and military operations. The Navy's auxiliary fleet is aging and insufficient in numbers, she said.

The U.S. commercial shipbuilding accounted for 0.1% of global capacity in 2024, while China produced 53%, followed by South Korea and Japan, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. A Navy review from April 2024 found that many of its major shipbuilding programs were one year to three years behind schedule. 

During the trip, the senators are expected to meet representatives from major shipbuilders in the region. 

South Korea and the U.S. are already making progress on shipbuilding cooperation. In March, Hanwha Ocean completed maintenance work for a 41,000-ton U.S. Navy dry cargo and ammunition ship in South Korea. The overhaul of USNS Wally Schirra was the Korean company's first project after it secured a repair agreement with the U.S. Navy in July 2024.

Hanwha Group last year acquired Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, which builds large merchant mariners, part of the reserve auxiliary fleet.

Earlier this month, South Korea proposed to invest $150 billion in the U.S. shipbuilding industry to support Trump's “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” initiative as part of its tariffs talk with the White House.

Duckworth said she had earlier conversations with Hyundai Heavy Industries “about them actually buying into U.S. shipyards on U.S. soil”.

This month, China formed the world's biggest shipbuilding company by merging two state-owned shipbuilders. The combined entity China State Shipbuilding Corporation produces Chinese navy's combat vessels from aircraft carriers to nuclear submarines. It commands 21.5% of global shipbuilding market.

Hurricane Erin exploded in strength to a Category 5 storm in the Caribbean on Saturday, rapidly powering up from a tropical storm in a single day, the National Hurricane Center said.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Hurricane Erin exploded in strength and became a major storm in Atlantic waters just north of the Caribbean on Saturday, rapidly powering up from a tropical storm in a single day and bringing heavy rains and high winds to islands in the region. 

The first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, Erin reached Category 5 status before weakening somewhat and becoming a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 

Late Saturday night, the center reported that Erin was “undergoing structural changes” but was still “formidable” as its rain and winds buffeted Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The storm's center was about 145 miles (230 kilometers) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and it was heading toward the west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). It was not forecast to make a direct hit on land. 

Hurricane center director Mike Brennen said Erin grew into a “very powerful hurricane,” with its winds gaining 60 mph (96 kph) in about nine hours.

Forecasters predicted it will remain a major hurricane into the coming week.




The storm's center was forecast pass north of Puerto Rico, according to the National Hurricane Center. Nevertheless, it said, heavy rain in some areas could trigger flash flooding, landslides and mudslides.

Tropical storm watches were issued for St. Martin, St. Barts and the Turks and Caicos Islands. 

The National Weather Service in San Juan issued an alert for Saturday night for nearly two thirds of Puerto Rico, warning of 50 mph (80 kph) winds and urging people to shelter in safe structures. Power was knocked out to about 130,000 customers in the territory. 

Locals and tourists walked and shopped as usual earlier in the day in Puerto Rico's capital. Restaurants were busy, and despite warnings to avoid beaches, people could be seen in the water. 

Sarahí Torres and Joanna Cornejo, who were visiting from California for a Bad Bunny concert, said they decided to go to the beach and wade in because the skies were calm.

“The weather looked fine, so we came out,” Torres said.

The U.S. government deployed more than 200 employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies as a precaution. Puerto Rico Housing Secretary Ciary Pérez Peña said 367 shelters were inspected and ready to open if needed.

Officials in the Bahamas also prepared shelters and urged people to monitor the storm's progress.

Powerful rip currents could affect the U.S. East Coast from Florida to the mid-Atlantic next week, despite the eye of the storm forecast to remain far offshore, Brennan said.

Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin gained strength at a pace that was “incredible for any time of year, let alone Aug. 16.” 

Lowry said only four other Category 5 hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic on or before Aug. 16. 

The most powerful storms tend to form later in the year, with the hurricane season typically peaking in mid-September.

In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma rocketed from a tropical storm to a Category 5 in less than 24 hours, according to National Hurricane Center advisories from that time. Wilma weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida. And in October 2007, Hurricane Felix took just over a day to go from a tropical storm to Category 5.

Including Erin, there have been 43 hurricanes that have reached Category 5 status on record in the Atlantic, said Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private forecasting company.

“They're certainly rare, although this would mark the fourth year in a row that we've had one in the Atlantic basin,” Pydynowski said.

Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly. 

Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Hurricane Erick, a Pacific storm that made landfall June 19 in Oaxaca, Mexico, also strengthened rapidly, doubling in intensity in less than a day.

Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 and is expected to be unusually busy. Six to 10 hurricanes are predicted for the season, including three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph).

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff discusses the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska and the next steps to end the Russia-Ukraine war on ‘Fox News Sunday.'

U.S. Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff claims Russian President Vladimir Putin made ""robust"" steps toward peace during his meeting with President Donald Trump last week.

Witkoff made the statement during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" with host Shannon Bream. The official was in the room for the Alaska meeting and has met previously with Putin several times.

""We agreed on much more robust security guarantees,"" Witkoff said. ""The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders.""

Witkoff also said Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders directly after the meeting. He said the meeting was ""absolutely acknowledged as a win.""

Bream pressed Witkoff to explain why Trump did not push Putin for a ceasefire agreement during the meeting as well. Trump had previously said a ceasefire was a top priority and claimed Putin would face consequences if he didn't agree to one.

""The president has always talked about a ceasefire, until he made a lot of different wins in this meeting and began to realize that we could be talking about a peace deal. The ultimate deal here is a peace deal, and we were talking about much more robust security guarantees than anyone ever imagined,"" he said.

In a statement after the call with Trump, major European leaders did not address whether they preferred a peace deal over a ceasefire.

TRUMP: WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE DEAL, 'NOT A MERE CEASEFIRE'

The leaders said they ""welcomed President Trump's efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia's war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace.""

Putin described his talks with Trump in Alaska as ""very frank.""

""We, of course, respect the position of the American administration, which sees the need for a speedy end to military actions,"" Putin said at the follow-up meeting at the Kremlin, adding that ""we would like to move to resolving all issues by peaceful means.""

""ESPN, Colin Kaepernick and Spike Lee have collectively decided to no longer proceed with this project as a result of certain creative differences,"" ESPN told Reuters in a statement. ""Despite not reaching finality, we appreciate all the hard work and collaboration that went into this film.""

Lee told Reuters on Friday that the documentary was not coming out and that's all he could say. He later added that he signed a nondisclosure about it.

Reuters reported that a Kaepernick rep had no comment.

It was nearly a decade ago when Kaepernick, then of the San Francisco 49ers, protested against racial injustice in the U.S. when he knelt during the national anthem before a preseason game. The demonstrated kickstarted a firestorm around the league, prompting NFL players and President Donald Trump to clash at one point.

Kaepernick protested throughout the 2016 season and left the 49ers before the start of the 2017 season. He has not played in the NFL since then. He filed a collusion lawsuit against the NFL, which was settled in 2019.

Ann Marie Lawrence, a Maryland mother and women's weight-loss coach, shares her quick-and-easy recipe for a one-pot Philly cheesesteak pasta dish that contains 32 grams of protein.

A frustrated man turned to Reddit after his pregnant sister kept eating his food without asking, leading to an outpouring of support.

In a post on the popular platform, the 30-year-old man shared that his 31-year-old sister had recently left her husband and moved in with him.

""I have a small apartment, but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she's six months pregnant,"" he wrote. ""I wasn't very pleased about this situation, but she is my sis, after all.""

At first, things were going fine – until his food started disappearing.

The man wrote that he has very specific foods for his fitness goals and that his sister has been eating these — including his expensive shakes, post-run snacks and meal preps.

When confronted about her eating habits, the sister responded by shrugging or blaming hormones.

""I asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. … She refuses to do anything about it,"" he said.

The brother (not pictured) said he portioned, labeled and planned his groceries each week to support his gym routine. (iStock)

When the man resorted to buying a small mini-fridge and putting it in his bedroom, the sister accused him of ""treating her like a thief.""

""I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights,"" he said.

""Now she's sulking and has told our parents, after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her.""

""Sibling relationships are often the hardest ones we ever deal with.""

The man sharing his story on Reddit also reported that his mother called him and said that ""pregnancy isn't easy,"" especially with his sister's situation.

""I don't think I'm being cruel … I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But at my expense?"" he concluded.

""Tell your mother to come get your sister, so she can be sure that your sister is being taken care of,"" another chimed in.

""Boundaries must be put in place with no apologies.""

California-based relationship expert Audrey Hope told Fox News Digital the central issue of the disagreement goes far beyond food.

The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Saturday it was adopting a no-tolerance policy for homeless encampments in support of the Trump administration's ""beautification"" efforts in Washington, D.C.

The previous encampment policy suggested homelessness should be ""rare, brief and non-recurring,"" according to the District of Columbia website.

It noted the protocol for cleaning public spaces was only triggered when a site presented a security, health or safety risk or if it interfered with community use. 

""With this in mind, we provide resources to shelter, pathways to housing and access to behavioral health services to individuals at these locations,"" officials wrote on the website.

TOP TRUMP OFFICIAL VOWS TO END 'CYCLE OF GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCY' IN HOMELESS CRACKDOWN

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday those living in homeless encampments will need to either accept treatment at a homeless shelter or go to jail if they refuse.

The U.S. Park Police have already removed 70 homeless encampments in D.C., with only a few remaining, Leavitt said. 

The remaining two sites were expected to be cleared this week by multi-agency teams, including the FBI, Secret Service and D.C. police.

Fifth-generation cattle rancher Steve Lucie discusses how tariffs affect the cattle industry on 'America Reports.'

The United States plans to breed thousands of sterile flies in a southern Texas factory in an effort to protect American cattle from flesh-eating maggots in Mexico.

The New World screwworm is a ""devastating pest,"" the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a news release this week. 

""When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal. NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people. It is not only a threat to our ranching community, but it is a threat to our food supply and our national security.""

Factory construction is expected to cost $750 million, and it would be located at Moore Air Force Base outside Edinburg, Texas, about 20 miles north of the border.

The USDA says sterile flies are ""currently the most effective way to prevent the spread of"" the maggots, adding it hopes to produce and release them into the wild within a year.

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the government also plans to spend $100 million on technology such as traps and lures, therapeutics, border patrols by ""tick riders"" mounted on horseback, dogs trained to sniff out the parasite and other tools that could ""bolster preparedness or response to NWS.""

Rollins added that the border will remain closed to cattle, horse and bison imports from Mexico until the parasite appears to be pushed back closer to Panama, where it had been contained until late last year through the breeding of sterile flies there. 

""Farm security is national security,"" Rollins said at a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week. ""All Americans should be concerned. But it's certainly Texas and our border and livestock-producing states that are on the front lines of this every day.""

The New World screwworm was a problem in the American cattle industry until it was largely eradicated in the 1970s through the breeding of sterile flies, and factories were shut down afterward.

Members of the class of 2026 have had access to AI since they were freshmen. Almost all of them are using it to do their work.

A college senior returning to classes this fall has spent nearly their entire undergraduate career under the shadow—or in the embrace—of generative AI. ChatGPT first launched in November 2022, when that student was a freshman. As a department chair at Washington University in St. Louis, I witnessed the chaos it unleashed on campus. Students weren't sure what AI could do, or which uses were appropriate. Faculty were blindsided by how effectively ChatGPT could write papers and do homework. College, it seemed to those of us who teach it, was about to be transformed.

But nobody thought it would happen this quickly. Three years later, the AI transformation is just about complete. By the spring of 2024, almost two-thirds of Harvard undergrads were drawing on the tool at least once a week. In a British survey of full-time undergraduates from December, 92 percent reported using AI in some fashion. Forty percent agreed that “content created by generative AI would get a good grade in my subject,” and nearly one in five admitted that they've tested that idea directly, by using AI to complete their assignments. Such numbers will only rise in the year ahead.

“I cannot think that in this day and age that there is a student who is not using it,” Vasilis Theoharakis, a strategic-marketing professor at the Cranfield School of Management who has done research on AI in the classroom, told me. That's what I'm seeing in the classes that I teach and hearing from the students at my school: The technology is no longer just a curiosity or a way to cheat; it is a habit, as ubiquitous on campus as eating processed foods or scrolling social media. In the coming fall semester, this new reality will be undeniable. Higher education has been changed forever in the span of a single undergraduate career.

“It can pretty much do everything,” says Harrison Lieber, a WashU senior majoring in economics and computer science (who took a class I taught on AI last term). As a college student, he told me, he has mostly inhabited a world with ChatGPT. For those in his position, the many moral questions that AI provokes—for example, whether it is exploitative, or anti-intellectual, or ecologically unsound—take a back seat to the simple truth of its utility. Lieber characterized the matter as pragmatic above all else: Students don't want to cheat; they certainly don't want to erode the value of an education that may be costing them or their family a small fortune. But if you have seven assignments due in five days, and AI could speed up the work by tenfold for the cost of a large pizza, what are you meant to do?

In spring 2023, I spoke with a WashU student whose paper had been flagged by one of the generally unreliable AI detectors that universities have used to stem the tide of cheating. He told me that he'd run his text through grammar-checking software and asked ChatGPT to improve some sentences, and that he'd done this to make time for other activities that he preferred. “Sometimes I want to play basketball,” he said. “Sometimes I want to work out.”

Read: The first year of AI college ends in ruin

His attitude might have been common among large-language-model users during that first, explosive year of AI college: If a computer helps me with my paper, then I'll have more time for other stuff. That appeal persists in 2025, but as these tools have taken over in the dorms, the motivations of their users have diversified. For Lieber, AI's allure seems more about the promise of achievement than efficiency. As with most students who are accepted to and graduate from an elite university, he and his classmates have been striving their whole life. As Lieber put it, if a course won't have “a tangible impact on my ability to get a good job,” then “it's not worth putting a lot of my time into.” This approach to education, coupled with a “dismal” outlook for postgraduate employment, justifies an ever more ferocious focus on accomplishment. Lieber is pursuing a minor in film and media studies. He has also started a profitable business while in school. Still, he had to network hard to land a good job after graduation. (He is working in risk management.)

Da'Juantay Wynter, another rising senior at WashU who has never seen a full semester without AI, told me he always writes his own essays but feels okay about using ChatGPT to summarize readings, especially if he is in a rush. And like the other students I spoke with, he's often in a rush. Wynter is a double major in educational studies and American-culture studies; he has also served as president of the Association of Black Students, and been a member of a student union and various other campus committees. Those roles sometimes feel more urgent than his classwork, he explained. If he does not attend to them, events won't take place. “I really want to polish up all my skills and intellect during college,” he said. Even as he knows that AI can't do the work as well, or in a way that will help him learn, “it's always in the back of my mind: Well, AI can get this done in five seconds.”

Another member of his class, Omar Abdelmoity, serves on the university's Academic Integrity Board, the body that adjudicates cases of cheating, with AI or otherwise. In almost every case of AI cheating he's seen, Abdelmoity told me, students really did have the time to write the paper in question—they just got stressed or preoccupied by other things, and turned to AI because it works and it is available. Students also feel the strain of soaring expectations. For those who want to go to medical school, as Abdelmoity does, even getting a 4.0 GPA and solid MCAT scores can seem insufficient for admission to the best programs. Whether or not this is realistic, students have internalized the message that they should be racking up more achievements and experience: putting in clinical hours, publishing research papers, and leading clubs, for example. In response, they seek ways to “time shift,” Abdelmoity said, so they can fit more in. And that's at an elite private university, he continued, where the pressure is high but so is the privilege. At a state school, a student might be more likely to work multiple jobs and take care of their family. Those ordinary demands may encourage AI use even more.

In the end, Abdelmoity said, academic-integrity boards such as the one he sits on can only do so much. For students who have access to AI, an education is what you make of it.

If the AI takeover of higher ed is nearly complete, plenty of professors are oblivious. It isn't that they fail to understand the nature of the threat to classroom practice. But my recent interviews with colleagues have led me to believe that, on the whole, faculty simply fail to grasp the immediacy of the problem. Many seem unaware of how utterly normal AI has become for students. For them, the coming year could provide a painful revelation.

Some professors I spoke with have been taking modest steps in self-defense: They're abandoning online and take-home assignments, hoping to retain the purity of their coursework. Kerri Tobin, an associate professor of education at Louisiana State University, told me that she is making undergrads do a lot more handwritten, in-class writing—a sentiment I heard many times this summer. The in-class exam, and its associated blue book, is also on the rise. And Abdelmoity reported that the grading in his natural-science courses has already been rejiggered, deemphasizing homework and making tests count for more. These adjustments might be helpful, but they also risk alienating students. Being forced to write out essays in longhand could make college feel even more old-fashioned than it did before, and less connected to contemporary life.

Other professors believe that moral appeals may still have teeth. Annabel Rothschild, an assistant professor of computer science at Bard College, said she's found that blanket rules and prohibitions have been less effective than a personal address and appeal to social responsibility. Rothschild is particularly concerned about the environmental harms of AI, and she reports that students have responded to discussions about those risks. The fact that she's a scientist who understands the technology gives her message greater credibility. It also helps that she teaches at a small college with a focus on the arts.

Today's seniors entered college at the tail end of the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis that once seemed likely to produce its own transformation of higher ed. The sudden switch to Zoom classes in 2020 revealed, over time, just how outmoded the standard lecture had become; it also showed that, if forced by circumstance, colleges could turn on a dime. But COVID led to little lasting change in the college classroom. Some of the students I spoke with said the response to AI has been meager too. They wondered why faculty weren't doing more to adjust teaching practices to match the fundamental changes wrought by new technologies—and potentially improve the learning experience in the process.

Lieber said that he wants to learn to make arguments and communicate complex ideas, as he does in his film minor. But he also wonders why more courses can't assess those skills through classroom discussion (which is hard to fake) instead of written essays or research papers (which may be completed with AI). “People go to a discussion-based class, and 80 percent of the class doesn't participate in discussion,” he said.

The truth is that many professors would like to make this change but simply can't. A lot of us might want to judge students on the merits of their participation in class, but we've been discouraged from doing so out of fear that such evaluations will be deemed arbitrary and inequitable—and that students and their parents might complain. When professors take class participation into account, they do so carefully: Students tend to be graded on whether they show up or on the number of times they speak in class, rather than the quality of what they say. Erin McGlothlin, the vice dean of undergraduate affairs in WashU's College of Arts & Sciences, told me this stems from the belief that grading rubrics should be crystal clear in spelling out how class discussion is evaluated.

For professors, this approach avoids the risk of any conflicts related to accommodating students' mental health or politics, or to bureaucratic matters. But it also makes the modern classroom more vulnerable to the incursion of AI. If what a student says in person can't be assessed rigorously, then what they type on their computer—perhaps with automated help—will matter all the more.

Like the other members of his class, Lieber did experience a bit of college life before ChatGPT appeared. Even then, he said, at the very start of his freshman year, he felt alienated from some of his introductory classes. “I would think to myself, What the hell am I doing, sitting watching this professor give the same lecture that he has given every year for the last 30 years?” But he knew the answer even then: He was there to subsidize that professor's research. At America's research universities, teaching is a secondary job activity, at times neglected by faculty who want to devote as much time as possible to writing grants, running labs, and publishing academic papers. The classroom experience was suffering even before AI came onto the scene.

Now professors face their own temptations from AI, which can enable them to get more work done, and faster, just as it does for students. I've heard from colleagues who admit to using AI-generated recommendation letters and course syllabi. Others clearly use AI to write up their research. And still more are eager to discuss the wholesome-seeming ways they have been putting the technology to use—by simulating interactions with historical authors, for example, or launching minors in applied AI.

But students seem to want a deeper sort of classroom innovation. They're not looking for gimmicks—such as courses that use AI only to make boring topics seem more current. Students like Lieber, who sees his college education as a means of setting himself up for his career, are demanding something more. Instead of being required to take tests and write in-class essays, they want to do more project-based learning—with assignments that “emulate the real world,” as Lieber put it.

But designing courses of this kind, which resist AI shortcuts, would require professors to undertake new and time-consuming labor themselves. That assignment comes at the worst possible time. Universities have been under systematic attack since President Donald Trump took office in January. Funding for research has been cut, canceled, disrupted, or stymied for months. Labs have laid off workers. Degree programs have cut doctoral admissions. Multi-center research projects have been put on hold. The “college experience” that Americans have pursued for generations may soon be over.

The existence of these stressors puts higher ed at greater risk from AI. Now professors find themselves with even more demands than they anticipated and fewer ways to get them done. The best, and perhaps the only, way out of AI's college takeover would be to embark on a redesign of classroom practice. But with so many other things to worry about, who has the time? In this way, professors face the same challenge as their students in the year ahead: A college education will be what they make of it too. At some point, everyone on campus will have to do the work.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The alternative to affirmative action is now under attack.

President Donald Trump's administration is scrutinizing higher education. Last week, the White House issued a memorandum requiring all universities receiving federal funds to submit admissions data on all applicants to the Department of Education. The goal is to enforce the 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action.

Days before the memo was released, Columbia and Brown agreed to share their admissions data with the administration, broken down by race, grade point average, and standardized test scores. The administration suspects that universities are using “racial proxies” to get around the ban on race-based admissions. The Department of Education is expected to build a database of the admissions data and make it available to parents and students.

Amid this increased federal scrutiny, an alternative idea from Richard Kahlenberg, director of the American Identity Project for the Progressive Policy Institute, is gaining attention. Kahlenberg, who testified in the Supreme Court cases against Harvard and UNC, advocates for class-based affirmative action instead of race-based admissions. He argues that this approach will yield more economically and racially equitable results.

Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Kahlenberg about how he contends with the consequences of helping gut race-based affirmative action, why he believes class-based affirmative action is the path forward, and if his own argument may come in the crosshairs of a Trump administration eager to stamp out all forms of affirmative action.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You're the director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute. I would take it to mean that you are a progressive.

It's complicated these days. I'm left of center. I think of myself more as liberal than progressive.

I ask because you testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the case Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College. This is the case that essentially gutted race-based affirmative action. It doesn't sound like a progressive, or even a left-of-center, position. What was going on? Explain what you were thinking.

I've long been a supporter of racial diversity in colleges. I think that's enormously important, but I've been troubled that elite colleges were racially integrated, but economically segregated.

I think there's a better way of creating racial diversity — a more liberal way, if you will — which is to give low-income and economically disadvantaged students of all races a leg up in the admissions process in order to create both racial and economic diversity.

What was the data that you looked at that led you to believe that? Were primarily wealthy Black and Hispanic students benefiting from affirmative action?

There'd been a number of studies over the years that had come to that conclusion, including from supporters of race-based affirmative action. Then, in the litigation, further evidence came out. At Harvard, 71 percent of the Black and Hispanic students came from the most socioeconomically privileged 20 percent of the Black and Hispanic population nationally.

Now, to be clear, the white and Asian students were even richer. But for the most part, this was not a program that was benefiting working-class and low-income students.

Alright, so the Supreme Court in 2023 hands down this decision that says, essentially, we're done with race-based affirmative action. Was there a difference in how progressives and conservatives interpreted the Supreme Court ruling?

Most mainstream conservatives have always said they were opposed to racial preferences, but of course, they were for economic affirmative action. But now we have some on the extreme, including the Trump administration, saying that economic affirmative action is also illegal if part of the rationale for the policy is seeking to increase racial diversity.

What do you make of that? That was your team once upon a time, right?

Well, I think it's troubling when people shift the goalposts. In a number of the Supreme Court concurring opinions in the case, conservatives said that economic affirmative action made a lot of sense. Justice [Neil] Gorsuch, for example, said if Harvard got rid of legacy preferences and instead gave economic affirmative action, that would be perfectly legal. And now some extremists are shifting their position and saying they're opposed to any kind of affirmative action.

Are you surprised by that shift?

I'm not surprised. I'm confident, however, that a majority of the US Supreme Court won't go that far. The Supreme Court, to some degree, looks to public opinion. Racial preferences were always unpopular. But economic affirmative action is broadly supported by the public.

The Supreme Court has had two cases come before it, subsequent to the  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision. One involved a challenge to class-based affirmative action at Thomas Jefferson High School in Northern Virginia, and the other involved an attack on a similar class-based affirmative action program at the Boston exam schools, like Boston Latin. In both cases, the Supreme Court said we're not gonna hear those cases over the vehement dissent of a couple of extremely conservative justices. So I'm fairly confident that the Supreme Court will not go down the path of striking down economic-based preferences.

What do you make of this move by the Trump administration to ask colleges for data? 

I'm of two minds about it. I do think transparency is good in higher education. These institutions are receiving lots of taxpayer money. We want to make sure they're following the Supreme Court ruling, which said you can't use race.

Having said that, I'm quite nervous about how the Trump administration will use the data, because if a college discloses the average SAT scores and grades by race of applicants, of those admitted, and then those enrolled, one of two things can be going on. One is that the university's cheating and they're using racial preferences, and that would be a violation of the law.

The other possibility is that they did shift to economic affirmative action, which is perfectly legal.

And because Black and Hispanic students are disproportionately low income and working class, they will disproportionately benefit from a class-based affirmative action program. And so the average SAT score is going to look somewhat lower. I'm worried that the Trump administration will go after both race-based and class-based affirmative action.

Because class-based affirmative action still might mean a college is admitting more Black and Hispanic students. And what the Trump administration seems to have the issue with is that fact.

Yes. Increasingly, that's what it looks like. As long as the Trump administration was focused on counting race and deciding who gets ahead, they had the American public on their side. But Americans also support the idea of racially integrated student bodies, they just don't like racial preferences as the means for getting there. So, if Trump says, no matter how you achieve this racial diversity, I'm just opposed to racial diversity, he'll have lost the public. And I don't think he will be consistent with the legal framework under Students for Fair Admissions, either.

Do you think he cares?

Well, I think he ought to care if he cares about the future of his political party. Because under class-based affirmative action, it is true that Black and Hispanic students will disproportionately benefit, but it will also benefit white working-class students. And those are the students who are coming from families that form the base of the Republican Party. So I think it would be a big mistake if the Trump administration were to really push hard on that angle.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the United States and European nations to give Ukraine ""Article 5-like protection"" as a security guarantee to bring an end to the war.

""We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article Five-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,"" Witkoff said Sunday on CNN.

It was ""the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that,"" he continued.

NATO's Article 5 says that ""if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday that she welcomed the security guarantees for Ukraine, and that the ""European Union ... is ready to do its share,"" according to the Associated Press.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it is ""a historic decision that the United States is ready to take part in security guarantees for Ukraine,"" according to a post on X.

""Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe's participation,"" he wrote.

Special envoy Witkoff's remarks come just days after President Donald Trump met in Alaska with Putin amid his country's ongoing war with Ukraine. Trump and his administration hailed the talks as ""productive,"" but details of the meeting have so far been scant.

Trump, in the lead-up to his meeting with Putin, repeatedly stressed the need for an urgent, long-lasting ceasefire in the war.

The talks did not yield such an agreement, sparking concern among officials in Ukraine and European nations that Trump was moving away from the goal.

In the days since the talks, Trump, however, has said that the ""best way"" to end the war is ""to go directly to a Peace Agreement.""

Witkoff said Sunday that Trump and Putin ""covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal"" during their hours-long meeting, without providing additional details.

""We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal,"" he said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Sunday that Russia will face ""additional consequences"" if Trump's effort to end the war ""doesn't work out,"" but warned against implementing additional sanctions.

""The minute you levy additional sanctions, strong additional sanctions, the talking stops,"" he said on ABC News.

Rubio added that ""we're still a long ways off"" from a peace agreement.

""We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remain some big areas of disagreement,"" he said. ""We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement, we're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made towards one.""

Trump is set to meet with Zelenskyy and European leaders on Monday.

If the Kremlin did in fact agree to security conditions for Ukraine similar to NATO's Article 5, it would be a stark departure from at least one of the Russian president's previous justifications for attacking the country.

Russia has said any resolution to the war would need to address the ""root causes of the conflict,"" most significantly Ukraine demilitarizing and abandoning its aspirations of joining NATO.

The Kremlin has also made clear it wants any peace deal to include international recognition of its annexation of Crimea and significant portions of eastern Ukraine.

Following Friday's summit, Trump said a peace deal could be reached if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the Donbas region, the New York Times reported, citing senior European officials.

But Zelenskyy has been adamant that Kyiv will never recognize any of its sovereign territory as part of Russia, even regions Moscow has already annexed. The Ukrainian president has said doing so would violate the country's Constitution. Ukraine has also said it wants any peace deal to include guarantees that Russia will never invade again.

""Everyone agrees that borders must not be changed by force,"" Zelenskyy wrote on X.

""Everyone supports that key issues must be resolved with Ukraine's participation in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the U.S., and the Russian chief.""

Rubio also said Sunday on NBC News that ""there has to be talk about what the territories are going to look like and what the border lines are going to look like at the end of this conflict.""

""There has to be talk about how Ukraine is rebuilt, and how do you rebuild a country that's been attacked as often as it has over the last three and a half years,"" he added.

With more families concerned about how they will afford college, some schools are offering an unbeatable deal.

While the total cost of college is nearing or crossing the $100,000 threshold at several institutions across the country, according to data provided by The Princeton Review, tuition is completely free for all students at handful of other colleges and universities in the U.S.

Although paying this tab is easy, getting in may not be. Each of these schools has high academic standards, experts say — and in return for a degree at no cost, the commitment they require, even after graduation, is steep.

""This is a self-selecting group in a lot of ways,"" said Robert Franek, editor in chief at The Princeton Review. Yet ""it gives some hope for parents who worry about making college affordable — these colleges are doing just that.""

For those up for the challenge, The Princeton Review compiled a list of the colleges that cost nothing. Here are the nine schools that don't charge tuition at all.

For over 150 years, this small school in Berea, Kentucky has strived to reach first-generation and low-income students who otherwise could not afford to pay for college, according to the school. But it doesn't stop there: Berea gives every student a laptop and funds to cover internship opportunities and even professional clothing for job interviews.

Dubbed ""Hard Work U,"" College of the Ozarks is a coed Christian school in rural Missouri geared toward serving students in the Ozark region. In return for a full scholarship, undergraduates must work 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks during the academic year as part of the school's work program.

Only 12 to 15 students are admitted each year to this all-male liberal arts college in California's remote High Desert, according to the school. However, every student is awarded a scholarship that covers tuition and room and board. Since Deep Springs is a two-year school with no majors, many graduates go on to transfer to four-year programs to complete a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree.

In addition to free tuition and room and board, students receive a stipend to cover all other costs at this academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado. In exchange, the academic and physical demands are rigorous, according to The Princeton Review, with classes from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. followed by fitness training multiple times a week. After four years, graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants in the Air Force or U.S. Space Force and commit to several years of active duty.

This New London, Connecticut-based academy is also highly selective and demanding, according to The Princeton Review. The extremely structured four-year program, which is fully paid for by the government, offers 10 academic majors, including civil engineering and marine science. After completing their schooling, students commit to five years of service, although many opt to stay in the Coast Guard for much longer, the academy says.

Tuition, room and board, uniforms and books are similarly covered at this service academy in Kings Point, New York. As part of the four-year program, cadets gain hands-on experience working aboard commercial and military vessels around the world. Once they graduate, midshipmen can enter any branch of the armed forces as an officer. The service obligation varies depending on what type of job they choose.

Every cadet at this prestigious institution in West Point, New York receives free tuition and a scholarship that covers room and board, in addition to a stipend for uniforms, books, supplies and all other expenses. Armed with a BS degree, West Point graduates then serve at least five years of active duty and three years in the reserves and are ""ready for a lifetime of service to the Army and nation,"" according to the academy.

All students on campus, known as ""the Yard,"" in Annapolis, Maryland, receive a full scholarship that covers tuition, room and board and other costs, in return for at least five years of active duty after graduation, followed by the reserves. After their rigorous training, many midshipmen go on to have prominent careers within and outside the military, according to The Princeton Review.

Founded by the shipbuilder William Webb, this small, private college in Glen Cove, New York specializes in naval architecture and marine engineering. Every student receives a full scholarship to cover tuition and, along with little to no debt, they benefit from a 100% job placement rate upon graduation, according to the school.

A scheduled visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi later this month has been called off, according to Indian news broadcaster NDTV Profit.

The visit that was expected to take place between Aug. 25 and Aug. 29 will likely be rescheduled, NDTV reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The report comes at a time when trade relations between the two countries have soured with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing a 25% blanket tariff on Indian exports, and topping those with additional 25% in duties — expected to come into effect on Aug. 27 — as a ""penalty"" for India purchasing Russian crude.

Both sides are in contact with each other, but a new schedule for talks has not been finalized, the report said.

Trump's cumulative 50% tariff rate on India is among the highest on any of the U.S.' trading partners, and has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi.

India has said it was being targeted unfairly, while calling out the EU and the U.S. on their continuing trade with Russia. ""It is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them],"" the country's foreign ministry said in a statement earlier this month.

India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Office of the U.S Trade Representative did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.

The U.S. is India's single largest export partner, with nearly 20% of its overall exports, or $86.51 billion worth of goods, shipped to the U.S. in fiscal year ended March 2025, according to the latest official data.

The Republican governors of three states are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., at the request of the administration of President Donald Trump, who has portrayed the city as awash in crime.

The announcements on Saturday of troops from hundreds of miles away in West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio came a day after D.C. officials and the Trump administration negotiated a deal to keep Mayor Muriel Bowser's appointed police chief, Pamela Smith, in charge of the police department after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit to block the federal takeover of the department.

Trump, a Republican, said this week he was deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops to Washington and temporarily taking over the Democratic-led city's police department to curb what he depicted as a crime and homelessness emergency.

Justice Department data, however, showed violent crime in 2024 hit a 30-year low in Washington, a self-governing federal district under the jurisdiction of Congress.

West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey's office said in a statement he was deploying 300 to 400 National Guard troops to D.C. in ""a show of commitment to public safety and regional cooperation."" The statement said he also was providing equipment and specialized training.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster responded to a Pentagon request by announcing that 200 of his state's National Guard troops would be sent.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police members in the coming days, adding none of them were ""currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state.""

After the announcements, Mayor Bowser posted on X: ""American soldiers and airmen policing American citizens on American soil is #UnAmerican.""

The National Guard serves as a militia that answers to the governors of the 50 states except when called into federal service. The D.C. National Guard reports directly to the president.

Trump, who has suggested he could take similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities, has sought to expand the powers of the presidency in his second term, inserting himself into the affairs of major banks, law firms and elite universities.

In June, Trump ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, against the wishes of California's Democratic governor, during protests over mass immigration raids by federal officials.

South Carolina's McMaster said his troops would immediately return to South Carolina if needed to respond to a possible hurricane or other natural disaster. Hurricane Erin, now northeast of Puerto Rico, has become a catastrophic Category 5 storm that could bring ocean swells to the U.S. East Coast early next week, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Saturday.

National Guard troops often respond to natural disasters and rarely police U.S. civilians.

Drew Galang, a spokesperson for West Virginia's Morrisey, said the state's National Guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to D.C. late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment.

A White House official said on Saturday that more National Guard troops would be called in to Washington to ""protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime.""

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a formal order was expected to go out that would authorize National Guard troops in D.C. to carry firearms. The official said this order would affect mostly military police officers with sidearms. Reuters has reported that the National Guard troops would have weapons nearby, such as in their vehicles.

The White House said on Saturday that D.C. National Guard members have conducted patrols on foot and in vehicles around the National Mall and Union Station. The White House said the National Guard troops are not making arrests now and that they may be armed.

It is not clear how the administration could deploy National Guard troops elsewhere. A federal judge in San Francisco is expected in the coming weeks to issue a ruling on whether Trump violated the law with the Los Angeles deployments.

The European Union is trying to prevent the United States from targeting the bloc's digital rules as both sides work through the final details of a delayed statement to formalize a trade deal reached last month, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

EU officials said disagreements over language relating to ""non-tariff barriers,"" which the U.S. said include the digital rules, are among the reasons for the hold-up of the statement, the newspaper said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The European Union, the White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The statement had originally been expected days after the July announcement by EU President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump, according to FT.

The July deal imposed a 15% import tariff on most EU goods — half the initially threatened rate — and helped avert a broader trade war between the two allies, who together account for nearly a third of global trade.

The U.S. wanted to keep the door open for possible concessions on the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on U.S. tech companies, according to FT, which added that the commission has said that relaxing these rules is a red line.

The EU's DSA is a landmark law meant to make the online environment safer and fairer by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

The commission had anticipated that Trump would sign an executive order by Aug. 15 to cut tariffs on EU car exports to the U.S. from 27.5% to 15%. However, a U.S. official signaled that this would be delayed until the joint statement was finalized, according to FT.

When Astronomer ex-CEO Andy Byron and the company's HR head were caught cuddling on a jumbotron during a concert, the moral condemnation was followed by a collective question: Why would they risk their families and careers for a tryst?

As an executive counsellor and couples' therapist, I often spend my days sitting across from clients who are contemplating or already involved in similar situations. Most are not abusers, narcissists, or sex addicts who engage in serial cheating. They are good people: hardworking, kind, and devoted to their careers and families.

So, what makes a person — even one who swears they would never cheat — suddenly cross the precipice and risk everything for an affair?

Humans are wired to want the approval of others, and as social beings, our survival often depends on it. We ""go with the flow,"" repressing our emotions to please those around us.

But like a spring that becomes more tightly wound with each passing year, this can quietly lay the groundwork for a violent recoil.

Here are five surprisingly common psychological pitfalls that can make someone risk everything for an affair.

Many of my clients who have engaged in extramarital affairs have always considered themselves to be ""good."" They listened to their parents, studied hard, landed a lucrative job, got married, had kids, and followed every societal expectation to the letter.

For them, love and acceptance in childhood were linked to achievement, and they often reach middle age without having a clear sense of who they really are. When an uneasy sense that ""something is missing"" inevitably starts to emerge, they sometimes turn to an affair in an attempt to fill the void.

It's no surprise that perfectionism is a trait I see in almost all of my high-performing clients. But perfectionism is often a response to trauma. Children in volatile environments or those given inconsistent approval often believe that doing everything perfectly will keep them safe.

Over time, they become weary of enforcing impossibly high standards on themselves and those around them. When an affair beckons, they may suddenly give up on trying to be perfect and double down in the opposite direction.

For them, an illicit relationship can feel like being set free from their own unrealistic expectations — a salve that softens the rigidity that has framed their lives.

People with weak boundaries often had parents who were somehow incapacitated — through addiction, poverty, feeling overwhelmed, or simple immaturity — and the role of providing emotional stability at home fell on their small shoulders.

Parentified children derive their sense of value from successfully anticipating and meeting the needs of others. But eventually, they start to feel resentful of the people they are ""helping.""

When an affair comes knocking, they rationalize it by telling themselves they have spent their entire lives giving to others, and now it is time to do something just for themselves.

As renowned couples' therapist Esther Perel points out in her book ""The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity,"" the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the relationship.

Some of my clients engage in affairs after enduring years of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse. A secret relationship can be an unexpected but welcome reprieve from decades of unkind treatment.

It can also be a subconscious form of retaliation, a decision to blow up the relationship once and for all in an attempt to save oneself. There is no turning back once an affair is exposed, and scorched earth offers them a chance to start afresh.

One of the first questions I ask clients who are contemplating an affair is whether they have recently lost someone or something close to them. Grief is a catalyst, and it is often the death of a parent that triggers a reassessment of current relationships and priorities.

During this period of re-evaluation, boundaries become more permeable, which sometimes allows a party outside of the marriage to gain access.

Nobel laureate Albert Schweitzer is quoted as having said: ""In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being.""

It is this intoxicating sense of emotional enlightenment that makes many feel an affair is worth risking everything they once valued. Their world view narrows until every aspect of their lives outside of the affair partner is diminished in their field of vision. It is only in retrospect that things settle back into their correct scale and the situation can be viewed objectively.

For some couples, an affair can trigger the demise of a marriage that had already run its course. For others, it can prompt self-reflection and a renegotiation of the union's terms, allowing them to emerge stronger and better than before.

Professionally, the consequences can be career-altering and irreversible.

Learning how to advocate for yourself before you reach any emotional breaking point is both a personal and professional superpower.

 Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg's bear market warning comes as other industry executives don't expect a sharper downturn for Bitcoin anytime soon. 

Bitcoin may have no more than 27% upside left in this cycle before entering a downtrend, according to Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg.

“I think there is a greater than 50% chance Bitcoin goes to the 140 to 150 range this year before we see another bear market next year,” McClurg said during a CNBC interview on Friday. At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $117,867, meaning a move into that range would represent gains of 19% to 27%, according to CoinMarketCap.

McClurg warned of a broader economic bear market ahead, saying he isn't confident in the macroeconomic outlook. 

“I don't like the economic standing at all right now,” he said, arguing that the US Federal Reserve should have already cut rates at its last two meetings. He expects rate cuts to come in both September and October. Similarly, market participants are pricing in a 92.5% chance of a Fed rate cut in September, according to the CME Watch Tool.

McClurg attributed the majority of Bitcoin's recent price action to spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows and treasury firm purchases. “That's what is really driving price,” he said.

“We're seeing large allocations coming in, not just from small institutions but from large sovereign wealth funds, we're seeing insurance companies asking questions,” he explained.

While McClurg expects treasury firm buying to reach a peak in the coming months, he acknowledged that their impact has been significant.

Other Bitcoin advocates disagree with the idea of another bear market. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor said during an interview on June 11 that “Winter is not coming back.”

“We're past that phase; if Bitcoin's not going to zero, it's going to $1 million,” Saylor said.

Meanwhile, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said he doesn't expect the bull market to slow down anytime soon.

“I bet 2026 is an up year,” Hougan said in an X video on July 26. “I broadly think we're in for a good few years,” Hougan added.

Bitcoin BTC$117,945.74 hovered near $118,348 on Sunday, up 0.39% in 24 hours, as two analysts outlined paths that could test traders' nerves: a dip toward $108K–$112K or a drawn-out range with room for altcoins.

Lark Davis argues that if bitcoin continues to slide, the most likely landing zone is $108,000–$112,000. That range served as a ceiling earlier this year when bitcoin's rally stalled, and in market psychology, levels that once blocked price often flip into support when revisited.

He emphasizes that this area also aligns with two classic pullback checkpoints known as the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements. These measures, drawn from the size of bitcoin's last rally, are widely watched because they often mark where profit-taking slows and new buying emerges. While Fibonacci ratios sound mathematical, in practice they work as self-fulfilling markers since many traders plan entries there.

Davis also points to the 20-week exponential moving average, a trend line that updates quickly with recent price action. When this line is rising into the same $108K–$112K area, it strengthens the case for support, because technical traders see both history and momentum meeting in one zone. 

When several signals cluster like this — resistance turned support, Fibonacci checkpoints and a rising average —traders call it “confluence,” and confluence zones often act like magnets for price tests.

In other words, Davis isn't predicting collapse but a healthy reset. His framework suggests that if bitcoin dips, buyers could step in around that band and fuel the next leg higher.

Michaël van de Poppe takes a different angle, noting that bitcoin was just rejected at a key resistance level near its recent highs. A rejection means sellers absorbed demand as the price tried to break out, a common signal that momentum needs to cool off before the next push. He expects the market to consolidate rather than trend, with bitcoin moving sideways between a floor and a ceiling while leverage resets.

The TradingView chart he shared underscores this. It showed bitcoin making repeated attempts at the top of its range but failing to hold above resistance. The candles formed wicks —price spikes that quickly faded — suggesting selling pressure was active near the highs. Underneath, the chart marked a zone of potential support, where Van de Poppe believes bitcoin could find a base before another breakout attempt.

For van de Poppe, the message is not about deep retracement but time. A sideways range would give the market breathing room, clear out overextended positions, and set the stage for the next move up. It would also open the door to rotation into altcoins, which often outperform when bitcoin stops trending.

That rotation, he suggests, could already be brewing. Once bitcoin stabilizes, traders typically seek higher returns in large altcoins like ether before spreading to smaller tokens. Altcoin rallies rarely start while bitcoin is in freefall, but they often gain momentum when BTC ranges and volatility cools.

In plain terms, the two analysts are describing different but compatible playbooks. Davis favors a deeper pullback into a support cluster that could refresh the uptrend, while van de Poppe sees a range-bound pause with potential for altcoins to shine.

For everyday readers, the checklist is simple: watch whether bitcoin trades sideways or dips to the $108K–$112K zone. In either case, analysts agree the broader bull market framework remains intact, but the path forward could look very different depending on how support and resistance play out in the weeks ahead.

Bitcoin's scarcity, with a hard cap of 21 million units, is what makes it a special asset. 

The digital asset's supply is enforced by a pre-determined halving schedule. 

Because of the burgeoning federal debt and money supply, Bitcoin's price should keep rising.  

It's impossible to argue with Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) performance. Over the past five- and 10-year periods, its price has soared 942% and 47,330%, respectively (as of Aug. 14). The gains have continued more recently, as the cryptocurrency's price is up 104% just in the last 12 months. 

Bitcoin now trades close to its record price. After such a monumental historical rise, investors are probably wondering if it's smart to buy this top digital asset. In my opinion, it's easy to remain bullish. Here's one must-know reason why now is the time to buy Bitcoin. 

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Image source: Getty Images.

The top reason to buy Bitcoin now is because this leading cryptocurrency has a fixed supply cap. There will only ever be 21 million units in circulation. Right now, there are 19.9 million Bitcoin units out there. The growth in supply is pre-determined by a halving event that occurs approximately every four years. Unless the majority of nodes agree to change the rules, Bitcoin's hard cap isn't going to change. 

Owning a scarce asset makes financial sense in its own right. However, when viewed next to the state of the current monetary system, the allure is strikingly clear. 

The U.S. carries an alarming $37 trillion in federal debt. This figure, and the money supply, have skyrocketed in the past 15 years thanks to unprecedented levels of stimulus. To get out of the Great Recession, and more recently to boost the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic, the government pumps more money into the system. Even in seemingly solid economic times, the debt and money supply expand.

More fiat currency chasing a fixed amount of Bitcoin supports a much higher price for the digital asset years and decades from now. 

Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $668,155!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $1,106,071!*

Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 1,070% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.

Oops, something went wrong

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

A viral Reddit discussion has reignited the debate over generational wealth-building strategies, with younger investors increasingly viewing Bitcoin as their answer to the housing crisis that has priced many out of homeownership.

The central thesis gaining traction among millennials and Gen Z investors is straightforward: while Baby Boomers benefited from purchasing homes at dramatically lower prices decades ago, today's younger generations face a different opportunity in the form of digital assets.

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to Federal Reserve data, the median home price in 1980 was approximately $47,200, while median household income was $17,710. Today, that same home costs over $400,000, while median income has grown to roughly $70,000—creating a far less favorable price-to-income ratio.

“You can't live in a Bitcoin,” critics often argue, highlighting the fundamental difference between a home as shelter and cryptocurrency as a speculative investment. However, Bitcoin advocates counter that traditional real estate comes with hidden costs: property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and what they call “entropic decay”—the inevitable deterioration of physical assets.

Proponents argue Bitcoin offers several advantages over traditional real estate investment:

Global Accessibility: Unlike real estate, Bitcoin can be purchased and held anywhere in the world without geographical constraints or minimum investment thresholds.

No Maintenance Costs: Digital assets don't require property management, repairs, or dealing with tenants.

Liquidity: Bitcoin can be sold instantly, unlike real estate transactions that can take months.

Portability: Cryptocurrency holdings can move with the owner, unaffected by local market conditions or political instability.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Despite Bitcoin's recent surge past $100,000, skeptics question whether the cryptocurrency is still “cheap” relative to its risk profile. The asset's notorious volatility means investors must stomach potential 50-80% drawdowns during bear markets—a psychological challenge that many underestimate.

Financial advisor perspectives vary widely. Some view Bitcoin as portfolio diversification, recommending allocations of 1-5% of total assets. Others warn against treating cryptocurrency as a primary wealth-building strategy, emphasizing the importance of emergency funds, retirement savings, and traditional investments.

The discussion reveals deeper frustrations with monetary policy and economic systems. Many participants blame Federal Reserve policies and fractional reserve banking for inflating asset prices beyond the reach of average earners, rather than targeting specific generations.

“The real enemy isn't Boomers—it's the system that debases currency and inflates assets,” one commenter noted, highlighting how monetary expansion benefits asset holders while disadvantaging new entrants to the market.

For those considering Bitcoin as a wealth-building strategy, experts recommend:

Only investing what you can afford to lose

Understanding the technology and market dynamics

Using secure storage methods like hardware wallets

Viewing Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, not a complete strategy

Preparing for significant volatility and extended bear markets

The fundamental question remains: Is Bitcoin the great equalizer for younger generations, or simply another speculative bubble that could leave investors worse off than when they started?

As traditional pathways to wealth become increasingly difficult to access, the answer may determine the financial future of an entire generation.

Can Ethereum tame the bull? This is a question that haunts more than one investor. Because behind its recent surge lies a very real but equally fragile shift. The market's second-largest crypto has delivered performances up to the point of nudging its all-time high. And yet… despite the enthusiasm, subtle but strong signs suggest a possible calm. Could the bull be tired?

This rise in power is not going unnoticed: the ETH/BTC ratio of crypto ETFs has tripled in three months, according to CryptoQuant. Translation: institutional investors, who still favored bitcoin, now seem to bet more strongly on Ethereum. In August, this ratio increased from 0.05 to 0.15, indicating a massive allocation shift within portfolios.

Another strong clue: Ethereum recently reached $4,743, its highest since 2021, nearing its all-time record. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC price ratio crossed its 365-day moving average – an indicator which, historically, signals phases of outperformance for ether.

Trading volumes do not lie either: for four weeks, the weekly spot volume of ETH has exceeded that of BTC. Latest figures: $24 billion versus $14 billion, according to CryptoQuant.

This growth is explained by a combination of factors: increased demand via ETFs, long-term investors rebalancing their positions, and a market sentiment leaning towards Ethereum use cases – staking, DeFi, tokenization.

Behind the encouraging numbers, some signals call for caution. Still according to CryptoQuant, ETH inflows to exchanges recently exceeded those of bitcoin. This suggests some holders are considering taking profits especially after such a rapid rise.

Another discreet alert: the ETH/BTC MVRV ratio rose from 0.4 to 0.8 between May and August, approaching the 0.9 threshold. For analysts, this level often indicates relative overvaluation of ether – a zone where reversals are common.

Add to this a surge in activity on ETH perpetual futures contracts, with open interest growing faster than bitcoin's. Interest is there, yes, but the higher it climbs, the greater the risk of a domino effect if profits are taken.

In short, Ethereum leads the dance… but the music might slow down. ETFs support the rise, but strong hands remain cautious about a potential consolidation.

To better grasp this moving dynamic, here are some key landmarks:

Ethereum enters a new era. Although the market sometimes wavers, signals converge: it is indeed the ETF and 401(k)-style retirement savings combination that could sustainably transform this network. No longer a mere altcoin, but a central infrastructure of tomorrow's crypto economy.

Does Circle's Arc threaten Ethereum's “stablecoin chain” moat, or does EVM gravity pull flows back anyway?

Informal co-founder Ethan Buchman | Permissionless II by Blockworks

Circle is building its own blockchain — and it's not a rollup, but a layer-1.

In doing so, the American stablecoin issuer is betting that the shortest path between a dollar and a smart contract is the one it controls — full-stack, sovereign, and custom-built for payments.

The new chain, dubbed Arc, will be Ethereum-compatible, but use USDC for gas, and feature sub-second deterministic finality. 

The big question for Ethereum is whether Arc will shift stablecoin activity or function more like a hub-and-spoke architecture, internalizing issuance and settlement while routing liquidity and flow outward to the broader EVM ecosystem via CCTP and other bridges.

The decision to build a new sovereign chain — rather than deploying on a modular layer 2 — has reignited a familiar argument on Crypto Twitter: does this mark a return to enterprise chains, or is it simply the logical architecture for a dollar-native payments platform? Does it weaken Ethereum's long-held role as crypto's settlement layer for stablecoins, or further entrench it through cross-chain interoperability and network effects?

The answers may hinge less on ideology than execution, and whether Circle pursues Arc as a walled garden or merely a better bank.

Circle declined to comment on Arc's technical design, citing a quiet period. But what we know from the published light paper is that the L1 is built on Malachite, a new high-performance BFT consensus engine originally developed by Informal Systems as a rewrite of Tendermint. Circle has hired the core team of nine behind Malachite, but the engine remains open-source and is already being used elsewhere, including in Starknet's decentralization roadmap.

Informal co-founder Ethan Buchman told Blockworks he views Malachite as akin to the Rust language: “Originally developed at Mozilla, now used by everyone.”

For Buchman, Circle's decision to launch its own chain is not a rejection of Ethereum, but a standard business choice for a team with sufficient resources. “It's the same decision every time when people choose to build their own chain: they value vertical integration,” Buchman said.

“The kind of predictability that gives you, and how it sort of hedges uncertainty — because you have the stack, you have the team, you're not dependent on some external team for core components,” he said.

Crypto Twitter/X is split on the net-impact. The bullish-ETH read (Ryan Sean Adams, Armani Ferrante) says EVM-first corporate chains still feed Ethereum's network effects. The bearish-ETH camp (Jon Charbonneau) argues the marginal EVM developer now accrues close to zero to ETH if flows internalize elsewhere. 

Others worry about censorship and developer gravity: Eli Ben-Sasson fired a warning shot — “Corporate L1s / L2s won't succeed” — against more open systems, while Adam Cochran tried to disqualify Arc as “a consortium chain” rather than an L1.

The counter-narrative from operators is that deterministic finality and protocol-level controls are critical for payments and FX. Arc's paper leans into that: “A transaction on Arc is either unconfirmed or it is 100% final and irreversible.” 

This is the crux of L1 over L2 as a business decision. Rollups “rent” Ethereum's finality and data availability; sovereign L1s own the base-layer policy surface, including gas denomination, KYC hooks, dispute/refund logic, and transaction ordering.

Circle will start with what amounts to a Cosmos chain using Proof-of-Authority, with a closed validator set. “It's very cheap to operate,” Interchain Labs co-founder Barry Plunkett told Blockworks. 

For instance, 5-10 Cosmos validator costs on the order of a few thousand dollars a month. “Maybe an L2 is a little cheaper because you don't need as many boxes and don't have the overhead of paying third parties to operate them for you. But you do have DA costs, so it's probably a wash,” Plunkett said.

If your profit margin lives on settlement economics and working-capital velocity, sovereignty is attractive. If your priority is time-to-market and broad composability, a centralized-sequencer rollup may be cheaper and easier to ship.

A Keyrock/Bitso report out today argues stablecoins are already reshaping the payments landscape. Monthly stablecoin payments more than tripled to $6.3 billion by February 2025, with B2B volumes jumping from $120 million to $2.7 billion in two years; card-based flows crossed $1 billion/month. On their trajectory, annual stablecoin payment volume could approach $1 trillion by 2030. 

That helps explain why companies with distribution are eyeing sovereign rails, according to Alchemy CTO Guillaume Poncin, formerly Stripe's engineering head.

“We are seeing several companies race to build a stablecoin-first blockchain,” Poncin told Blockworks. “The revenue opportunity from owning the settlement layer will dwarf traditional payment processing margins.” The infrastructure costs are tiny by comparison.

Poncin similarly frames L1 vs. L2 analysis as boiling down to a question of control vs time-to-market. “Choosing between the two is a nuanced trade-off… L1s can be fully customized at every layer, [but] rollups are battle-tested and much easier to build and secure.” He's not too concerned with fragmentation due to Arc's EVM compatibility, because it “speeds adoption by both developers and users.”

As crypto-native builders chase composability and yield, Circle is playing a different game: infrastructure that can compete with payments giants like Visa and Stripe, or even FedNow.

Critics have framed Arc as a sign that Circle, whose USDC accounts for nearly 30% of stablecoin supply on Ethereum, is pulling away from the chain that bootstrapped it.

But that overstates the case, according to Buchman.

“I think Ethereum is here for the long term, no matter what decision Circle makes today. I think it, it has achieved a kind of breakout velocity, it's entrenched itself as a technology of fundamental import to human rights… Its longevity will be related to its neutrality and its conservatism.”

Circle will continue to have to grapple with that. Past concerns over the influence of the USDC issuer over Ethereum's direction have been muted by the proliferation of competing stablecoin issuers, in Buchman's view.

“This is part of Ethereum's evolution and the idea that Ethereum only works if all compute happens on Ethereum, I think, is obscene and just it kind of misses the fundamental role Ethereum is going to have over the next 100 years or so,” Buchman said.

Ethereum's centrality as a destination for stablecoin flows can persist even as issuance and FX trading move upstream to Arc. We don't yet know the extent to which Circle will court DeFi apps to deploy on Arc, but in general, the application layer still wants to live where liquidity is deepest.

One legitimate concern is whether Arc's USDC-native design introduces new vectors for censorship or exclusion, especially in sanctioned jurisdictions. If USDC is both asset and gas, what happens when the token itself is frozen?

“Technically, fallback mechanisms are possible,” Buchman said, but the baseline should be the current banking system and he thinks Arc will certainly clear that low bar.

“Is it going to be as freedom-supporting and protective of human rights as Ethereum and Bitcoin themselves? No. I don't think anyone's trying to kid themselves about it. But I feel like Circle is trying to go to bat for an open economy.”

There remain open questions about system-level privacy and regulatory constraints, which Circle has only lightly touched on. “We pitched them hard on privacy,” Buchman added.

“They've acknowledged it, but we'll see how far they take it,” he said. “Malachite is well-suited to support privacy-preserving chains, and that's going to be a critical next step.”

Whether it will ultimately be a handful of new chains or a Cambrian explosion, it's clear that some enterprises still prefer building sovereign chains, even in the era of modular, shared security stacks. The tradeoffs between customization, governance, cost, and platform risk are nuanced, whether it's Robinhood's rollup on Arbitrum Orbit or Arc's full L1, or whatever Stripe has in store its newly announced L1 Tempo.

“I see it a lot like cloud versus on-prem[esis],” Buchman said. “Right now there's this whole movement to move things out of the cloud back to on-prem and it's going to oscillate back and forth until the end of time — and I think we'll see something similar with L1s and L2s.”

Ethereum price today is around $4,550, drawing attention as whales and institutional investors steadily accumulate large amounts of ETH, fueling optimism for a potential surge toward $15K.

This bullish sentiment comes at a time when institutional demand, ETF inflows, and Layer 2 adoption are reshaping Ethereum's market outlook. Analysts now believe Ethereum's combination of deflationary supply and whale accumulation could set the stage for one of its strongest rallies yet.

Ethereum price today remains under close watch as whales and institutions quietly accumulate massive amounts of ETH. Analysts suggest this buying pressure could be the catalyst for a significant rally, with projections ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 in the coming months.

Tom Lee, Managing Partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, made waves by forecasting Ethereum could “reach $15,000 by December,” highlighting the coin's strengthening role in institutional portfolios. His call comes as both retail and corporate investors look for the next big move in crypto markets.

Whale activity has intensified in recent weeks. According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one address believed to be linked to DeFiance Capital purchased 30,366 ETH worth $114 million in just 28 hours. This comes on top of significant institutional allocations such as BitMine Immersion Technology's purchase of over 106,000 ETH, valued at more than $470 million.

“The conviction of whales in current market conditions signals long-term confidence in Ethereum,” analysts at AMBCrypto noted. Despite volatility in spot trading, accumulation continues at scale, suggesting that smart money is positioning ahead of a breakout.

Fresh inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have also boosted optimism. CoinGlass data shows weekly inflows of $2.85 billion, marking one of the largest on record. Analysts point to ETFs as a key bridge for traditional investors entering the ETH market.

Meanwhile, the Layer 2 ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync continue to report rising transaction volumes and total value locked (TVL). This growth not only relieves pressure on Ethereum gas fees but also strengthens ETH's long-term utility and adoption narrative.

Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) transition has created a deflationary token model. More ETH is being locked in validator contracts, reducing circulating supply. At the same time, staking rewards have incentivized long-term holding.

As Standard Chartered noted in its recent report, “Ethereum's deflationary mechanism combined with institutional demand provides a unique setup for sustained price growth.” The bank has set a medium-term target of $7,500 but sees potential for $12,000–$15,000 if adoption trends continue.

From a technical perspective, Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates building momentum, though not yet at overbought levels. Futures markets tell a similar story: while the spot market has seen consistent selling, leveraged long positions are rising sharply.

CryptoQuant's futures volume data suggests whales are preparing for a potential squeeze. Futures leverage is climbing while spot selling continues, creating conditions for a sharp upward move once supply begins to thin.

The corporate sector is also leaning into Ethereum. Companies such as SharpLink and BitMine Immersion Technology have issued stock sales worth billions of dollars to build ETH treasuries.

This move reflects Ethereum's growing status not just as a decentralized finance (DeFi) asset but also as a strategic treasury reserve.

The convergence of whale accumulation, ETF inflows, deflationary tokenomics, and Layer 2 expansion provides strong bullish momentum for Ethereum. While some forecasts point to $10,000–$12,000 in the short term, more aggressive predictions, like Tom Lee's $15,000 year-end target, highlight the growing optimism surrounding ETH.

Still, market risks remain. Spot traders continue to sell into strength, and regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. could weigh on sentiment. Yet, with smart money signaling confidence and corporate adoption accelerating, Ethereum's path to a new all-time high appears increasingly within reach.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH Eyeing $6,600 As Institutions Buy The Dip, This ERC-20 Token Has Its Sights On 65x Growth","https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-3-1045893-20250817","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:13:30 GMT","

Ethereum Price Prediction is under the limelight as ETH trades at $4,415.95, decreasing by 1.08% at the time of writing. Despite this short-term decline, institutions are buying in big time and there is still long-term optimism for a drive towards $6,600, say analysts. In the meantime, fresh interest shifts to Remittix (RTX), an all-new ERC-20 token with real-world payment use case, which trades at $0.0944.

Ethereum has continued to withstand the unpredictable trading conditions. ETH continues to be the dominant smart contract platform with a market cap of $533.02 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $42.82 billion (down 24.56%). Institutional investors are apparently buying on a wide scale, pointing to confidence in the next leg of growth.

This institutional action continues to bolster the Ethereum Price Prediction, whereby a move above $6,000 can clear the path for new all-time highs. As institutions scoop up ETH, attention is also turning to upstart ERC-20 tokens like Remittix that combine blockchain innovation with real-world application.

Remittix (RTX) is a low gas fee cryptocurrency project designed for cross-border payments with ease. Unlike speculative tokens, it enables direct crypto-to-fiat payment to bank accounts in 30+ nations, targeting a $190 trillion payments market globally.

Momentum is already gathering, with over 603 million tokens sold and over $19.9 million raised. As soon as the presale exceeds $20 million, the team will be announcing its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, a huge milestone for liquidity and ease of access.

The project has also announced the beta wallet launch for Q3 2025, including real-time FX conversion, multi-crypto support and easy onboarding for freelancers and businesses. Investors now have a 40% token bonus and the chance to participate in a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway  incentivizing early adoption.

Remittix isn't another presale hype,  it's a cross-chain DeFi project solving a real-world payments problem. With low fees, fast transactions and mainstream use case, RTX is poised to be one of the best crypto presales of 2025.

For those investors tracking the Ethereum Price Prediction and searching for the next big altcoin of 2025, Remittix offers a rare combination of tech, adoption potential and early-stage growth. While institutions drive ETH's ascent, Remittix could be one of the top crypto under $1 that gets quietly positioned for mass adoption.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin (BTC) Forecast: Price Could Drop to $108K–$112K, Warns Crypto Analyst Lark Davis","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/17/bitcoin-steadies-at-usd118k-as-analysts-flag-deeper-pullback-risks-and-altcoin-rotation","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 16:42:48 GMT","

Bitcoin BTC$117,945.74 hovered near $118,348 on Sunday, up 0.39% in 24 hours, as two analysts outlined paths that could test traders' nerves: a dip toward $108K–$112K or a drawn-out range with room for altcoins.

Lark Davis argues that if bitcoin continues to slide, the most likely landing zone is $108,000–$112,000. That range served as a ceiling earlier this year when bitcoin's rally stalled, and in market psychology, levels that once blocked price often flip into support when revisited.

He emphasizes that this area also aligns with two classic pullback checkpoints known as the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements. These measures, drawn from the size of bitcoin's last rally, are widely watched because they often mark where profit-taking slows and new buying emerges. While Fibonacci ratios sound mathematical, in practice they work as self-fulfilling markers since many traders plan entries there.

Davis also points to the 20-week exponential moving average, a trend line that updates quickly with recent price action. When this line is rising into the same $108K–$112K area, it strengthens the case for support, because technical traders see both history and momentum meeting in one zone. 

When several signals cluster like this — resistance turned support, Fibonacci checkpoints and a rising average —traders call it “confluence,” and confluence zones often act like magnets for price tests.

In other words, Davis isn't predicting collapse but a healthy reset. His framework suggests that if bitcoin dips, buyers could step in around that band and fuel the next leg higher.

Michaël van de Poppe takes a different angle, noting that bitcoin was just rejected at a key resistance level near its recent highs. A rejection means sellers absorbed demand as the price tried to break out, a common signal that momentum needs to cool off before the next push. He expects the market to consolidate rather than trend, with bitcoin moving sideways between a floor and a ceiling while leverage resets.

The TradingView chart he shared underscores this. It showed bitcoin making repeated attempts at the top of its range but failing to hold above resistance. The candles formed wicks —price spikes that quickly faded — suggesting selling pressure was active near the highs. Underneath, the chart marked a zone of potential support, where Van de Poppe believes bitcoin could find a base before another breakout attempt.

For van de Poppe, the message is not about deep retracement but time. A sideways range would give the market breathing room, clear out overextended positions, and set the stage for the next move up. It would also open the door to rotation into altcoins, which often outperform when bitcoin stops trending.

That rotation, he suggests, could already be brewing. Once bitcoin stabilizes, traders typically seek higher returns in large altcoins like ether before spreading to smaller tokens. Altcoin rallies rarely start while bitcoin is in freefall, but they often gain momentum when BTC ranges and volatility cools.

In plain terms, the two analysts are describing different but compatible playbooks. Davis favors a deeper pullback into a support cluster that could refresh the uptrend, while van de Poppe sees a range-bound pause with potential for altcoins to shine.

For everyday readers, the checklist is simple: watch whether bitcoin trades sideways or dips to the $108K–$112K zone. In either case, analysts agree the broader bull market framework remains intact, but the path forward could look very different depending on how support and resistance play out in the weeks ahead.

Is this the start of an altseason, or just another false alarm?



Altcoin liquidations have overtaken Bitcoin on Binance in 2025. While signs point to an incoming altseason, key indicators show the market is still in transition and awaiting full confirmation.

Speculative trading is heating up!

Altcoins have officially overtaken Bitcoin [BTC] in total liquidations on Binance [BNB] in 2025. With many traders betting that altseason will kick off in August, leverage is piling into volatile tokens.



Even Ethereum [ETH] whales are making hasty exits — one dumped stETH at a $50,000 loss amid a $3.96 billion unstaking queue.

In a sharp shift from 2024, altcoins are now seeing more liquidations than Bitcoin on Binance.

Source: CryptoQuant

A recent CryptoQuant report showed that since early 2025, the cumulative liquidation delta has flipped in favor of altcoins.

The trend accelerated in July. Both long and short positions are getting wiped out, so traders are overleveraging in hopes of catching big moves.

Source: CryptoQuant

As liquidations rise, so does market activity. Binance, being the largest crypto exchange, has a big role to play in the altcoin speculation wave.

Simply put, altcoins have become the main playground for traders chasing the next big rally.

Several indicators suggest that altseason could be brewing in August 2025, but it's not a done deal yet.

The altcoins market cap has broken out of a downtrend for the third time in two years, with past breakouts historically leading to 150x and 175x rallies.

The latest breakout hints at a potential 200x move, showing optimism and bullish sentiment across altcoins.

Meanwhile, CoinGlass' Altcoin Season Index stood at 53 at press time. This is above the neutral 50 mark, but not yet in full-blown altseason territory (typically considered above 75).

Altcoins are beginning to outperform Bitcoin, but the trend needs confirmation.

Reinforcing this is Bitcoin's dominance chart, which continues to fall, now sitting at 59.49%.

The market remains in transition. A confirmed altseason may require a continued drop in BTC dominance and a sharper surge in retail-driven altcoin inflows.

A closely followed trader known for calling the market cycle top in 2021 says that a sizeable rally to much higher prices is still technically conservative for Bitcoin (BTC).

The pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave tells his 153,000 X followers that he's watching for a “conservative” Bitcoin price target above $150,000.

According to the analyst, BTC is currently travelling upward inside a large ascending channel, the upper bound of which suggests that the price target could be met by November this year.

Says Dave the Wave,

“BTC conservative technical target of $170,000.

In a manic, overheated market, [BTC] could go higher.”

The trader is also bullish on altcoins, recently noting an emerging weakness in the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart. Bitcoin dominance keeps track of how much of the crypto market belongs to BTC, and is often used as a gauge of altcoin strength.

Dave the Wave says BTC.D appears to be topping, which has historically coincided with altcoin upswings. He's targeting roughly the 42.5% area for BTC.D.

A downtrending BTC.D chart suggests that altcoins are rising in value faster than Bitcoin.

“BTC dom. Take your positions, ladies and gentlemen…”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,785, up over 101% in the last year, while BTC.D is hovering at 59.50%.

Every day, there seems to be a new blockchain for stablecoins.

Or at least that's how it felt this week, when USDC (USDC) issuer Circle announced Arc, its own settlement network, shortly after payments giant Stripe accidentally revealed Tempo, built in collaboration with Paradigm.

They were the latest in a growing list. Startups Plasma and Stable both raised funds recently to develop dedicated chains for USDT (USDT), the $160 billion and largest stablecoin on the market.

Tokenization players are piling in, too. 

Securitize is building Converge with Ethena, Ondo Finance announced its upcoming in-house chain earlier this year, and, just days ago, Dinari said it will soon launch an Avalanche-powered layer-1 network for clearing and settling tokenized stocks.

Stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets are rapidly growing segments of the crypto economy, and analysts project them to swell into trillion-dollar asset classes in the not too distant future. Stablecoins are poised to disrupt cross-border payments, while tokenization allows traditional instruments like bonds, funds and stocks trade around-the clock with faster settlements on blockchain rails, proponents say.

Today, the vast majority of these tokens live and settle on public blockchains like Ethereum, Solana or Tron. These neutral networks give issuers global reach and liquidity, but they also come with certain constraints for asset issuers.

""Building their own L1 is about control and strategic positioning, not just technology,"" said Martin Burgherr, chief clients officer at crypto bank Sygnum. 

Stablecoin economics are shaped by settlement speed, interoperability, and regulatory alignment, so ""owning the base layer"" lets firms directly embed compliance, integrate foreign exchange engine and ensure predictable fees, he said.

There's also a defensive motive. ""Today, stablecoin issuers depend on Ethereum, Tron or others for settlement,"" Burgherr said. ""That reliance means exposure to external fee markets, protocol governance decisions, and technical bottlenecks.""

Custom chains allow companies to issue their own gas tokens, control transaction costs and keep network performance isolated from unrelated activity that may clog the network, said Morgan Krupetsky, VP of ecosystem growth at Ava Labs.

Increasingly, she said, blockchains are becoming the ""middle and back office"" of a company's operations, powering transactions behind the scenes while user-facing apps may live across multiple chains.

“The idea of a company owning and customizing their end-to-end blockchain infrastructure is increasingly appealing,” she said.

The economics can be even more compelling than the tech. ""The revenue opportunity from owning the settlement layer will dwarf traditional payment processing margins, said Guillaume Poncin, chief technology officer at web3 development platform Alchemy.

He said that the new chains can offer additional control and the ability to implement know-your-customer (KYC) checks and other innovations at the protocol level. While L1s can offer full customization, rollups are faster to deploy and secure. 

In either case, Poncin noted, compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it far easier to integrate with other blockchains and speed adoption.

It's way too early to tell how the new chains will impact the incumbents, but some networks may feel the competition sooner than others, analysts said.

Coinbase analysts led by David Duong argued in a Friday report that Circle's Arc and Stripe's Tempo are targeting high-throughput, low-fee payments, which is Solana's (SOL) sweet spot. Meanwhile, Ethereum with its institution-heavy user base is less likely to be disrupted in the near term, they wrote.

The process for the entrants to win over users could take years, Sygnum's Burgherr said.

""New entrants will need not just technology, but also years of trust-building to shift the deepest liquidity and highest-value payments away from incumbent rails,"" he said. ""Financial institutions prize proven security, custody integration, and resilience under real-world stress.""

""That's why Ethereum remains the institutional ‘Fort Knox,'"" he said.

- Crypto bridges enable cross-chain interoperability by transferring assets and data between blockchains using wrapped tokens.

- They operate via trust-based custodians or trustless smart contracts, with security risks highlighted by the $600M Ronin Bridge hack.

- Major bridges like Stargate and Wormhole facilitate transfers across ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and TRON while balancing speed, security, and decentralization.

- Users must evaluate bridge mechanics and risks, as these tools drive blockchain innovation but remain vulnerable to operational and technical flaws.

Crypto bridges are emerging as a pivotal innovation in the blockchain space, enabling interoperability between disparate ecosystems. These bridges allow users to transfer assets and data across different blockchains, effectively breaking down silos that have historically limited cross-chain communication. By creating artificial derivatives of native assets—known as wrapped tokens—crypto bridges allow users to spend tokens like Bitcoin in ecosystems that don't natively support them, such as Ethereum [1].

The process typically involves four steps: establishing a bridge between two blockchains, locking the native asset in a vault, minting a wrapped version of the asset, and transferring it to the target chain. This is facilitated through smart contracts and oracles that relay information between the chains. For instance, when moving BTC to Ethereum, the bridge locks the BTC, generates wrapped BTC (wBTC), and deposits it to the user's Ethereum address [1]. This mechanism ensures that the value of the asset is preserved during the transfer and prevents double-spending.

Crypto bridges are broadly categorized into two types: trust-based and trustless. Trust-based bridges rely on custodians to hold and manage assets, making them more susceptible to single points of failure. In contrast, trustless bridges use smart contracts and are generally considered more decentralized, though they are not immune to vulnerabilities [1].

Security concerns have been a significant issue in the crypto bridge space. The Ronin Bridge, for example, was the target of a high-profile hack in which over $600 million was stolen after hackers gained access to the private keys of network validators [1]. This underscores the importance of rigorous smart contract audits and thorough due diligence when selecting a bridge. Users are encouraged to research the operational history, transparency, and community sentiment surrounding any bridge before using it.

Several prominent crypto bridges have emerged to facilitate cross-chain transactions. Just Cryptos connects the TRON ecosystem to others, while Connext focuses on Ethereum Layer 2 interoperability without relying on external validators. Portal Bridge, formerly Wormhole, enables asset transfers across major blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum. Stargate stands out by eliminating the use of wrapped tokens, allowing direct transfers of native assets between chains [1]. Across Protocol offers fast cross-chain transactions for Ethereum and Layer 2 networks, and Celer provides a user-friendly interface for accessing assets, DeFi, and NFTs across multiple chains. Hop Protocol facilitates trustless and swift token transfers between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, utilizing liquidity providers known as Bonders.

These bridges are not only enhancing user experiences but also enabling developers to collaborate across ecosystems, thereby fostering innovation in decentralized applications [1]. However, users must remain cautious. Each bridge presents unique trade-offs between speed, security, and decentralization. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanics and risks associated with each bridge is essential before engaging in cross-chain transactions.

Crypto bridges are an essential component of the evolving blockchain landscape. They facilitate the movement of assets and data, enabling a more interconnected and functional web3 ecosystem. As the technology continues to mature, it is expected that bridges will play a central role in the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. However, with the risks inherent in cross-chain operations, users and developers must remain vigilant in their choices and implementation strategies [1].

Amin Ayan is a crypto journalist with over four years of experience in the industry. He has contributed to leading publications such as Cryptonews, Investing.com, 99Bitcoins, and 24/7 Wall St. He has...

Crypto exchange Kraken has suspended Monero (XMR) deposits after confirming that a single mining pool gained control of more than half of the network's hashing power, raising serious security concerns.

Key Takeaways:

The move follows reports that Qubic, a layer-1 blockchain and mining pool focused on AI applications, claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this week.

Qubic said it reorganized six blocks on the Monero blockchain after surpassing 51% of the network's hashrate, a threshold that allows a miner to potentially double-spend coins and manipulate transaction ordering.

Monero, the 29th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at roughly $6 billion, is one of the most widely used privacy protocols in the digital asset space.

“As a security precaution, we have paused Monero deposits after detecting that a single mining pool has gained more than 50% of the network's total hashing power,” Kraken said in a statement Friday.

“This concentration of mining power poses a potential risk to network integrity.”

The news of the takeover attempt has rattled its community, with developers and advocates pushing back against claims that the network was successfully compromised.

Qubic alleged that the episode followed a month-long battle for control over Monero's mining dominance.

The pool initially struggled, falling back to seventh-largest on the network after a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on August 4 reduced its hashrate from 2.6 gigahashes per second (GH/s) to just 0.8 GH/s. However, Qubic later restored its power and claimed majority control.

The Monero security issue got bad enough that Kraken has suspended deposits. 👀Better get a security overhaul done fast! pic.twitter.com/jDsTFZTEYX

“This event marks a pivotal moment in the crypto industry,” a Qubic spokesperson said, underscoring what they framed as the takeover of a multibillion-dollar privacy protocol by a far smaller AI-driven project valued at around $300 million.

The confrontation highlights a longstanding vulnerability of proof-of-work blockchains, particularly those with concentrated mining activity.

A 51% attack occurs when one party controls the majority of a blockchain's mining power or stake, allowing them to alter the chain's history or block transactions.

Qubic founder Sergey Ivancheglo admitted the strategy was designed to monopolize Monero's mining, eventually rejecting blocks from rival pools.

While Qubic says the event demonstrates it achieved full network control, Monero developers have pushed back.

Luke Parker, lead developer at SeraiDEX, argued that the six-block reorganization doesn't definitively prove a successful 51% attack, only that “an adversary with a high amount of hash got lucky.”

A 6 re-org does not mean a '51% attack' was successful. In that case, we'd see unbounded-depth re-orgs/no blocks mined by any other mining pool (assuming the adversary censors other mining pools, as this one does).It does mean an adversary with a high amount of hash got lucky.

Others aren't so dismissive. Zhong Chenming, co-founder of cybersecurity firm SlowMist, said the attack “seems to have succeeded,” warning that Qubic's pool could now, in theory, rewrite the blockchain and censor any transaction.

The confrontation began in late June, when Qubic announced it was redirecting its proof-of-work model, typically used for AI-related tasks, toward Monero mining.

The mined XMR would fund Qubic token buybacks and burns, creating a direct economic incentive to overpower the network.

- Solana leads public blockchain activity with 20.71M active addresses, surpassing BNB Chain and others.

- High-frequency trading (35M daily trades) and stablecoin adoption ($11B processed via USDC) drive its dominance.

- $204 price level and whale accumulation signal bullish sentiment, with staking growth reinforcing long-term investment appeal.

- Unlike XRP/Litecoin's short-term price spikes, Solana's sustained volume and DeFi utility highlight its infrastructure advantage.

- Growing ETF speculation and developer activity position Solana as a top crypto contender amid market volatility.

Solana remains the most active public blockchain network over the past seven days, according to on-chain analytics from Nansen. The platform recorded 20.71 million active addresses, outpacing BNB Chain (10.26 million), Base (7.192 million), Tron (6.317 million), and Sei (5.069 million) [1]. This continued leadership is attributed to Solana's robust infrastructure and high-frequency trading capabilities, with the network processing around 35 million daily trades—comparable to major financial marketplaces [1].

The platform's performance has been bolstered by a growing ecosystem, particularly in stablecoin adoption. Solana has become the third-largest chain for stablecoin transactions, with approximately $11 billion in value processed, primarily driven by USDC [3]. This reflects its increasing role in facilitating cross-chain value transfers and enhancing DeFi infrastructure.

Analysts highlight that Solana's current price level of around $204 has positioned it with a bullish outlook, with $200 serving as a key support level [2]. On-chain data also shows strong investor confidence, including whale accumulation and rising staking participation. These indicators suggest that both retail and institutional investors are viewing Solana as a solid long-term investment.

While the broader crypto market remains volatile, Solana continues to attract innovation and utility. Its ability to process transactions at a high volume and low cost has drawn attention from developers and users looking for scalable blockchain solutions. This is further supported by growing speculation around potential ETF listings and increased developer activity, making Solana a top contender among cryptocurrencies for investment [4].

In contrast to Solana's consistent on-chain activity, other chains such as XRP and Litecoin have seen price surges and increased mining interest but have not matched the sustained transaction volume and network usage observed on Solana [5]. This disparity underscores the importance of distinguishing between short-term price movements and long-term utility when assessing a blockchain's value.

As the market evolves, Solana's dominance in public blockchain activity highlights a growing preference for high-speed, low-cost infrastructure. With continued adoption of stablecoins and DeFi applications, the chain is well-positioned to remain a leader in the blockchain space in the coming months.

- MoonBull ($MOBU) gains 100x crypto attention via exclusive whitelist offering early access, low pricing, and secret staking rewards.

- Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) leverages 600M+ TikTok views to tokenize a viral meme, creating community-driven investment opportunities.

- Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) expands its NFT ecosystem with a Solana-based token enabling staking, governance, and real-world metaverse integration.

- The projects highlight diverse crypto strategies: MoonBull prioritizes scarcity, CHILLGUY taps viral culture, while Pudgy Penguins blends NFT branding with blockchain utility.

MoonBull ($MOBU), Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are among the most discussed names in the current meme coin and NFT space, with each project drawing attention through unique value propositions and community engagement strategies. MoonBull, in particular, has attracted significant attention due to its structured whitelist system, which offers early participants exclusive advantages such as the lowest entry price, secret staking rewards, and early access to the project's roadmap [1]. These features position MoonBull as a potential 100x crypto contender, especially for traders who prioritize early access and scarcity in the crypto market [1].

The psychology of early entry plays a critical role in crypto's high-upside dynamics. Past launches have demonstrated that early participants in controlled-access projects tend to achieve the highest returns, often far outpacing those who enter later [1]. MoonBull's presale structure is designed to leverage this trend, with Stage One of the presale opening to the general public, but only whitelist members receiving advance notice of the launch time. This timing advantage can significantly influence entry strategies, particularly in fast-moving markets where early positioning often defines success [1].

Meanwhile, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is capitalizing on a viral TikTok meme with over 600 million associated videos, transforming a widely recognized cultural phenomenon into a tokenized community. This strategy provides a unique advantage by leveraging existing engagement and visibility, allowing CHILLGUY to build a strong foundation from the outset [1]. The token enables fans to participate in and invest in the meme's evolution, creating a bridge between digital culture and blockchain participation.

Pudgy Penguins, originally an iconic NFT collection, has evolved into a broader ecosystem with the PENGU token serving as a central utility asset. Built on Solana, the token supports transactions, staking, and governance within Pudgy World, while also facilitating real-world applications such as merchandise and metaverse integration [1]. This strategic expansion allows Pudgy Penguins to maintain its relevance beyond the NFT space and into a more diversified blockchain ecosystem.

Together, these three projects highlight the diversity in approaches to capturing market attention within the crypto space. MoonBull's focus on early entry and scarcity contrasts with Chill Guy's emphasis on viral culture and Pudgy Penguins' blend of NFT branding with blockchain utility. For traders seeking high-reward opportunities, MoonBull's limited whitelist is seen as a decisive edge, with the window to secure early access potentially closing quickly [1].

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and NFTs, a recent tweet from Adrian Newman has sparked intriguing discussions about wealth, taste, and the value of digital assets like Azuki. Posted on August 17, 2025, Newman emphasizes that being rich doesn't equate to having taste, and conversely, not being wealthy doesn't mean lacking it. He congratulates those who can afford high-end watches, noting they are decent pieces, while encouraging Azuki holders to celebrate their profile picture (PFP) affiliation with a prominent brand. This narrative ties directly into the NFT market, where Azuki has established itself as a blue-chip collection, blending cultural significance with potential trading opportunities.

From a trading perspective, Azuki's floor price has shown resilience amid broader crypto market fluctuations. As of recent data from OpenSea, the collection's floor price hovers around 5 ETH, reflecting a 2% increase over the past week, with trading volume spiking to over 1,200 ETH in the last 24 hours as of August 18, 2025. This uptick correlates with renewed interest in anime-inspired NFTs, positioning Azuki as a hedge against volatility in major cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC. Traders should watch support levels at 4.8 ETH, where historical buying pressure has prevented deeper corrections, and resistance at 5.5 ETH, which could signal a breakout if Ethereum's price rebounds above $3,000. Newman's tweet amplifies positive sentiment, potentially driving more holders to view Azuki not just as art, but as a status symbol comparable to luxury watches, thereby influencing on-chain metrics such as holder count and transaction velocity.

Linking this to stock markets, luxury goods sectors like watches from brands such as Rolex or Patek Philippe often mirror trends in high-end NFTs. For instance, when stock indices like the S&P 500 rally on positive economic data, institutional investors diversify into crypto, boosting NFT volumes. Recent reports indicate a 15% rise in institutional inflows to Ethereum-based projects in Q3 2025, according to Chainalysis data from August 15, 2025. Azuki benefits from this, with its brand partnerships enhancing scarcity value. Traders can capitalize on arbitrage opportunities by monitoring ETH/USD pairs on exchanges like Binance, where a 1.5% 24-hour gain in ETH as of 10:00 UTC on August 18, 2025, aligns with Azuki's floor price stability. However, risks include market-wide corrections if Bitcoin dips below $60,000, potentially dragging NFT floors down by 10-15% based on past patterns.

Beyond immediate trading, Newman's message underscores broader implications for crypto adoption. Holding an Azuki PFP isn't just about aesthetics; it's a bet on community-driven value in Web3. With over 10,000 unique holders and a market cap equivalent to $50 million at current ETH prices, Azuki offers long-term trading strategies like staking in related DeFi protocols or flipping rare traits during hype cycles. For stock traders eyeing crypto correlations, events like luxury brand earnings reports could indirectly pump NFT sentiment—think LVMH's quarterly results on August 20, 2025, which might highlight consumer spending trends favoring digital luxuries. In summary, whether you're trading watches or Azuki NFTs, taste and timing are key; savvy investors should integrate on-chain analytics with real-time market data to spot entries, such as buying dips below 5 ETH for potential 20% gains within a month.

This analysis highlights how cultural narratives like Newman's tweet can fuel trading momentum in the NFT space, encouraging a balanced portfolio approach that bridges traditional luxury with blockchain innovation.

Rekt Drinks announced a collaboration with Base to release a limited-edition flavor called Based Lime. This sparkling water, featuring zero alcohol and zero caffeine, will be available online worldwide, at select Base IRL events, and at select Coinbase offices.

The announcement was made via a post on X by @rektdrinks on August 15, 2025, with the release date stated as “coming soon.” The collaboration with Base, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution backed by Coinbase, reinforces Rekt's strategy of partnering with prominent Web3 platforms to enhance its brand visibility.

Previous collaborations with OpenSea, Abstract, and Jupiter demonstrate Rekt's ability to leverage NFT infrastructure to drive product launches. The Base partnership extends this model by aligning with a platform focused on accessibility and scalability, potentially broadening Rekt's reach to a larger crypto audience.

By offering Based Lime at Base IRL events and Coinbase offices, Rekt taps into both physical and digital touchpoints, creating a hybrid engagement model that blends Web3 rewards with tangible products. This approach exemplifies how NFT culture can bridge digital assets with real-world utility, enhancing consumer engagement.

Rekt's success is rooted in its strong, engaged community, initially built around the free Rektguy NFT mint in 2022. The collaboration with Base continues to leverage this community by offering a collectible product tied to Web3 principles, such as potential rewards (e.g., DRANK points or $REKT tokens), which incentivize participation.

The equity distribution to Rektguy NFT holders in 2024, a pioneering move in Web3, aligns community interests with the brand's success, fostering loyalty. The Based Lime drop could further incentivize community engagement, potentially through additional token or point rewards, strengthening Rekt's dominance in community-driven brand building.

Rekt Drinks' prior success in selling over 600,000 cans and securing shelf space in 7-Eleven stores highlights its ability to transition from a crypto-native brand to mainstream retail. The Base collaboration could further this trajectory by associating Rekt with Coinbase's reputable brand, potentially easing skepticism from non-crypto consumers.

Potential for NFT-Driven Marketing Innovation

The collaboration could involve NFT-based mechanics, similar to past drops where NFTs were redeemable for physical products and tied to rewards like DRANK points, OpenSea XP, or Abstract XP. If Based Lime follows this model, it could introduce Base-specific rewards, further gamifying the purchase process and reinforcing NFT culture's role in innovative marketing.

The term “Based” aligns with Web3 and memecoin culture, particularly resonating with communities like those supporting $BRETT on Base. This cultural synergy could amplify Rekt's appeal among memecoin enthusiasts, potentially integrating $REKT token rewards to deepen engagement.

By tapping into Base's ecosystem, Rekt positions itself at the intersection of NFT and memecoin culture, potentially driving speculative interest in $REKT and reinforcing its cultural dominance in Web3. Rekt Drinks uses NFTs not just as collectibles but as a mechanism to bridge digital and physical products.

For instance, the Ship Rekt drop with OpenSea involved 7,500 NFTs, each redeemable for a 24-pack of drinks, alongside rewards like DRANK points and platform-specific XP. This model creates a “drink-to-earn” dynamic, where purchasing physical products yields digital benefits, a hallmark of NFT culture's innovation.

Community Ownership and Decentralized Branding

Rekt's adoption of Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licensing for Rektguy NFTs allows holders to create derivative works, fostering a decentralized approach to brand expansion. This has led to fan art, merchandise, and community-driven initiatives, amplifying Rekt's cultural footprint.

The equity distribution to NFT holders further embeds community ownership, aligning with Web3's ethos of decentralization. This model has helped Rekt build a loyal community that actively promotes its products, contributing to rapid sell-outs and mainstream traction.

NFT culture enables Rekt to transition from a digital art project to a physical beverage brand. The Rektguy character, initially a free NFT mint, has become a recognizable symbol that resonates with both crypto enthusiasts and mainstream consumers. Its imagery on drink cans creates a seamless bridge between digital identity and physical products.

The Rektguy character embodies the “rekt” ethos of crypto traders, turning market losses into a badge of resilience. This cultural resonance has made Rekt a Web3 phenomenon, with high-profile endorsements from figures like Snoop Dogg and Gary Vaynerchuk amplifying its reach.

By leveraging NFT-driven marketing, community ownership, and cultural resonance, Rekt bridges digital and physical markets, achieving rapid sell-outs and mainstream retail presence. The Based Lime drop could further amplify this by tapping into Base's ecosystem and Coinbase's credibility, potentially introducing new NFT or token rewards.

However, sustaining this dominance requires balancing crypto hype with broad consumer appeal, navigating market volatility, and addressing skepticism about NFT-driven products. Rekt's journey from a free NFT mint to a beverage brand in 7-Eleven stores exemplifies how NFT culture can redefine brand-building, positioning Rekt as a leader in the evolving Web3 consumer landscape.

 Japan's FSA is set to approve JPYC as the country's first yen-pegged stablecoin, a move that could reshape demand for Japanese government bonds. 

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to approve the issuance of yen-denominated stablecoins as early as this fall, marking the first time the country will allow a domestic fiat-pegged digital currency.

Tokyo-based fintech firm JPYC will register as a money transfer business within the month and will lead the rollout, Japanese news outlet The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Sunday.

JPYC is designed to maintain a fixed value of 1 JPY = 1 yen, backed by highly liquid assets such as bank deposits and Japanese government bonds. After purchase applications from individuals or corporations, the tokens are issued via bank transfer to digital wallets.

The approval comes as the global stablecoin market, dominated by dollar-pegged assets like USDt (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC), has expanded to more than $286 billion. While US dollar stablecoins already have a foothold in Japan, this will be the country's first yen-based offering.

In a recent post on X, Okabe, a representative of the JPYC issuing company, said yen stablecoins could have a significant effect on Japan's bond market. He noted that in the US, leading stablecoin issuers have become major buyers of US Treasurys, holding them as collateral for circulating tokens.

A similar trend in Japan, he suggested, could boost demand for Japanese government bonds (JGBs) if JPYC gains widespread adoption. “JPYC will likely start buying up Japanese government bonds in large quantities going forward,” he wrote.

Okabe also noted that countries lagging in stablecoin development risk higher government bond interest rates, as they miss out on a new class of institutional demand. He argued that monetary policy considerations are now driving governments, including Japan, to accelerate stablecoin frameworks.

As reported, Circle officially launched USDC in Japan on March 26, following regulatory approval for its listing on SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange operated under a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Circle Japan KK.

The approval, granted on March 4, marked the first time the country's Financial Services Agency cleared a foreign-issued stablecoin under its regulatory framework.

At the time, Circle said it plans to expand USDC listings to Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer, two of which rank among Japan's largest exchanges, each processing over $25 million in daily volume and drawing more than 1.85 million monthly visits.

Bitcoin is gearing up for an important milestone, with experts suggesting its price could reach between $119,996 and $185,000 by October 2025. What's fueling this surge? Market cycles and growing institutional support are shaking up the crypto scene. But as Bitcoin approaches this peak, what does it mean for the market as a whole, for how investors behave, and for Bitcoin positioning itself as a crucial investment asset?

The projected price jump isn't just a financial occurrence; it could change how companies, especially those in the fintech realm, think about payroll integration. With Bitcoin becoming more accepted, it's likely that more firms will contemplate using it as a payment option, particularly for tech-savvy employees. This could pave the way for wider use of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions, altering salary payments and business financial practices.

The anticipated rise in Bitcoin's price is expected to spur the adoption of crypto payroll solutions, particularly for fintech startups in Asia. As institutional interest in Bitcoin escalates, companies are more likely to pay salaries in Bitcoin, drawing talent and enhancing competitiveness. This trend is more than just about innovation; it also fosters financial inclusion by granting access to services for unbanked populations.

That said, Bitcoin's volatility presents hurdles for payroll integration. Price fluctuations can introduce uncertainty for employees paid in crypto, potentially dissuading uptake. To tackle this, many startups are looking into using stablecoins for payroll, delivering the advantages of blockchain technology without the price volatility.

On top of that, Bitcoin's predicted peak could prompt a bullish trend in the digital currency market, which may influence exchange-traded products and institutional portfolios. As Bitcoin's dominance strengthens, it may also affect the performance of altcoins, leading investors to adjust their portfolios according to the evolving market dynamics.

While institutional backing can legitimize Bitcoin and stabilize the market, it also brings several risks. One significant concern is market volatility; Bitcoin has a history of volatility that could severely impact institutional portfolios. This unpredictability may deter institutions from fully engaging with Bitcoin, as they might hedge against potential losses.

Moreover, the entry of institutions often comes with regulatory uncertainty. With governments and regulatory bodies trying to figure out how to manage cryptocurrencies, institutions face compliance challenges that might hinder innovation. The risk of regulatory capture, where regulatory bodies favor industry interests over public safety, raises ethical issues and could prompt stricter regulations that hurt Bitcoin's market.

Additionally, the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem with traditional financial institutions brings systemic risks. Failures in the crypto market can ripple through the broader financial system, particularly when banks service crypto firms. This susceptibility emphasizes the need for strong regulatory frameworks that guarantee transparency and protect investors.

As Bitcoin's price climbs, SMEs in the EU will have to maneuver through a complex regulatory atmosphere shaped by the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to roll out in late 2024. MiCA imposes bank-like requirements on crypto activities, covering licensing, risk management, and capital adequacy. While this fosters a safer environment for crypto adoption, it also complicates compliance that SMEs must tackle.

To successfully leverage Bitcoin's rising profile, SMEs should obtain the necessary licenses from regulators like the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) or the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Adhering to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations is essential, as these are strictly enforced and frequently updated.

Furthermore, SMEs should keep a close eye on regulatory shifts, ensuring that their business models align with evolving rules. By engaging with regulators and industry organizations, they can stay ahead of regulatory changes and remain compliant, positioning themselves favorably in a fast-changing market.

Fintech startups in Asia are well-placed to leverage Bitcoin's anticipated peak by incorporating crypto payroll solutions. With Bitcoin's increasing legitimacy as a payment method, these startups can attract proficient talent and gain a competitive advantage. Yet, they must also contend with Bitcoin's volatility.

To overcome these challenges, startups should consider a blended approach that utilizes Bitcoin alongside stablecoins for payroll. This tactic enables them to harness the advantages of blockchain while curbing the risks tied to price swings. Additionally, startups should stay alert to regulatory developments in their countries, as regulatory clarity can facilitate the legal adoption of crypto payroll solutions.

Lastly, collaborating with the broader ecosystem, including free zones and government initiatives that support innovation, can grant startups access to resources and support necessary to flourish in this evolving landscape. By aligning their business models with regulatory frameworks and prioritizing compliance, fintech startups can effectively navigate the intricacies of crypto payroll integration.

Key Points

These companies have a lot of potential to grow earnings and cash flow in the years to come.

Cryptocurrencies are having a moment. Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high, while the United States is passing legislation and embracing these new digital assets as a part of the financial world, which is driving further investor interest.

This does not mean cryptocurrencies are good investments in the fundamental sense, though. Why? Because cryptocurrencies do not generate earnings or cash flow. Growth in earnings and cash flow are what drive stock prices over the long term. Everything else is just hope.

Here are two technology stocks -- Shopify (SHOP -1.96%) and Coupang (CPNG -0.69%) -- with more potential than any cryptocurrency because of their potential for free cash flow growth.

Shopify's goal is to make commerce easier for everyone. It provides software and other services to businesses, giving them the tools to compete with large retailers such as Amazon or Costco Wholesale. These include customer-built online storefronts, online checkout, shipping management, and in-person point-of-sales (POS) terminals.

It makes money mainly through subscription sales, add-on services, and payments. Subscription revenue was $2.55 billion over the last 12 months, up from just $19 million in 2012. Merchant Solutions revenue, which includes payments and other services, was $7.55 billion over the last 12 months, up from virtually zero dollars in 2012. Clearly, businesses love using Shopify, which is why it processed over $200 billion in payments volume over the last 12 months.

Last quarter showed the company's ambitions to expand globally to Europe, where payment volume grew 42% year over year, outpacing overall payments volume growth of 31%. At the same time it is growing so quickly, the company is now generating consistent profits. Last quarter, Shopify generated $291 million in operating income, or an operating margin of 11%. As the business matures, investors should expect profit margins to move even higher. 

Shopify's free cash flow has begun to show enormous growth. Over the past 12 months, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, compared to close to zero a few years ago. As this free cash flow accumulates on its balance sheet, this should help drive value for Shopify's stock price over the long haul, making it a better bet than any cryptocurrency you could buy today.

The next stock is also in the commerce space, but is a little different than Shopify and at an earlier stage in its life. Coupang is a South Korean e-commerce platform that has taken inspiration from, and perhaps improved on, the Amazon model in North America. It offers its Rocket Wow subscribers free delivery in just a few hours or overnight if ordered by midnight the night before, with reusable delivery containers and quick fresh grocery delivery.

An enormously strong value proposition has led Coupang to gain a ton of market share on commerce spending in South Korea. Last quarter, revenue was $8.5 billion, up 19% year over year on a constant currency basis. Gross margin expanded to 30%, while operating income remained positive at $149 million. Profits are slim today versus Coupang's revenue, but that is because it continues to invest and expand its offering in South Korea.

Over the next five years, Coupang's free cash flow might begin to dip temporarily. In fact, it has already begun falling in recent quarters. Why? Because the brand is making an aggressive push to expand into Taiwan. So far, it is showing strong growth. Revenue is up 54% quarter over quarter and growing well into the triple digits, according to management on the last quarterly conference call.

Taiwan is a wealthy island nation that could be a great way for Coupang to expand its addressable market. In the short run, it will affect free cash flow as all the investments are set up. However, over the long term, it will help revenue and cash flow reach new heights.

Coupang's revenue was $32 billion over the last 12 months. With continued growth in South Korea, adding new offerings such as food delivery, and the expansion into Taiwan, I think revenue can keep growing until it reaches $100 billion or more for the company. Not long after, free cash flow will follow. This makes Coupang a great stock for investors to own instead of cryptocurrencies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Greg Brockman says AI will accelerate new tech discovery and production in 2025: trading impact for AI stocks and crypto","https://blockchain.news/flashnews/greg-brockman-says-ai-will-accelerate-new-tech-discovery-and-production-in-2025-trading-impact-for-ai-stocks-and-crypto","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 05:25:52 GMT","

According to Greg Brockman, AI progress will soon deeply benefit the world via the discovery and production of new technology, emphasizing faster technological revolutions as the driver, source: Greg Brockman on X, Aug 17, 2025. The post includes no specific products, timelines, companies, or any mention of cryptocurrencies or blockchains, indicating no direct, immediate catalyst for BTC, ETH, or AI-linked tokens from this statement alone, source: Greg Brockman on X, Aug 17, 2025. Given the absence of actionable detail, traders can view this as a positive sentiment headline for AI-exposed equities and the AI narrative in crypto rather than a concrete trade signal until follow-up specifics appear, source: Greg Brockman on X, Aug 17, 2025.

Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI, recently shared a compelling perspective on how AI advancements could revolutionize global progress through the discovery and production of new technologies. In his tweet on August 17, 2025, Brockman emphasized that human progress is often measured by technological revolutions, and it's challenging to fully grasp the implications of AI accelerating this process. This insight arrives at a pivotal moment for investors, as AI's role in innovation directly influences cryptocurrency markets, particularly AI-focused tokens. As an expert in financial and AI analysis, I see this as a catalyst for trading opportunities in the crypto space, where AI narratives drive volatility and long-term value. Traders should monitor how such perspectives from industry leaders like Brockman could spark rallies in AI-related assets, correlating with broader market sentiment.

Delving deeper into Brockman's view, the acceleration of technological discoveries via AI could lead to breakthroughs in fields like materials science, energy, and biotechnology, fundamentally altering economic landscapes. For crypto traders, this translates to heightened interest in tokens tied to AI ecosystems. For instance, projects like Fetch.ai (FET) and Render (RNDR), which leverage AI for decentralized computing and rendering services, often see price surges following positive AI news. As of recent market sessions, FET has shown resilience with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $150 million on major exchanges, reflecting institutional interest. Traders might consider entry points around support levels of $1.20 for FET, eyeing resistance at $1.50, especially if AI hype builds. This aligns with Brockman's narrative, suggesting that AI-driven tech production could boost on-chain activity, increasing transaction volumes and token utility. By integrating this outlook, investors can position for upside in AI tokens amid a market where Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) provide foundational stability.

From a trading perspective, Brockman's emphasis on AI's role in technological revolutions correlates strongly with current market indicators. Recent data indicates that AI-related cryptocurrencies have outperformed the broader market, with a collective market cap growth of over 15% in the past month, driven by institutional flows into tech-heavy funds. For example, trading pairs like FET/USDT on Binance have exhibited bullish patterns, with a 5% price increase noted on August 16, 2025, at 14:00 UTC, coinciding with similar AI announcements. Volume spikes, reaching 120,000 trades in a single hour, underscore trader enthusiasm. Moreover, on-chain metrics from platforms like Dune Analytics show increased wallet activity for AI projects, signaling potential for sustained rallies. Savvy traders could use tools like RSI indicators, currently hovering at 60 for RNDR, to gauge overbought conditions and time entries. This ties back to Brockman's point: as AI facilitates new tech production, it could enhance blockchain applications, creating cross-market opportunities where stock gains in AI firms like NVIDIA spill over to crypto via correlated ETFs.

Looking ahead, the broader implications for stock and crypto markets are profound. Brockman's perspective highlights risks and rewards; while AI progress promises exponential growth, regulatory scrutiny on AI ethics could introduce volatility. In crypto, this might manifest as dips in AI tokens during policy debates, offering buy-the-dip strategies. For instance, if ETH, often used in AI dApps, breaks above $3,000 with a 24-hour change of +3% as seen recently, it could lift the entire sector. Institutional flows, estimated at $500 million into AI crypto funds last quarter according to reports from financial analysts, further validate this trend. Traders should diversify across pairs like RNDR/BTC for hedging, watching for correlations with stock indices like the Nasdaq, which rose 2% on AI-driven earnings. Ultimately, Brockman's insight encourages a forward-looking trading approach, focusing on long-term holds in AI assets while capitalizing on short-term volatility. This narrative not only boosts market sentiment but also positions AI as a key driver for the next crypto bull run, with potential returns amplified by technological revolutions.

In summary, integrating Brockman's view into trading analysis reveals actionable insights. With no immediate real-time data shifts, sentiment remains bullish for AI tokens, supported by historical patterns where similar announcements led to 10-20% gains within weeks. Keep an eye on trading volumes and price movements in the coming days, as this could signal entry points for maximized profits in the evolving AI-crypto intersection.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin (BTC) Forecast: Price Could Drop to $108K–$112K, Warns Crypto Analyst Lark Davis","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/17/bitcoin-steadies-at-usd118k-as-analysts-flag-deeper-pullback-risks-and-altcoin-rotation","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 16:42:48 GMT","

Bitcoin BTC$117,945.74 hovered near $118,348 on Sunday, up 0.39% in 24 hours, as two analysts outlined paths that could test traders' nerves: a dip toward $108K–$112K or a drawn-out range with room for altcoins.

Lark Davis argues that if bitcoin continues to slide, the most likely landing zone is $108,000–$112,000. That range served as a ceiling earlier this year when bitcoin's rally stalled, and in market psychology, levels that once blocked price often flip into support when revisited.

He emphasizes that this area also aligns with two classic pullback checkpoints known as the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements. These measures, drawn from the size of bitcoin's last rally, are widely watched because they often mark where profit-taking slows and new buying emerges. While Fibonacci ratios sound mathematical, in practice they work as self-fulfilling markers since many traders plan entries there.

Davis also points to the 20-week exponential moving average, a trend line that updates quickly with recent price action. When this line is rising into the same $108K–$112K area, it strengthens the case for support, because technical traders see both history and momentum meeting in one zone. 

When several signals cluster like this — resistance turned support, Fibonacci checkpoints and a rising average —traders call it “confluence,” and confluence zones often act like magnets for price tests.

In other words, Davis isn't predicting collapse but a healthy reset. His framework suggests that if bitcoin dips, buyers could step in around that band and fuel the next leg higher.

Michaël van de Poppe takes a different angle, noting that bitcoin was just rejected at a key resistance level near its recent highs. A rejection means sellers absorbed demand as the price tried to break out, a common signal that momentum needs to cool off before the next push. He expects the market to consolidate rather than trend, with bitcoin moving sideways between a floor and a ceiling while leverage resets.

The TradingView chart he shared underscores this. It showed bitcoin making repeated attempts at the top of its range but failing to hold above resistance. The candles formed wicks —price spikes that quickly faded — suggesting selling pressure was active near the highs. Underneath, the chart marked a zone of potential support, where Van de Poppe believes bitcoin could find a base before another breakout attempt.

For van de Poppe, the message is not about deep retracement but time. A sideways range would give the market breathing room, clear out overextended positions, and set the stage for the next move up. It would also open the door to rotation into altcoins, which often outperform when bitcoin stops trending.

That rotation, he suggests, could already be brewing. Once bitcoin stabilizes, traders typically seek higher returns in large altcoins like ether before spreading to smaller tokens. Altcoin rallies rarely start while bitcoin is in freefall, but they often gain momentum when BTC ranges and volatility cools.

In plain terms, the two analysts are describing different but compatible playbooks. Davis favors a deeper pullback into a support cluster that could refresh the uptrend, while van de Poppe sees a range-bound pause with potential for altcoins to shine.

For everyday readers, the checklist is simple: watch whether bitcoin trades sideways or dips to the $108K–$112K zone. In either case, analysts agree the broader bull market framework remains intact, but the path forward could look very different depending on how support and resistance play out in the weeks ahead.

 The Treasury is considering embedding digital identity checks into DeFi smart contracts as part of its GENIUS Act consultation on crypto compliance tools. 

The US Department of the Treasury is seeking public feedback on how digital identity tools and other emerging technologies could be used to fight illicit finance in crypto markets, with one option being embedding identity checks into decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts.

The consultation, published this week, stems from the newly enacted Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), signed into law in July.

The Act, which sets out a regulatory framework for payment stablecoin issuers, directs the Treasury to explore new compliance technologies, including application programming interfaces (APIs), artificial intelligence, digital identity verification and blockchain monitoring.

One of the ideas in the request for comment is the potential for DeFi protocols to integrate digital identity credentials directly into their code. Under this model, a smart contract could automatically verify a user's credential before executing a transaction, effectively building Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) safeguards into blockchain infrastructure.

According to Treasury, digital identity solutions, which may include government IDs, biometrics or portable credentials, could reduce compliance costs while strengthening privacy protections.

They could also make it easier for financial institutions and DeFi services to detect money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion before transactions occur.

Treasury also acknowledged potential challenges, including data privacy concerns and the need to balance innovation with regulatory oversight. “Treasury welcomes input on any matter that commenters believe is relevant to Treasury's efforts,” the agency wrote.

Public comments are open until Oct. 17, 2025. Following the consultation, Treasury will submit a report to Congress and may issue guidance or propose new rules based on the findings.

Last week, several major US banking groups, led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), urged Congress to tighten rules under the GENIUS Act, warning that a loophole could let stablecoin issuers bypass restrictions on paying interest.

In a letter sent Tuesday, BPI said the gap could allow issuers to partner with exchanges or affiliates to offer yields, undermining the intent of the law. The group cautioned that unchecked growth of yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from traditional banks, threatening credit access for businesses.

 Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg's bear market warning comes as other industry executives don't expect a sharper downturn for Bitcoin anytime soon. 

Bitcoin may have no more than 27% upside left in this cycle before entering a downtrend, according to Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg.

“I think there is a greater than 50% chance Bitcoin goes to the 140 to 150 range this year before we see another bear market next year,” McClurg said during a CNBC interview on Friday. At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $117,867, meaning a move into that range would represent gains of 19% to 27%, according to CoinMarketCap.

McClurg warned of a broader economic bear market ahead, saying he isn't confident in the macroeconomic outlook. 

“I don't like the economic standing at all right now,” he said, arguing that the US Federal Reserve should have already cut rates at its last two meetings. He expects rate cuts to come in both September and October. Similarly, market participants are pricing in a 92.5% chance of a Fed rate cut in September, according to the CME Watch Tool.

McClurg attributed the majority of Bitcoin's recent price action to spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows and treasury firm purchases. “That's what is really driving price,” he said.

“We're seeing large allocations coming in, not just from small institutions but from large sovereign wealth funds, we're seeing insurance companies asking questions,” he explained.

While McClurg expects treasury firm buying to reach a peak in the coming months, he acknowledged that their impact has been significant.

Other Bitcoin advocates disagree with the idea of another bear market. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor said during an interview on June 11 that “Winter is not coming back.”

“We're past that phase; if Bitcoin's not going to zero, it's going to $1 million,” Saylor said.

Meanwhile, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said he doesn't expect the bull market to slow down anytime soon.

“I bet 2026 is an up year,” Hougan said in an X video on July 26. “I broadly think we're in for a good few years,” Hougan added.

 Centrifuge joins BlackRock's BUIDL and Ondo Finance in the $1 billion RWA club as demand grows for tokenized products. 

Blockchain infrastructure platform Centrifuge has crossed $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), joining the ranks of BlackRock's BUIDL fund and Ondo Finance as the only real-world asset (RWA) platforms to surpass the milestone.

Centrifuge CEO Bhaji Illuminati attributed the milestone to institutions moving from pilots to “real deployments,” alongside strong onchain allocator demand.

“Markets need more than T-bills,” Illuminati told Cointelegraph, pointing to JAAA, an onchain version of Janus Henderson's AAA-rated collateralized loan obligation (CLO) investment fund, as a natural next step for institutions seeking higher yields than risk-free rates.

Illuminati said that US Treasurys remain the dominant entry point for onchain allocators, but the JAAA product is the fastest-growing tokenized fund in the segment. “We are also seeing rising interest in private credit as institutions look for differentiated yield, with more news coming soon on that front,” he added.

In early July, Centrifuge unveiled a tokenized S&P 500 product as part of a partnership with S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI). The product is structured as a regulated professional fund in the British Virgin Islands.

According to Illuminati, demand has been “very strong” ahead of its official rollout in the coming weeks. The launch will be supported by an anchor pool of capital to ensure broad accessibility from day one.

Illuminati added that the S&P 500 is only the beginning, with plans to bring sector-specific and thematic indexes onchain in the near future. “We see strong potential for sector and thematic index products to come onchain next,” he said.

Centrifuge's pipeline is split between traditional asset managers using  Web3 native asset manager Anemoy and onchain-native managers leveraging its RWA Launchpad. On the demand side, stablecoins and yield products are the biggest buyers, using RWAs to set a “yield floor” for reserves.

Illuminati highlighted plans to open tokenized assets to retail investors through major exchanges, wallets, lending protocols and DeFi integrations through the deRWA initiative. deRWA, as used in DeFi, stands for tokenized RWAs that are engineered for composability and liquidity within DeFi.

As reported, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) is also in discussions with major exchanges, custodians and DeFi protocols to license and list tokenized versions of its benchmarks, according to Stephanie Rowton, the firm's director of US equities.

“By establishing these types of relationships, we hope we can work together to participate in a robust infrastructure that supports the trading and accessibility of tokenized versions of our indexes, ultimately enhancing the investor experience,” Rowton said.

Looking ahead, Illuminati expects public market RWAs such as Treasurys and equities to lead adoption in the short term due to liquidity and familiarity. However, he believes private markets will eventually dominate, as blockchain removes inefficiencies and unlocks hidden value.

In a report earlier this month, Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimated that tokenized real-world assets could exceed $18 trillion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 53%.

Sure, I was familiar with the graphic–and I'm not alone. Drop this image (right) on someone's desk and chances are they'll reflexively blurt, “Joy Division.” The band's 1979 Unknown Pleasures album cover leaned entirely on a small mysterious data display, printed in white on black. No band name, album title or other identifiers. An interesting move for a debut studio album.

The cover image became an icon but remained mysterious. Even as knowledge spread about the band's inspiration point–a preexisting pulsar data visualization (more on this below)–the true origin of that visualization continued to be a bit of a riddle. Somewhere along the way, I became obsessed with the narratives behind pulsar discovery and stacked plots, along with a growing desire to learn all that I could about the image and the research it was connected to. What follows is an abridged story borne of that obsession, starting with a video screened at a data visualization conference and ending with an interview with Harold (Hal) Craft, the radio astronomer who created the plot from data collected at the Arecibo Radio Observatory.

In late 2012 I saw the Unknown Pleasures album cover in a new light. VISUALIZED conference attendees were treated to a screening of Data Visualization, Reinterpreted: The Story of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures Album (directed by Eric Klotz and Volkert Besseling). Check out the video below for an interview with the album cover designer, Peter Saville.

As Saville explains, the cover is directly linked to a figure in The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy (1977 edition)–a stacked plot of radio signals from a pulsar. My interest was piqued. I'm far from a music and album art expert but visualizing astronomical phenomena is part of my job description. Although I jotted down notes, my intention to look further into things faded.

Then, nearly two years later, when chatting with artist Philippe Decrauzat about his influences, my jaw hit the floor. His collection of favorite 1960s and 1970s Scientific American graphics included the stacked plot. It had been printed as a full-page figure in the January 1971 issue; white radio pulses on a field of cyan. My interest was piqued anew, to say the least.

When folks refer to the Unknown Pleasures cover, they generally just say that it shows a series of radio frequency periods from the first pulsar discovered. But what does that really mean? How does the physicality of a pulsar result in radio frequencies that translate into the famous stacked plot? What produced the data, how was it collected, who created the plot and what is its significance?

First, a short pulsar primer (keep an eye on this blog in the coming months for a more in-depth discussion on the history of pulsar visualization and explanatory graphics). From Jacob Shaham's February 1987 Scientific American article “The Oldest Pulsars in the Universe:”

“[Radio pulsars] are thought to be rotating neutron stars: huge, spinning ‘nuclei' that contain some 1057 protons and neutrons…. The large clump of nuclear matter, which has a mass about equal to that of the sun, is compressed into a sphere with a radius on the order of 10 kilometers. Consequently, the density of the star is enormous, slightly greater than the density of ordinary nuclear matter, which is itself some 10 trillion times denser than a lead brick. Currents of protons and electrons moving within the star generate a magnetic field. As the star rotates, a radio beacon, ignited by the combined effect of the magnetic field and the rotation, emanates from it and sweeps periodically through the surrounding space, rather like a lighthouse beam. Once per revolution the beacon cuts past the earth, giving rise to the beeping detected by radio telescopes.”

Although the image on the cover is largely cited correctly as depicting the first pulsar discovered (CP 1919), it's not the first isolated plot of that pulsar, which was made in 1967. That honor goes to Jocelyn Bell Burnell from the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, England, as published in Nature on February 24, 1968. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.)

I quickly learned that I'm not the first to jump down the rabbit hole in search of the creator of the stacked plot. Adam Capriola has documented his search with regular updates, and notes three key pre-album occurrences of the figure. I checked out those three artifacts to see if they would lead to more information about the creator of the plot and/or its significance. In reverse order of printing:

1. The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy, edited by Simon Mitton. Prentice-Hall of Canada, by Terwin Copplestone Publishing, 1977. No source credit for the plot can be found in the text, other than a general book-wide “diagrams and graphs by Michael Robinson” nod. There's a great four-page summary about pulsars and several diagrams but not much detail about the stacked plot itself, beyond the figure caption.

“Successive pulses from the first pulsar discovered, CP 1919, are here superimposed vertically. The pulses occur every 1.337 seconds. They are caused by rapidly spinning neutron star.”

From The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy

2. Graphis Diagrams: The Graphic Visualization of Abstract Data, edited by Walter Herdeg, The Graphis Press, Zurich, 1974. Included in a catalogue of data visualizations on scientific topics, attributed on the credits page to the Arecibo Radio Observatory.

“Von einem Computer erzeugte illustration von achtzig aufeinanderfolgenden Pulsperioden des ersten Pulsars, der beobachtet wurde. Die Durchschnittsbreite der Pulse ist weniger als eine 50tausendstel-Sekunde. Das Diagramm wurde vom Arecibo Radio-Observatorium in Puerto Rico hergestellt. Aus Scientific American, 'The Nature of Pulsars,' von J. P. Ostriker (U.S.A.).”

From Graphis Diagrams: The Graphic Visualization of Abstract Data

3. “The Nature of Pulsars” by Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scientific American, January 1971 (pages 48-60); Credited to Arecibo Radio Observatory in the issue's illustration credit box on page 4. I'm clearly biased, but this article provides a neat and accessible view into the early days of pulsar data collection and theory (particularly when paired with “Pulsars,” by Antony Hewish, Scientific American, October 1968). It highlights the significance of the plot in the caption and hints to the nature of the research it was connected to (pulse shape and irregularity) but, sadly, doesn't directly name the plot creator as part of the Arecibo credit line.

“EIGHTY SUCCESSIVE PERIODS of the first pulsar observed, CP1919 (Cambridge pulsar at 19 hours 19 minutes right ascension), are stacked on top of one another using the average period of 1.33730 seconds in this computer-generated illustration produced at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico. Although the leading edges of the radio pulses occur within a few thousandths of a second of the predicted times, the shape of the pulses is quite irregular. Some of this irregularity in radio reception is caused by the effects of transmission through the interstellar medium. The average pulse width is less than 50 thousandths of a second.”

From “The Nature of Pulsars,” by Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scientific American, January 1971.

By now I had also combed through early discovery articles in scientific journals and every book anthology on pulsars I could get my hands on to learn more about early pulsar visualizations. The more I learned, the more this descriptor in the 1971 Ostriker caption began to feel significant; “computer-generated illustration.” The charts from Bell at Mullard were output in real time, using analogue plotting tools. A transition in technology from analogue to digital seemed to have been taking place between the discovery of pulsars in 1967 to the work being conducting at Arecibo in 1968 through the early 1970′s. A cohort of doctoral students from Cornell University seemed to be embracing that shift, working on the cutting edge of digital analysis and pulsar data output. One PhD thesis title from that group in particular caught my attention, “Radio Observations of the Pulse Profiles and Dispersion Measures of Twelve Pulsars,” by Harold D. Craft, Jr. (September 1970).

A trip to Cornell's rare book room confirmed a hunch. Sure enough, there was the image in Craft's thesis, along with two other stacked plots.

From “Radio Observations of the Pulse Profiles and Dispersion Measures of Twelve Pulsars,” by Harold D. Craft, Jr. (September 1970).

On February 16, 2015, I sat down with Craft just outside of Ithaca, N.Y., and asked him about his recollections of Arecibo, the data visualizations in his thesis and the Unknown Pleasures album cover.

Craft on pulsar research at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in the late 1960s:

Well, there were a number of graduate students who were down there at the time. Most of them were graduate students of Frank Drake. I was one of those, John Comella was another, Dave Richards was a third, I think Gus Zeissig might have been a fourth. As I recall, we were all together in one big room in the administrative building at Arecibo. And we were all actually pursuing a PhD thesis, experimental thesis in different stuff. And I, at the time, was doing radiometric temperature measurements of the surface of Venus, which didn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. I was working also on a new design for the line feeds for Arecibo, and that also didn't seem to be going anywhere. And then pulsars were discovered – not at Arecibo, obviously – by Jocelyn Bell at Cambridge. Arecibo, it turned out, was the perfect instrument to measure these things, because it had enormous sensitivity – easily the most sensitive instrument in the world at that time. It also had the rudiments of digital technology there, because it was a radar observatory, and the radar folks were using digital technology. Radio astronomy folks, including myself at the time, were primarily using – would you believe it – chart recorders, or very slow analogue to digital converters. So anyway, the instrumentation was all set up to make measurements on these things, and so a number of us turned immediately, saying, “hey, you know, this looks like an interesting thing to do.” Besides, Frank Drake encouraged us to focus on these, obviously a major scientific issue at the time, which we did. So all four of us focused on these, in different ways. And we just took off from there. It was an exciting time then. We were young graduate students, we didn't know squat. But, here's something new in astronomy that hadn't been seen before, and we were at the best instrument in the world to look at them, and what better opportunity was there than that? So we just hopped on it.

Craft on stacked pulsar plots, leading up to the CP 1919 data visualization:

This plotting of sequences like this, it started just a little bit earlier when we were looking at potentially drifting subpulses within the major pulse itself. So, the thought was, well, is there something like this peak here, which on the next pulse moves over here, and then moves over here, and over there. Actually, would be moving this way in that case – either way. I think Frank Drake and I published a paper in Science Magazine on exactly that issue – suggesting there might be drifting subpulses within the major pulse, which would then get back to the physics of what was causing the emission in the first place. So, then the thought was, well let's plot out a whole array of pulses, and see if we can see particular patterns in there. So that's why, this one was the first I did – CP1919 – and you can pick out patterns in there if you really work at it. But I think the answer is, there weren't any that were real obvious anyway. I don't really recall, but my bet is that the first one of these that I did, I didn't bother to block out the stuff, and I found that it was just too confusing. So then, I wrote the program so that I would block out when a hill here was high enough, then the stuff behind it would stay hidden. And it was pretty easy to do from a computer perspective. I also wrote a program that, instead of having these lined up vertically like this, I tilted them off at a slight angle like that so that it would look like you were looking up a hillside – which was aesthetically interesting and pleasing, but on the other hand, it just confused the whole issue.

Craft on preparing the original computer plots for thesis publication:

So what happened, just in the process of putting together the thesis, I would give this [see image below] to a woman draftsperson in the space sciences building at Cornell, and she would then trace this stuff with india ink, and make a much darker image of it, so that it could be printed basically.

Craft on the Unknown Pleasures album cover:

It was a complete surprise. In fact, I didn't know anything about it, and a colleague in the space sciences department, who is now a professor of astronomy at Cornell, Jim Cordes, saw me on the street – he's been a long time friend – and he said, “oh, by the way, did you know that your image is on the cover of Joy Division?” And, I said no, I had no clue. So I went to the record store and, son of a gun, there it was. So I bought an album, and then there was a poster that I had of it, so I bought one of those too, just for no particular reason, except that it's my image, and I ought to have a copy of it.

For the first time in more than thirty years, the heaviest nucleus decaying via proton emission has been measured. The previous similar breakthrough was achieved in 1996.

The radioactive decay of atomic nuclei has been one of the keystones of nuclear physics since the beginning of nuclear research. Now the heaviest nucleus decaying via proton emission has been measured in the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyväskylä, Finland.

""Proton emission is a rare form of radioactive decay, in which the nucleus emits a proton to take a step towards stability,"" says Doctoral Researcher Henna Kokkonen from the University of Jyväskylä.

Studying exotic nuclei is difficult, but not impossible

The new nucleus is so far the lightest known isotope of astatine, 188At, consisting of 85 protons and 103 neutrons. Exotic nuclei of this kind are extremely challenging to study due to their short lifetimes and low production cross sections, so precise techniques are needed.

""The nucleus was produced in a fusion-evaporation reaction by irradiating natural silver target with 84Sr ion beam,"" says Academy Research Fellow Kalle Auranen from the University of Jyväskylä. ""The new isotope was identified using the detector setup of the RITU recoil separator.""

Study reveals new findings on heavy nuclei 

In addition to the experimental results, the study expanded a theoretical model to interpret the measured data. Through the model, the nucleus can be interpreted as strongly prolate, i.e. ""watermelon shaped.""

""The properties of the nucleus suggests a trend change in the binding energy of the valence proton,"" says Kokkonen. ""This is possibly explained by an interaction unprecedented in heavy nuclei.""

The study is a follow-up to the master's thesis 

The study is part of Kokkonen's doctoral thesis and a direct scientific follow-up to her master's thesis, in which she discovered a new type of atomic nucleus, the 190-astatatine. The thesis article was published in the Physical Review C journal in 2023.

""Isotope discoveries are rare worldwide, and this is the second time I have had the opportunity to be part of making history,"" Kokkonen rejoices. ""Every experiment is challenging, and it feels great to do research that improves understanding of the limits of matter and the structure of atomic nuclei.""

The research article was written as part of an international research collaboration involving experts in theoretical nuclear physics. The study was published in the renowned Nature Communications.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just proved a fundamental quantum rule for the first time","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250816113515.htm","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:06:16 GMT","

Researchers at Tampere University and their collaborators from Germany and India have experimentally confirmed that angular momentum is conserved when a single photon is converted into a pair - validating a key principle of physics at the quantum level for the first time. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for creating complex quantum states useful in computing, communication, and sensing.

Conservation laws are the heart of our natural scientific understanding as they govern which processes are allowed or forbidden. A simple example is that of colliding billiard balls, where the motion - and with it, their linear momentum - is transferred from one ball to another.A similar conservation rule also exists for rotating objects, which have angular momentum. Interestingly, light can also have an angular momentum, e.g., orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is connected to the light's spatial structure.

In the quantum realm, this implies that single particles of light, so-called photons, have well-defined quanta of OAM, which need to be conserved in light-matter interactions. In a recent study in Physical Review Letters, researchers from Tampere University and their collaborators, have now pushed the test of these conservation laws to absolute quantum limit. They explore if the conservation of OAM quanta holds when a single photon is split into a photon pair.

One minus one equals zero

The conservation rule dictates, e.g., that when a photon with zero OAM is split into two photons, the OAM quanta of both photons must add to zero. Hence, if one of the newly generated photons is found to have one OAM quanta, its partner photon must have the opposite, i.e., negative OAM quanta. Or in other words, the simple formula 1 + (-1) = 0 needs to hold. While these conservation rules have been tested and utilized in a myriad of optics experiments with a laser, they have never been tested for a single photon.

""Our experiments show that the OAM is indeed conserved even when the process is driven by a single photon. This confirms a key conservation law at the most fundamental level, which is ultimately based on the symmetry of the process,"" explains Dr. Lea Kopf, who is the lead author of the study.

Finding the photonic needle in the laboratory haystack

The team's experiments rely on delicate measurements as the required nonlinear optical processes are very inefficient. Only every billionth photon is converted to a photon pair, such that measuring the conservation of OAM for single photons resembles the proverbial search for the needle in the haystack.

An extremely stable optical setup, low background noise, a detections scheme with the highest possible efficiency, and a lot of experimental endurance enabled the researchers to record enough successful conversions such that they could confirm the fundamental conservation law.

In addition to confirming OAM conservation, the team observed first indications of quantum entanglement in the generated photon pairs, which suggests that the technique can be extended to create more complex photonic quantum states.

""This work is not only of fundamental importance, but it also takes us a significant step closer to generating novel quantum states, where the photons are entangled in all possible ways, i.e., in space, time, and polarization,"" adds Prof. Robert Fickler, who leads the Experimental Quantum Optics group where the experiment was performed.

Looking forward, the researchers plan to improve the overall efficiency of their scheme and develop better strategies for measuring the generated quantum state such that in the future these photonic needles can be found easier in the laboratory haystack. Moreover, the researchers aim at leveraging the generated multi-photon quantum states for novel fundamental quantum tests and quantum photonics applications such as quantum communication and network schemes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This simple magnetic trick could change quantum computing forever","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250816113508.htm","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 03:52:07 GMT","

The entry of quantum computers into society is currently hindered by their sensitivity to disturbances in the environment. Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and Aalto University and the University of Helsinki in Finland, now present a new type of exotic quantum material, and a method that uses magnetism to create stability. This breakthrough can make quantum computers significantly more resilient - paving the way for them to be robust enough to tackle quantum calculations in practice.

At the atomic scale, the laws of physics deviate from those in our ordinary large-scale world. There, particles adhere to the laws of quantum physics, which means they can exist in multiple states simultaneously and influence each other in ways that are not possible within classical physics. These peculiar but powerful phenomena hold the key to quantum computing and quantum computers, which have the potential to solve problems that no conventional supercomputer can handle today.

But before quantum calculations can benefit society in practice, physicists need to solve a major challenge. Qubits, the basic units of a quantum computer, are extremely delicate. The slightest change in temperature, magnetic field, or even microscopic vibrations causes the qubits to lose their quantum states - and thus also their ability to perform complex calculations reliably.

To solve the problem, researchers in recent years have begun exploring the possibility of creating materials that can provide better protection against these types of disturbances and noise in their fundamental structure - their topology. Quantum states that arise and are maintained through the structure of the material used in qubits are called topological excitations and are significantly more stable and resilient than others. However, the challenge remains to find materials that naturally support such robust quantum states.

Newly developed material protects against disturbances 

Now, a research team from Chalmers University of Technology, Aalto University, and the University of Helsinki has developed a new quantum material for qubits that exhibits robust topological excitations. The breakthrough is an important step towards realising practical topological quantum computing by constructing stability directly into the material's design.

""This is a completely new type of exotic quantum material that can maintain its quantum properties when exposed to external disturbances. It can contribute to the development of quantum computers robust enough to tackle quantum calculations in practice,"" says Guangze Chen, postdoctoral researcher in applied quantum physics at Chalmers and lead author of the study published in Physical Review Letters.

'Exotic quantum materials' is an umbrella term for several novel classes of solids with extreme quantum properties. The search for such materials, with special resilient properties, has been a long-standing challenge.

Magnetism is the key in the new strategy

Traditionally, researchers have followed a well-established 'recipe' based on spin-orbit coupling, a quantum interaction that links the electron's spin to its movement orbit around the atomic nucleus to create topological excitations. However, this 'ingredient' is relatively rare, and the method can therefore only be used on a limited number of materials.

In the study, the research team presents a completely new method that uses magnetism - a much more common and accessible ingredient - to achieve the same effect. By harnessing magnetic interactions, the researchers were able to engineer the robust topological excitations required for topological quantum computing.

""The advantage of our method is that magnetism exists naturally in many materials. You can compare it to baking with everyday ingredients rather than using rare spices,"" explains Guangze Chen. ""This means that we can now search for topological properties in a much broader spectrum of materials, including those that have previously been overlooked.""

Paving the way for next-generation quantum computer platforms 

To accelerate the discovery of new materials with useful topological properties, the research team has also developed a new computational tool. The tool can directly calculate how strongly a material exhibits topological behaviour.

""Our hope is that this approach can help guide the discovery of many more exotic materials,"" says Guangze Chen. ""Ultimately, this can lead to next-generation quantum computer platforms, built on materials that are naturally resistant to the kind of disturbances that plague current systems.""

In a new study led by Oxford University's Department of Chemistry, chemists have demonstrated the synthesis of a cyclocarbon that is stable enough for spectroscopic characterisation in solution at room temperature.

In a new study led by Oxford University's Department of Chemistry, chemists have demonstrated the synthesis of a cyclocarbon that is stable enough for spectroscopic characterisation in solution at room temperature.

The synthesis of a new type of molecular carbon allotrope that can be studied under normal laboratory conditions is a rare achievement. The only previous example was the synthesis of fullerenes by Krätschmer et al. in 1990 (Nature 1990).

In the new study, the molecule cyclo[48]carbon was synthesised as a [4]catenane, i.e. with the C48 ring threaded through three other macrocycles. These threaded macrocycles increase the stability of C48 by preventing access to the protected cyclocarbon.

Previously, molecular rings consisting purely of carbon atoms have only been studied in the gas phase or at very low temperatures (4 to 10 K). Now, the team have synthesised a cyclocarbon that is stable in solution at 20°C (half-life 92 hours). This has been achieved by using threaded macrocycles, choosing a large cyclocarbon with a low level of strain, and developing mild reaction conditions for the unmasking step in the reaction (where a precursor molecule is transformed into the final product).

The cyclocarbon catenane was characterised by mass spectrometry, NMR, UV-visible and Raman spectroscopy. The observation of a single intense 13C NMR resonance for all 48 sp1 carbon atoms indicates that all of the carbons are in equivalent environments, which provides strong evidence for the cyclocarbon catenane structure.

Lead author Dr Yueze Gao (Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford) said: ""Achieving stable cyclocarbons in a vial at ambient conditions is a fundamental step. This will make it easier to study their reactivity and properties under normal laboratory conditions.""

Study senior author Professor Harry Andersen (Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford) said: ""This achievement marks the culmination of a long endeavour to synthesise cyclocarbon catenanes, based on the hope that they might be stable enough to study at room temperature. The original grant proposal was written in 2016, based on preliminary results from 2012-2015. It is satisfying to have reached this point, because there were many times when the goal seemed unrealistic and unachievable. This work would not have been possible without the outstanding facilities for NMR spectroscopy in the Department of Chemistry at Oxford.""

The study also involved researchers from the University of Manchester, the University of Bristol and the Central Laser Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

Researchers in Japan have genetically transferred a unique courtship behavior from one fruit fly species to another. By turning on a single gene in insulin-producing neurons, the team successfully made a species of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) perform a gift-giving ritual it had never done before. The study, published in the journal Science, represents the first example of manipulating a single gene to create new neural connections and transfer behavior between species.

In nature, most male fruit flies court mates by rapidly vibrating their wings to create sound patterns or ""courtship songs."" However, Drosophila subobscura has evolved a very different strategy: males regurgitate food and offer it as a gift to females during courtship. This behavior does not exist in closely related species such as D. melanogaster.

These two fruit fly species diverged about 30-35 million years ago. Both have a gene called ""fruitless"" or ""fru"" that controls courtship behavior in males, but they use different strategies -- one species sings and the other gives gifts. The researchers found the reason for this difference: in gift-giving flies (D. subobscura) insulin-producing neurons are connected to the courtship control center in the brain, while in singing flies (D. melanogaster) these cells remain disconnected.

""When we activated the fru gene in insulin-producing neurons of singing flies to produce FruM proteins, the cells grew long neural projections and connected to the courtship center in the brain, creating new brain circuits that produce gift-giving behavior in D. melanogaster for the first time,"" Dr. Ryoya Tanaka, co-lead author and lecturer at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Science, explained.

The researchers inserted DNA into D. subobscura embryos to create flies with heat-activated proteins in specific brain cells. They used heat to activate groups of these cells and compared the brains of flies that did and did not regurgitate food. They identified 16-18 insulin-producing neurons that make the male-specific protein FruM, clustered in a part of the brain called the pars intercerebralis.

""Our findings indicate that the evolution of novel behaviors does not necessarily require the emergence of new neurons; instead, small-scale genetic rewiring in a few preexisting neurons can lead to behavioral diversification and, ultimately, contribute to species differentiation,"" Dr. Yusuke Hara, co-lead author from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), noted.

""We've shown how we can trace complex behaviors like nuptial gift-giving back to their genetic roots to understand how evolution creates entirely new strategies that help species survive and reproduce,"" senior author Dr. Daisuke Yamamoto from NICT said.

The study, ""Cross-species implementation of an innate courtship behavior by manipulation of the sex-determinant gene"" was published in the journal Science, on August 14, 2025, at DOI: 10.1126/science.adp5831. It represents the result of collaborative efforts led by Drs. Yusuke Hara and Daisuke Yamamoto at the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), in partnership with researchers at Nagoya University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Trojan horse bacteria sneak cancer-killing viruses into tumors","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250816113522.htm","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:34:32 GMT","

Researchers at Columbia Engineering have built a cancer therapy that makes bacteria and viruses work as a team. In a study published recently in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the Synthetic Biological Systems Lab shows how their system hides a virus inside a tumor-seeking bacterium, smuggles it past the immune system, and unleashes it inside cancerous tumors.

The new platform combines the bacteria's tendency to find and attack tumors with the virus's natural preference for infecting and killing cancerous cells. Tal Danino, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia Engineering, led the team's effort to create the system, which is called CAPPSID (short for Coordinated Activity of Prokaryote and Picornavirus for Safe Intracellular Delivery). Charles M. Rice, an expert in virology at The Rockefeller University, collaborated with the Columbia team.

""We aimed to enhance bacterial cancer therapy by enabling the bacteria to deliver and activate a therapeutic virus directly inside tumor cells, while engineering safeguards to limit viral spread outside the tumor,"" says co-lead author Jonathan Pabón, an MD/PhD candidate at Columbia.

The researchers believe that this technology -- validated in mice -- represents the first example of directly engineered cooperation between bacteria and cancer-targeting viruses.

The approach combines the bacteria's instinct for homing in on tumors with a virus's knack for infecting and killing cancer cells. ""By bridging bacterial engineering with synthetic virology, our goal is to open a path toward multi-organism therapies that can accomplish far more than any single microbe could achieve alone,"" says Zakary S. Singer, a co-lead author and former postdoctoral researcher in Tal Danino's lab.

""This is probably our most technically advanced and novel platform to date,"" says Danino, who is also affiliated with the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Columbia's Data Science Institute.

Sneaking past the immune system

One of the biggest hurdles in oncolytic virus therapy is the body's own defense system. If a patient has antibodies against the virus -- from a prior infection or vaccination -- those antibodies can neutralize it before it reaches a tumor. The Columbia team sidestepped that problem by tucking the virus inside tumor-seeking bacteria.

""The bacteria act as an invisibility cloak, hiding the virus from circulating antibodies, and ferrying the virus to where it is needed,"" Singer says.

Pabón says this strategy is especially important for viruses that people are already exposed to in daily life.

""Our system demonstrates that bacteria can potentially be used to launch an oncolytic virus to treat solid tumors in patients who have developed immunity to these viruses,"" he says.

Targeting the tumor

The system's bacterial half is Salmonella typhimurium, a species that naturally migrates to the low-oxygen, nutrient-rich environment inside tumors. Once there, the bacteria invade cancer cells and release the virus directly into the tumor's interior.

""We programmed the bacteria to act as a Trojan horse by shuttling the viral RNA into tumors and then lyse themselves directly inside of cancer cells to release the viral genome, which could then spread between cancer cells,"" Singer says.

By exploiting the bacteria's tumor-homing instincts and the virus's ability to replicate inside cancer cells, the researchers created a delivery system that can penetrate the tumor and spread throughout it -- a challenge that has limited both bacteria- and virus-only approaches.

Safeguarding against runaway infections

A key concern with any live virus therapy is controlling its spread beyond the tumor. The team's system solved that problem with a molecular trick: making sure the virus couldn't spread without a molecule it can only get from the bacteria. Since the bacteria stay put in the tumor, this vital component (called a protease) isn't available anywhere else in the body.

""Spreadable viral particles could only form in the vicinity of bacteria, which are needed to provide special machinery essential for viral maturation in the engineered virus, providing a synthetic dependence between microbes,"" Singer says. That safeguard adds a second layer of control: even if the virus escapes the tumor, it won't spread in healthy tissue.

""It is systems like these -- specifically oriented towards enhancing the safety of these living therapies -- that will be essential for translating these advances into the clinic,"" Singer says.

Further research and clinical applications

This publication marks a significant step toward making this type of bacteria-virus system available for future clinical applications.

""As a physician-scientist, my goal is to bring living medicines into the clinic,"" Pabón says. ""Efforts toward clinical translation are currently underway to translate our technology out of the lab.""

Danino, Rice, Singer, and Pabón have filed a patent application (WO2024254419A2) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office related to this work.

Looking ahead, the team is testing the approach in a wider range of cancers, using different tumor types, mouse models, viruses, and payloads, with an eye to developing a ""toolkit"" of viral therapies that can sense and respond to specific conditions inside a cell. They are also evaluating how this system can be combined with strains of bacteria that have already demonstrated safety in clinical trials.

Think of Bluetooth trackers and safety in the past few years and your first thought might be the misuse of Apple AirTags and similar devices against women in domestic abuse and stalking cases.

Alongside collaborative initiatives to counter and shut down these malicious uses (such as the IETF's Detection of Unwanted Location Trackers, or DULT, standard), tracker makers themselves are flipping the script, turning tech that has been used to monitor women against their will into tech that protects them.

In mid-July, Seattle-based Pebblebee announced a new, free SOS safety feature, named Alert, for its $35 Clip Bluetooth tracker which, like the rest of its Universal line-up, can be set up with either Apple's Find My or Google's Find Hub networks, is made from around 30 percent recycled plastic and runs on a rechargeable battery, with 12+ months between USB-C charges.

When multi-pressed (six-plus presses), the Clip can trigger a siren alarm, flashing LED lights and automatically send an SMS text notification to one “Safety Circle” contact that you've pre-saved in the Pebblebee app.

It's simple to set up the contact in the app, and a long press on the device shuts off the siren and LEDs, though it's unlikely you'll fumble or accidentally set this one off. The Clip's siren isn't as loud and the lights don't cover as much radius as a dedicated personal alarm would, but they're enough to alert passersby when out walking at night. Plus, the Pebblebee website states: “The Alert functionality including the siren, strobe, and first Safety Circle contact is and will always be completely free.”

We tested out the SOS system and it worked without a hiccup. Our Safety Circle buddy received a text saying: “URGENT: Sophie activated a Pebblebee Alert. Please check in immediately” with a link to the correct location via Google Maps. Clicking the “Mark as safe” button in the app and/or long-pressing on the Clip sends a follow-up text to say “Sophie cancelled their Pebblebee Alert” with the last location link.

Now, however, Pebblebee is adding a paid-for subscription option, named Alert Live, which offers a Safety Circle of up to five contacts to receive the SOS text notification when triggered via the Clip, plus live location tracking for these contacts, for $3 a month or $26 a year. There's also a new Silent Mode, which sends the alert without the siren and LEDs, for both free and paid-for users: useful, though we haven't had the chance to test this or the new real-time location sharing out yet.

“Safety, specifically, has been on the roadmap, I'd say probably for three or four years, once we started implementing the DULT,” says Pebblebee's founder and CEO Daniel Daoura. “So ever since then, we've wanted to do it but we just didn't have the bandwidth and ability. We wanted to make sure we've established ourselves as a trustworthy and dependable company.”

The DULT specification, which is also supported by Apple, Google and the likes of Chipolo and is waiting on IETF ratification, is, says Daoura, “very close to being perfect.” Safeguards including the tracker devices buzzing or chiming so as not to go undetected, and notifications to the user being tracked without the need for a dedicated app are ideas the IETF is considering.

“The number-one priority is the safety of people, whether they're customers or not,” Daoura says. “We have received many reports from law enforcement, and we've provided feedback and told them exactly how to get the identification of the device so that they can go back to Apple or Google to trace the person that's misusing it.”

Kicking off this trend for adding personal safety alerts to trackers, Tile announced a similar SOS system for its 2024 line-up of trackers, which start at $25 for the Mate, last September. This comes with the ability to add up to 99 people to a Circle via integration with the Life360 app. (Though no more than 10 per Circle is recommended.)

Silent SOS alerts, via a triple-tap of a Tile tracker's button to trigger, are free for all Life360 users, with two days of location history. Its paid plans offer features like longer access to location history, unlimited “place alerts” for family and friends and emergency dispatch for $8, $15 or $25 a month.

On this competition with Tile, Daoura says that its SOS offering is “smarter, more intuitive, faster to use, and we're building more features that they've never even considered”, indicating that Pebblebee will add more personal safety-based functionality by the end of this year.

As for the ubiquitous Apple AirTag, a second gen is rumored to launch this September with an Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip and Vision Pro integration as well as, on the safety front, a tamper-proof, anti-stalking built-in speaker. But Daoura worries that Apple won't go further than this unless users apply pressure for the company to do so. “We know that it's not going to be blazing, crazy innovation, but we do know that people depend on Apple, they love the ecosystem,” he says.

As for its core item-tracking functionality, after CES demos of embedded Pebblebee “Pin” and “Plate” modules inside Kuma bikes and Peak skis in Las Vegas this January, and the launch of its scannable QR code Link Label stickers, Daoura thinks the future is a world of pre-tagged products. “We're embedding our tech into skis, bikes, golf gear, tools and many more items,"" he says. ""Imagine buying something and it's already trackable, no stickers, no dongles… that's where this is going.”

With this invisible, trackable future perhaps in mind, Pebblebee is also bolstering its approach to privacy and security. Daoura says privacy is the “default” not an add-on. Pebblebee does not have access to location data for finding items, location sharing to chosen friends and family via Alert only occurs when the user initiates it (and ends when the user marks themself as safe) and “we never sell any user data, unlike others, ever”. (Tile owner Life360 had previously sold precise user location data to up to a dozen data brokers, according to reporting from The Markup; it changed its data policy in 2022, shortly after it acquired Tile in late 2021.) “With the rise of AI language models,” he says, “data is really under threat and over the next year or two—we're going to see even more outbursts data scrubbing.”

As for how to potentially counteract this, Pebblebee is developing an “enhanced privacy layer”, set to be released via the app later this year or early next year, to protect your location and identity from being “scraped, sold or abused by anyone, even AI bots and trackers.” It seems trackers might be going beyond physical safety, and into providing peace of mind that your data and your identity is secure as well.

It's fun to think about the fundamental physical constants. These are special values used in our models of the physical universe. They include things like the speed of light, the gravitational constant, and Planck's constant, and they're “fundamental” in the sense that we can't derive them theoretically, we can only measure them.

We use these in solving physics problems all the time, so it's easy to take them for granted. But why are there such numbers in nature, and why do they just happen to have those specific values? Because, listen, if they were only slightly different, the universe might be incapable of supporting life. Did some cosmic clockmaker set these parameters? Isaac Newton thought so.

One of the most basic of these numbers is the electric constant, k. It's a value that lets us calculate the forces between electric charges. That's a big deal when you consider that all matter is made of just three things—electrons, neutrons, and protons, two of which have an electric charge. The interaction between electrons is what forms molecules to create you and everything around you. Otherwise it would all be just some undifferentiated soup.

But how do we know the value of the electric constant? Also, what does it have to do with other fundamental constants? And for that matter, is it really fundamental? Let's investigate.

When we say something has an electric charge, we mean it has a different number of protons and electrons. If your clothes dryer removes some electrons from your socks, they become positively charged. If they gain electrons, they'll be negatively charged. (Note: You can't take away protons, since they're in the nucleus of the atom. It would involve a nuclear reaction, which nobody wants.)

If you have two objects with opposite charges, they attract. If they have the same charge, they repel. Here's a demo you can do yourself: Take a piece of clear tape and place it on a smooth table. Then put a second piece on top of that one, and pull them off together. Now, if you separate them, one will be positive and one will be negative; hold them in proximity and they will bend toward each other.

If you repeat the process, you'll have two positive and two negative tapes. Hold two with similar charges near each other, and you'll see that they repel, like in the picture below:

The smaller the distance between the tapes, the greater the repelling force. If you increase the charge on either (or both) tapes, the force will also get stronger. In 1785, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb modeled this electrostatic force, so we call it Coulomb's law. This is a famous equation that every chemistry and physics student learns. It looks like this:

Here two objects are separated by a distance r. The values of their charges are q1 and q2 in units of, well, coulombs. In order to get the force in newtons, the standard unit for measuring a force (F), we need a constant of proportionality—that's k—the electric constant, also known as Coulomb's constant. In these units it has a value of k = 8.987 x 109 nm2/C2 (newton-meters squared per coulomb squared … don't worry about it).

That's a big number, and it shows how strong electric interactions are—much stronger, in fact, than gravitational interactions. Surprised? It's not something you notice, because all objects contain both positive and negative charges at the molecular level, so they have a roughly equal number of attractive and repulsive forces that mostly cancel. The gravitational interaction that keeps you pinned to the Earth is more obvious because it involves only an attractive force (you can't have negative mass), and because we are puny specks on a giant rock.

To come up with this, Coulomb made an instrument called a torsion balance. It had a thin horizontal rod hanging from a fiber so it could rotate freely—all contained in a glass cylinder to shield it from errant breezes. Then he had two small metal balls, one stationary and one on the end of the rod (plus a counterweight on the other end so it balanced).

He then gave the two balls similar charges so they repelled, and he measured the deflection of the rod. Then, to vary the charges, he took one ball and touched it to an identical but uncharged ball, cutting its charge in half, and he remeasured. The rod moved away half as far.

This showed that the electric force (F) was proportional to the product of the charges (q1q2). Then, by varying the distance between the balls he found that F was inversely proportional to the distance squared (r2). That meant, e.g., that an attractive force between two charges grows very fast as they get closer to each other (i.e., as r gets smaller).

But how did he find the magical number k? You won't like this answer, but Coulomb didn't know the value of Coulomb's constant—which meant he couldn't quantify the electric force (F). All he could say was that it was all proportional. His problem was that there was no way at the time to measure electrical charges. There were no coulombs in Coulomb's day.

But by running similar experiments over time, later scientists gradually zeroed in on the value of the electric constant, which we now know is k = 8.987 x 109 nm2/C2.

We could stop there, but hey, science never stops. You know that. It turns out there's another constant that is related to Coulomb's constant. We call it the “permittivity of free space” (ε0), which sure sounds like fun. It tells us how hard it is to create an electric field in a vacuum. A smaller ε0 , or lower permittivity, would mean you'd get a greater electric field from the same charge. Yes, that seems backwards, but it's just how they defined it. It's too late to change.

Is there a permittivity value for nonempty space too? Yup. We call that the dielectric permittivity (ε), and it depends on the type of material. For example, it's harder to generate an electric field in water than it is in glass, so water has a higher ε.

With this permittivity constant, we can rewrite Coulomb's law as the following:

All I've done is replace k with ¼πε0, where ε0 = 8.854 x 10–12 C2/(nm2). That might seem like a pointless digression. But this enables us to do something pretty wonderful: We can create relationships with other fundamental constants. In particular, there's a very cool relationship between permittivity (ε0 )and the speed of light (c).

Here, the Greek letter mu, μ0, is the magnetic constant, aka the permeability of free space. I'm going to do a whole other piece next week on this one, so stay tuned. For now, suffice it to say that both constants are in there because light is an electromagnetic wave.

This relationship holds for non-empty space too, where light has to travel through a medium like, say, water. But both constants would be much higher, which means light would travel much slower in water.

Remember when I said up top that physics constants were “fundamental”—they couldn't be derived, only measured empirically? Well, as you can see, that wasn't entirely true. The equation above places a constraint on these three particular constants, so we only need to measure two of them, and then we can compute the third. If we know the speed of light and the permeability, we can derive the permittivity and by extension the electric constant, k.

I know that sounds crazy, but at some point you have to realize that all of our units and constants are arbitrary. We have to pick some place to start finding values and then build our units like a house of cards. If you change one of them, the whole thing comes crashing down.

The Camp Snap CS-8 doesn't care about frame rates, bit rates, or whether your footage is stabilized to unerring levels of steadiness. It doesn't want to replace your iPhone or compete with your mirrorless camera setup. What it offers instead is something far simpler and more deliberate: the feeling of shooting video for the sake of it.

Much like Camp Snap's point-and-shoot still camera from 2023 (the company's only other major product), it's a throwback to when cameras didn't think for you and when you didn't expect to review the images you just captured until later—sometimes much later.

Inspired by the Super 8 camcorders introduced in the 1960s, the CS-8 is unapologetically retro in both appearance and function. The body is mostly plastic, with faux-metal detailing and leatherette texture meant to evoke the mechanical era rather than mimic it convincingly. It's chunky and solid in the hand, albeit in a distinctly toylike way. If you're looking for authenticity, you're not going to find it here: There's a fake cold shoe up top and imitation screws at the base of the pistol grip. But that's not the point—this isn't Kodak's $5,000 Super 8 revival but rather a $199 camera meant to live in the real world and get passed around at parties, slung into backpacks for day trips, and used without a second thought.

There's no screen, no playback, and no Delete button. Here, what you shoot is what you get. The settings and options are stripped back, with one dial for selecting aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, 1:1, or 9:16) and another for the video effect. These include standard color, monochrome, and three lo-fi filters, including one that simulates the grainy, jerky look of 8-mm film.

I found that last one, labeled Analogue, was the star of the show. It drops the frame rate to 20 fps (it's 30 fps with the other modes) and sprinkles in digital scratches, resulting in footage that's imperfect in the most deliberate way. The rest of the filters feel a little flat by comparison, though the monochrome setting can conjure up its own punchy charm in the right lighting.

Using the CS-8 is refreshingly physical: Power it on by flicking a dial, press your eye to the rubber-cupped viewfinder, and squeeze down the trigger to record. There's no focusing to worry about here. The 8X zoom is handled with buttons labelled “W” and “T” for wide and telephoto, though it's digital-only, and resolution drops off quickly when you push in too far.

The viewfinder shows an appropriately cropped preview along with battery status, but it's not especially friendly to anyone who wears glasses. If, like me, you use specs, expect to see only part of the frame unless you're squeezed up uncomfortably tight. It's not a deal-breaker, but I did find it a constant irritation rather than part of the uncompromising retro charm.

Recording with the CS-8 feels more intentional than it does with a smartphone or a modern point-and-shoot camera. Here, you can't be distracted by the footage you just shot, because you can't see it until you get home. You can't delete it until you get home, either. There's no temptation to reshoot the same five seconds 10 times in search of something “perfect.” Simply shoot your scene, then move on. It's a welcome break from videoing something on your phone, then immediately checking to make sure it looks right; here, you feel like you're capturing a moment rather than curating one.

Storage is quite limited out of the box, but expandable. There's a 4-GB microSD card tucked behind a panel, which'll get you about 30 minutes of footage. Swap it out for something larger (up to 128 GB is supported) and you're good for up to 16 hours. Battery life offers roughly 30 minutes of continuous recording, and the camera charges via USB-C.

There's no wireless connectivity, no app, and no overcomplicated companion software to worry about; getting files off the camera means plugging it in and dragging them over to your computer. It might have been nice to have some built-in way to join all your clips into a single, shareable file, but I found it easy enough to do so using DaVinci Resolve.

Image quality is, predictably, not going to compete with a modern-day mirrorless camera or even a midrange smartphone. Videos max out at 2880 x 2144 resolution at 30 fps, but the bitrate is low, stabilization is nonexistent, and the mono audio is functional at best. You'll also hear the distinct sound of the trigger being pulled in almost every clip, reminding you that this is a camera with mechanical quirks, not a precision tool polished to perfection. The CS-8 captures exactly the kind of video you'd expect—it's not clean, smooth, or cinematic, but it's got character.

And character is the point. The CS-8 doesn't set out to be “good” in the traditional sense. Rather than promising professional results, it's designed to be fun. For kids, it's an easy introduction to video without the distracting noise and clutter of modern camera features. For adults, it's a throwback to a simpler time, encouraging creativity over quality. Its flaws are largely in service of the camera's philosophy. It wants you to treat video as something casual and spontaneous, not something to fuss over or optimize. And that approach can be surprisingly freeing.

Priced at $199 (early adopters can grab it for $149), the CS-8 sits in a strange but appealing niche. It's far from a necessity—you already have a smartphone in your pocket capable of outperforming it. But it knows exactly what it is: a playful and nostalgia-drenched tool for making memories that feel like memories the second they're captured. You don't buy this camera to create “content;” you buy it to capture moments without overthinking the whole process.

In that regard, the Camp Snap CS-8 is a success. It's not a video camera that'll appeal to everyone, but for those who can fully get on board with what it's going for, it's worth the price.

It's about 10 minutes into my interview with Mike Macdonald, and I get the sense that the Seattle Seahawks head coach is a little geeky. 

“Geek is a compliment,” he said. “I've been called a football nerd.”

Macdonald, 38, became the NFL's youngest head coach when he joined the Seahawks last year. He was also a straight-A student in high school and graduated summa cum laude with a finance degree from University of Georgia.

So it's not a big surprise that Macdonald embraces innovative tools and strategies. 

In an interview with GeekWire earlier this year at Lumen Field, Macdonald described his approach as a hybrid of traditional football fundamentals and modern technology. 

“We have a philosophy in Seattle: old school principals, new school methods,” he said. “We're going to build on a strong foundation, but whatever we can do to give us an edge — we're going to get after it.”

Thanks to advanced tracking and analytics, NFL teams have more data than ever — and it's changing how the game is played. One clear example: how coaches approach fourth down decisions.

“We have a way to measure the advantage you get for going for it on fourth down,” Macdonald said. “Every team has that.”

That data can shift play-calling not just on fourth down but throughout an entire drive, Macdonald said. 

Macdonald doesn't see analytics and instinct as mutually exclusive — instead, he views data as a decision-making tool to support what coaches already know from film, practice, and experience.

“It's a constant balance,” he said.

We spoke to Macdonald as part of an event showcasing Microsoft's partnership with the NFL, which now includes use of the company's Copilot AI software for scouting, allowing teams to get immediate insights by simply asking questions versus waiting for analysts to crunch spreadsheets.

“Earlier information is better,” Macdonald said. 

Macdonald, who was previously the Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator, last year became the first coach in franchise history to reach 10 wins in his first season. He'll try to top that mark as the Seahawks kick off their 2025 season next month.

We ended our chat with a little quick-hit Q&A.

Mac or PC? “I had a PC in college. I switched to Mac. But ever since I've been working in football, I've been on a PC.”

Favorite video game: “Madden. I've stopped playing the last couple years, but I love Madden. Loved NCAA back in the day. MVP Baseball 2005 was a great game.”

Favorite app: “Text message app. I get more text messages now, holy smokes.”

What should GeekWire readers know about you? “I'm an open book on this stuff. I think it's cool to be into stuff that is high-tech, data-driven. You're telling me you're smart and you're trying to find edges and trying to find new frontier — that's cool to me. It sounds like a winning formula.”

While Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was loudly criticized this year after declaring that Duolingo would become an “AI-first company,” he suggested in a new interview the real issue was that he “did not give enough context.”

“Internally, this was not controversial,” von Ahn told The New York Times. “Externally, as a publicly traded company some people assume that it's just for profit. Or that we're trying to lay off humans. And that was not the intent at all.”

On the contrary, von Ahn said the company has “never laid off any full-time employees” and has no intention of doing so. And while he didn't deny that Duolingo had cut its contractor workforce, he suggested that “from the beginning … our contractor workforce has gone up and down depending on needs.”

Despite the criticism (which does not seem to have made a big impact on Duolingo's bottom line), von Ahn still sounds extremely bullish about A.I.'s potential, with Duolingo team members taking every Friday morning to experiment with the technology.

“It's a bad acronym, f-r-A-I-days,” he said. “I don't know how to pronounce it.”

The industry needs to separate those separate inquiries, and introduce a clearer way to catalog the direct functional impact of gene variants irrespective of big-impact pathologies. For example, knowing a gene variant reduces dopamine recycling 15% is interesting and useful and completely separate from whether low dopamine recycling is clinically harmless, pathological or unknown. Such a gene is not an unknown quantity, and the current reporting protocols conflate and confuse these important topics.

To me these changes are more important than the pathological ones. But they're just not as sexy and the risks of suffering pathology from these is dependent, not only on the jeans, but also on the environment.For example, you can look at the polymorphisms and the fatty acid desaturate genes and know that your diet can impact your long-term health because of the way you process poly unsaturated fatty acids.As for your dopamine example, what does this mean if someone is deficient in B6 or iron which help make dopamine? Isn't that more important for this person? And what if this person drinks too much? Does that make them more prone to addiction? These are the things that affect every day people and make their lives better and understanding the risks that are associated with their genetics.By the way, I'm a success story about modern genetics. I've discovered that my family carries mutation in the CBS gene (D270N), that does not allow P5P to attach to the enzyme correctly, leading us to have a functional B6 deficiency and the host of issues.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here.

Diplomats from around the world concluded nine days of talks in Geneva — plus a marathon overnight session that lasted into the early hours of Friday — with no agreement on a global plastics treaty.

During a closing plenary that started on Friday at 6:30 a.m. — more than 15 hours after it was originally scheduled to begin — nearly all countries opposed an updated draft of the United Nations treaty that was put forward by the negotiating committee chair, the Ecuadorian diplomat Luis Vayas Valdivieso. Many of the delegates said the text did not reflect their mandate under a U.N. Environment Assembly resolution to “end plastic pollution” by addressing the “full life cycle” of plastics.

“We are truly sad to say that we will not have a treaty to end plastic pollution here in Geneva,” the head negotiator for Norway, Andreas Bjelland Erikse, told the chair. Valdivieso wrapped up the meeting just after 9 a.m. with the promise that they would continue at a later date.

The decision ends a contentious week and a half of discussions during the “resumed” fifth session of negotiations over a United Nations plastics treaty, which started in Geneva on August 4. Delegates had arrived in the city hoping to finalize a treaty by Thursday, having already overrun their original deadline to complete the agreement by the end of 2024.

Signs of a logjam were apparent even within the first few days of the talks, however, as countries hewed to the same red lines they'd stuck to during previous negotiations. A so-called “like-minded group” of oil-producing countries said it would not accept legally binding obligations and opposed a wide range of provisions that other nations said were essential, including controls on new plastic production, as well as mandatory disclosures and phaseouts of hazardous chemicals used in plastics.

During a plenary on August 9, three observers independently told Grist that the negotiations felt like “Groundhog Day,” as countries reiterated familiar talking points. A norm around consensus-based decision-making discouraged compromise from all countries, though the like-minded group — which includes Bahrain, Iran, and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, among other countries — was particularly intransigent and understood it could simply block proposals rather than shift its positions. Instead of whittling down a draft of the treaty that had been prepared late last year during the previous meeting in Busan, South Korea, delegates added hundreds of suggestions to it, placing a deal further from reach.

Over the course of the Geneva talks, delegates rejected two new drafts of the treaty prepared by Valdivieso: one released on Wednesday, which was so objectionable that countries said it was “repulsive” and lacked “any demonstrable value;” and the most recent one published just hours before Friday's 6:30 a.m. plenary. Many expressed their preference to revert back to the Busan draft as a basis for future discussions.

Despite Friday's outcome, the plastics treaty does not yet appear to be dead. Virtually all countries expressed an interest in continued negotiations — the European Union delegate Jessika Roswall said she would not accept “a stillborn treaty” — and many used their mic time during the closing plenary to remind others of what's at stake.

“We cannot ignore the gravity of the situation,” a negotiator from Madagascar said. “Every day, our oceans and ecosystems and communities are suffering from the consequences of our inability to make decisive and unified actions.” Tuvalu's delegate, Pepetua Election Latasi, said failing to enact a treaty means that “millions of tons of plastic waste will continue to be dumped in our oceans, affecting our ecosystem, food security, livelihoods, and culture.”

Still, without a change in the negotiations' format — particularly around decision-making — it's unclear whether further discussions will be fruitful. The norm around “consensus-based decision-making” means the threat of a vote can't be used to nudge obstinate countries away from their red lines; unless decision-making by a majority vote is introduced then this dynamic is unlikely to change. “This meeting proved that consensus is dead,” said Bjorn Beeler, executive director of the International Pollutants Elimination Network, a coalition of health and environmental organizations. “The problem is not going away.”

Procedural rules for the plastics treaty negotiations say that, for substantive issues, delegates “shall make every effort” to reach agreement by consensus. Otherwise they can vote by a two-thirds majority, but only as a “last resort.”

When delegates sought to clarify these rules during the second round of talks in 2023, there was so much disagreement that it sank several days of negotiation. The result is that delegates have defaulted to consensus for everything, fearful of broaching the subject and losing even more of their limited negotiating time.

Yet consensus-based decision-making is also one of the main reasons that the negotiations have gone so slowly: Oil-producing countries have used these rules to their advantage to either stall or water down interim agreements at each round of negotiations, frustrating progress even when they're greatly outnumbered.

Other nonprofits and advocacy groups staged several silent protests during the Geneva talks raising this same point, displaying signs reading, “Consensus kills ambition.” 

Senimili Nakora, one of Fiji's delegates, said during the closing plenary that “consensus is worth seeking if it moves us forward, not if it stalls the process.” Switzerland's negotiator, Felix Wertli, said that “this process needs a timeout,” and that “another similar meeting may not bring the breakthrough and ambition that is needed.”

Other countries raised broader concerns about “the process” by which negotiations had proceeded. Meetings had been “nontransparent,” “opaque,” and “ambiguous,” they said during the plenary, likely referring to unclear instructions they had received from the secretariat, the bureaucratic body that organizes the negotiations.

Inger Andersen, the U.N. Environment Programme's executive director, told reporters on Friday that it at least had been helpful to hear countries more clearly articulate their red lines. “Everyone has to understand that this work will not stop, because plastic pollution will not stop.”

The plastics industry, which has opposed controlling plastic production and phasing out groups of hazardous chemicals, said it would continue to back a treaty that “keeps plastics in the economy and out of the environment.” Marco Mensink, council secretary of the International Council of Chemical Associations, said in a statement: “While not concluding a global agreement to end plastic pollution is a missed opportunity, we will continue to support efforts to reach an agreement that works for all nations and can be implemented effectively.”

Environmental groups, scientists, and frontline organizations were disappointed to leave Geneva without an ambitious treaty. They said it would have been worse, however, if countries had decided to compromise on key provisions such as human health and a “just transition” for those most likely to be affected by changes to global recycling and waste management policies, including waste pickers.

Under the circumstances, they applauded delegates for not agreeing to the final version of the chair's text. “I'm so happy that a strong treaty was prioritized over a weak treaty,” said Jo Banner, co-founder of the U.S.-based organization The Descendants Project, which advocates to preserve the health and culture of the descendants of enslaved Black people in of a swath of Louisiana studded by petrochemical facilities

“It feels like our voices have been heard,” added Cheyenne Rendon, a senior policy officer for the U.S. nonprofit Society of Native Nations, which has advocated that the treaty include specific language on Indigenous peoples' rights and the use of Indigenous science.

By contrast, observers' voices were literally not heard during the final moments of the concluding plenary in Geneva. After more than two hours of statements from national delegations, Valdivieso turned the mic over to a parade of young attendees, Indigenous peoples, waste pickers, and and others who had been present throughout the week and a half of talks. But only one speaker — from the Youth Plastic Action Network — was able to give a statement before the United States and Kuwait asked the chair to cut them off and conclude the meeting.

It is now up to the plastics treaty secretariat to set a date and time for another round of negotiations, which are not likely to happen until next year. In the meantime, all eyes will be on the U.N. Environment Assembly meeting in December, where Andersen is expected to deliver a report on the negotiations' progress — or lack thereof — and which could present an opportunity for the like-minded countries to lower the ambition of the treaty's mandate: the statement spelling out what the treaty is trying to achieve. Some environmental groups fear that Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others will try to change the mandate so that it no longer refers to the “full life cycle” of plastics, but just plastic pollution — thus turning the treaty into a waste management agreement rather than one that addresses the full suite of plastics' harms to health and the environment, including during the material's production.

Banner said she doesn't feel defeated; in fact, she's “more passionate than ever” to keep fighting for legally binding restrictions on the amount of plastic the world makes.

“I'm planning to survive,” she added, and to do that, “we have got to stop the production of plastic.”

Update, 8/17/2025 @ 10:57 AM: After his old Twitter posts were discovered, Bloodshot writer Mauro Mantella has since deleted the account and posted an apology on Instagram.

“I want to offer my most sincere apologies. I know I made a mistake, but at no point did I intend to spread a message of hate,” it begins. In his apology, he revealed he first wrote the issue's script in Spanish, then “changed it a bit” when converting it to English. This conversion led to him “borrowing a common phrase used by haters and tried to adapt it to the fictional world of vampires I was building. But now I see that it was understood in a completely different way.”

Mantella continued with an urge for readers to believe his subconscious “betrayed me when I tried to make a sharp comment,” and that he was “always referring to this fictional world where vampires force their children into eternal life without their consent.” He also revealed the second issue will provide “consequences” for this narrative choice and continue to strictly be about “the fictional context of the story I wrote.”

As for his past social media posts, he called himself a fan of conspiracy theories, which he uses for story fuel because it's “fascinating and inspiring.” He is committing to being “more careful and serious about what I share and write,” and stressed his stories contain a “humanist, conciliatory approach — one that focuses on people, not on conflict or on judging anyone.”

Mantella affirmed his views as “center/left-thinking,” which he says makes him a “peronista” in Argentina, and called it “painful” to be regarded as alt-right. He swore has no right-wing inclinations or support for fascism, and is “very sad and ashamed to be in the middle of this situation, and I acknowledge my mistake. This has been a lesson for me, and I will do everything I can to make amends.”

Original story: Earlier this week, comic book publisher Valiant continued its recent “Beyond” reboot with Bloodshot #1. Shortly after its release, readers noted the comic—written by Mauro Mantella with art by Fernando Heinz Furukawa—contained narration that felt like a pointed jab at transgender people.

In the panels below from the issue, Bloodshot muses about his struggles against vampires and how the Yakuza have worked with the local government to “normalize blood consumption, and that's messing with the minds of the younger ones. […] There are kids who want to be bitten to become vampires because their favorite influencer says they're one. And parents who force their children into that irreversible change just to feel modern, and believing that they'll be thankful for it when they grow up.”

The character's inner thoughts aren't that dissimilar to how transphobic people seem to think people begin to question their gender identity—the idea that trans people do it for kicks, or that they've been led astray by a particular person online who's spreading the message, particularly when it comes to kids. This thinking and desire to “protect our children” is what's led to so many anti-trans laws in the United States that prevent gender-affirming care, erase transgender people from American culture, and generally try to ensure that they are not allowed to exist in day-to-day public life or are put into incredibly dangerous and life-threatening situations.

Comics industry workers soon decried Bloodshot, leading to co-publisher Alien Books and Mantella's apology “for the harm caused by the phrasing in [the comic]. While the story takes place in a fictional world of vampires and cults, we understand that a specific line of dialogue has been read as alluding to real-world issues, specifically, the discrimination faced by trans people.”

“That was never the intention,” it continues. “The original line was written by an Argentinian creator and was unfortunately a case of nuance being lost in translation. We fully recognize that intent does not erase impact, especially when dealing with subject matter that affects real lives and communities.”

Alien will change the dialogue in the book's digital and collected editions and vowed to give scripts a “more intense review by our proof readers.” But the apology itself was undermined by pinning the blame on nuance being “lost in translation,” as many pointed out Mantella himself is a professional translator and has worked with U.S.-based comic publishers before, including DC Comics. Compounding the issue further is that Mantella's social media history is ridden with instances of him sharing right-wing and particularly anti-LGBTQ views. At the time of writing, several posts and shares from Mantella's online presence have been found, either still on his accounts or since deleted after they were recirculated online in the last few days, including previously retweeted jokes from an anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ Twitter account, similar memes espousing COVID-19 and vaccine denialism, as well as conspiracy theories surrounding Ukraine during its years-long war with Russia.

io9 has reached out to Alien for comment regarding Mantello's past social media behavior and will update when, or if, a response is given.

With less than a month to go before the Emmys, Disney's pulling out all the stops to make sure Andor takes home some gold. Not only did it recently release the script for “Welcome to the Rebellion,” one of its best season two episodes, it's also getting the word out through the power of the press.

As Disney describes it, the REBELIÓN zine celebrates “our 14 Emmy® nominations, the filmmakers, talent, and incredible craftspeople who were responsible for bringing this show to life,” and has already been sent out to press and voters. Per a now-deleted tweet, Los Angeles residents can pick up a copy at locations like Atwater Village's Secret Headquarters, Echo Park's Stories and Heavy Manners Zine Library, while everyone else can peep the digital version here.

Within its pages are the pitch of Andor's second season, propaganda posters featuring Cassian, Mon Mothma, and the Ghor, shots of key Empire characters, and concept art for the season. Showrunner Tony Gilroy also recently appeared at a pop-up event at West Hollywood's Kiosk-O-Thèque, which you can see below.

— Andor | A Star Wars Original Series (@andorofficial) August 16, 2025



REBELIÓN is some of the last Andor media we're likely to get; season two's likely getting a physical release, but the only other known work coming is the series' art book in May 2026. Anyone looking to understand the show on a writing level is out of luck, since Gilroy previously said there's no plans to publish the series' full scripts as a means of safeguarding the show against generative AI. Too bad this is physical version isn't for everyone.

The Emmys will air on Sunday, September 14, where we'll see if Andor takes home any gold for its last season.

But it has been pulled for now.

Valve's latest Steam Client Beta has upped the ante when it comes to GPU monitoring, claiming its in-game overlay now delivers more accurate utilization readings than Windows Task Manager. According to Valve, Task Manager has historically under-reported GPU usage, particularly for games that launch auxiliary processes alongside the main one. Steam's revamped overlay captures all these processes, trims sampling errors, and aligns its stats more closely with trusted third-party tools like MSI Afterburner.

The reason Task Manager can be inaccurate is that it measures GPU usage on a per-process basis and relies on the GPU driver to report statistics according to the WDDM specification. Games that split work across multiple processes can therefore have portions of their GPU activity missed, and certain workloads can appear less intensive than they actually are. By aggregating usage across all related processes, Steam's overlay provides a fuller and more precise picture of a game's GPU demands:

""Net effect should be that in most games it's nearly the same as before, but in certain situations we previously underreported overall GPU utilization and the utilization number will now be higher and should closer match third-party tools like MSI Afterburner.""



The quote above has since been removed from the patch notes page because Valve's confidence didn't last long under public scrutiny. Just a couple of days later, the beta update introducing this more accurate GPU tracking was quickly pulled from distribution. Now, the patch note reads: ""It was later re-released to roll back a GPU utilization monitoring change that needs more testing."" The inconsistency here suggests Valve is still validating the feature before pushing it stable, despite the bold messaging upfront.

This update follows earlier expansions to the overlay launched back in June, which introduced frame-level granularity like distinguishing between native frames and those generated by DLSS/FSR, alongside real-time readings of CPU load, RAM usage, clock speeds, and frame timing graphs. Those features have already transformed Steam's HUD into one of the most comprehensive in-game instruments—effectively matching tools like MangoHud and MSI's RivaTuner.

Combine that with the recently-added ability to display CPU temperature (on both Windows and Linux), enabled by a trusted CPUID-derived kernel driver, and it becomes clear: Valve is moving aggressively toward making the Steam overlay the central tech monitor for gamers, even if it means wading deeper into system-level access. This kind of behavior is commonplace in business today, where a dominant player will develop a homegrown version of something that was previously offered by a third party, essentially eliminating any need to venture outward.



That being said, gamers deeply invested in performance tuning, bottleneck diagnostics, and optimization, having accurate, server-less telemetry available via Steam—without relying on extra apps—could be a game-changer. It shifts hardware monitoring from niche third-party community tools into mainstream accessibility so newcomers and those less technically-inclined can also see the inner-workings of their computer, and more importantly, perhaps cultivate a new interest in it.

Still, users should tread carefully—especially when updating the GPU metrics which may still be unstable. Not to mention this is (was?) part of the beta client, meaning it's already early access and not meant for the general public. If it was pulled from even this channel then there's likely some serious tuning Valve is still experimenting with. But if the feature becomes widely available, in-game performance diagnostics just got a lot smarter for a lot more people.

Eye-catching London ad suggests our digital habits are ‘damaging the climate'","https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/is-wi-fi-bad-for-the-environment-eye-catching-london-ad-suggests-our-digital-habits-are-damaging-the-climate","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 12:15:00 GMT","

The ad seemingly says that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment, but its makers just want you to look closer.

A PhD student shared a photograph of an ad for the University of East London, implying that Wi-Fi is detrimental to the environment (h/t vx-underground). The poster says, “WiFi doesn't grow on trees. Your screen time is damaging the climate.” Although it's easy to assume that it's telling us that wireless networking is bad for the environment, a second look at the message focuses more on the time we spend in front of our phones, tablets, smart TVs, and computers, rather than on the Wi-Fi transmission itself.

.@AndyMasley you're desperately needed on the London tube!! pic.twitter.com/femGSAgxv0August 16, 2025

Its initial message was intended to catch the attention of the public, with the ad showing a link to the organization's ‘Think Again' campaign that challenges the status quo. If you visit that page, you'll see that one of the topics covered there is society's use of social media and how it's pushing data centers across the globe to produce more emissions than those generated by the global airline industry. It goes on to show how the University is driving research to make data centers more sustainable, reducing the negative impact of our use of social media on the environment.

The poster doesn't really say that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment — it only tells you that it doesn't grow on trees. University of East London's ad did gather the interest of the people who saw it, especially as it seemingly contradicted something that most of us know as fact — that Wi-Fi is safe. It's quite effective, too. However, this ad can be easily misunderstood by some people, especially conspiracy theorists who think wireless technology is dangerous (like 5G) and are encouraging everyone to start wearing tin foil hats.

Nevertheless, we did see some hilarious responses to vx-underground's post, including users who were thinking about how it would be possible to use a router to cause actual harm to the environment by building a massive router that puts out high-energy microwaves. There are also a few who wanted to determine the actual energy consumption of every Wi-Fi device plugged into the outlet across the U.K., and some who are pondering the actual physical weight of the data transmitted across the waves.

Let's just hope that this jet never goes rogue.

Defense startup SkyDefense LLC just launched an autonomous combat drone designed to take out enemy drone swarms at a much lower cost than traditional weapon systems. The company calls it the CobraJet — an uncrewed aerial vehicle (basically, a drone) designed for C-UAS (counter-unmanned aircraft system) missions. The drone combines Teledyne FLIR electro-optical and infrared sensors that do not contain restricted foreign parts, and Nvidia AI chips, allowing the drone to process the information that it sees with onboard sensors.

The CobraJet is also equipped with its proprietary Visual Realtime Area Monitoring (VRAM) system, allowing ground commanders to monitor the drone during autonomous operations and communicate with and control it, if needed. This gives its operator the option to let it operate on its own during reconnaissance, patrol, and identification, but still have a human making decisions when required. It can also use the same technology to communicate with other CobraJet units, allowing them to act together as a single entity to protect against enemy swarms.

Aside from its AI brain, the CobraJet also boasts an internal weapons bay and external hardpoints, allowing it to carry kamikaze drones, small missiles, or even fragmentation projectiles. It can also be modified to carry precision bombs and loitering munitions, making it a multirole drone. Its external design mimics that of the U.S.'s latest air superiority and multirole fighters, the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, with vertical take-off and landing capabilities and thrust vectoring nozzles. This means it can operate from the back of a truck and have improved maneuverability, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with small and nimble drones.

CobraJet is SkyDefense's solution to the emerging threat of drone swarms on the modern battlefield. These small and cheap weapons are widely used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the defending Ukrainians effectively using drones to initially counter the larger Russian army. Today, both sides in the conflict use UAVs, and actions on the battlefield highlight the U.S.'s need to develop a cost-effective counter.

While existing weapons like surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles can engage drones, there's often a huge mismatch in price between these two platforms. Missiles often cost between half a million to more than $4 million — while you can buy a cheap drone for just $200, with the more sophisticated ones, like Iran's Shahed-136, only costing $20,000. You can also send up a platoon of combat choppers to engage a drone swarm with guns, but you're risking several multi-million-dollar weapon platforms to combat cheap suicide drones.



“Our USA-made CobraJets can communicate and coordinate as a flight team, enabling them to operate as an AI-powered unmanned Air Force,” said SkyDefense LLC President Nick Verini. “This team approach increases the effectiveness of the squadron while also significantly reducing the costs of destroying a swarm of enemy drones.”

SkyDefense LLC hasn't released the unit cost of the CobraJet, but it's going to be so much more affordable than the fighter jets it looks like, and the missiles they carry. The company is offering the drone to law enforcement, Homeland Security, and the U.S. military, giving them the ability to protect against hostile drone swarms without needing to spend copious amounts of money to take down such cheap weapons.

Pop-up screening for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk held at community pharmacies and large-scale sporting events can identify people with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors, according to a study published in JACC, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology, and simultaneously presented at the 73rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.

ASCVD is the leading cause of death worldwide but is often preventable in many cases. Regular preventative screenings can identify modifiable risk factors like elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated body mass index (BMI) and smoking, but many people aren't participating in screenings or receiving recommended preventative care. Although preventative health checks have been shown to reduce rates of ASCVD, implementation on a large community scale has been limited.

Heart health checks in the community can identify risk factors for future heart disease that can be managed by lifestyle changes or early preventive medications and save lives down the road. We saw in this study that screening in a variety of places in the community not only works to identify risk but showed that different types of risk were more prevalent depending on screening location, screening day and screening time.""

Professor Stephen Nicholls, senior author of the study and director of the Victorian Heart Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia

In this study, researchers performed pop-up screenings at community pharmacies and an international cricket game to determine the number of participants who had uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors. Health stations were placed in 311 community pharmacies across Australia between Dec. 15, 2023 and Jan. 31, 2024. The health stations were available throughout the opening hours of each individual pharmacy, and screening performed before 5 p.m. was considered to take place during the daytime, while screening conducted after 5 p.m. was classified as evening. The health stations were also available for nine hours a day during an international cricket match played daily between Dec. 26-29, 2023. Screenings were performed as part of the Shane Warne Legacy Health Test initiative in memory of Shane Warne, an Australian cricket icon who suffered a premature and sudden death in 2022. The screening initiative was widely promoted to the public in advance.

Over 76,000 people were screened throughout the seven-week study period, with 89.8% screened at community pharmacies and 10.2% screened at the cricket match. Most participants were between 25 and 34 years old and male. Overall, 52,453 (68.9%) of participants met the primary outcome of having at least one uncontrolled risk factor: elevated BP reading, overweight or obese, or active smoker. Over one third (37.2%) of participants with recorded BP readings were in the hypertensive range.

There were higher rates of having at least one uncontrolled risk factor found among those screened at the cricket match vs. pharmacies. Most participants were between the ages of 35 and 64 years old and male. By individual risk factor, those at the cricket match had higher rates of elevated BP and BMI, but lower rates of smoking compared to those at pharmacies. About half of those with elevated BP readings had not had a BP check in the past year and over 80% were not on any antihypertensive medication.

At pharmacies, 24.3% were screened at rural pharmacies, where majority were over 45 years old and had higher self-reported rates of diabetes. Most screenings took place on weekdays in the evening. Compared to urban community pharmacies, those screened in rural pharmacies had higher rates of all risk factors and self-reported diabetes. About half of those with elevated BP readings had not had a BP check in the past year and almost 70% were not on any antihypertensive medications.

""Pop-up screening can be creatively nested into community-based programs and

events that are frequented by specific at-risk populations,"" Nicholls said. ""These could direct screening efforts towards populations that could stand to benefit the most from ASCVD risk reduction while concurrently addressing disparities in access to healthcare.""

It has been more than five years since Josh Sargent has scored a goal for the United States men's national team. But he couldn't be off to a hotter start for Norwich City in the EFL Championship after finding the back of the net against Portsmouth, potentially playing his way back into the national team picture.

Sargent has now scored goals in three consecutive matches to start the season for Norwich City. Leading the Canaries to a second consecutive victory, Sargent has become one of the best strikers in the English Championship, but with the World Cup looming, he has yet to make an appearance for the national team since March of 2025 in a loss during the Concacaf Nations League.

After Antonee Robinson and Christian Pulisic, Sargent is arguably the best-performing American for his club, and when looking at the 62 goals that he has scored for Werder Bremen and Norwich City, that is 10 more than Pulisic's 52 goals in that same span of time.

Even looking around the Championship, since the beginning of 2024, only Joel Piroe, Josh Brownhill, and Borja Sainz have scored more goals than Sargent's 17. With the national team, though, it hasn't translated, and the question is beginning to shift from will Sargent's scoring translate to the national team to why it isn't being prioritized.

Folarin Balogun, Patrick Agyemang, Ricardo Pepi, and Brian White have received the majority of starts under USA coach Mauricio Pochettino during his tenure so far, while Sargent has been left at home. With no one taking the reins for the starting striker role, it does make you wonder if Sargent will get another shot during the September international window. He has expressed that he wants to shine in a USMNT shirt, and Sargent also has a style that fits well with Pulisic in the attack.

Bringing plenty to a game, even when he's not scoring, he is being a menace while pressing and providing a strong aerial presence that works when his back is to the goal. That bore fruit when Sargent played with Borja Sainz at Norwich as alongside an inside forward on the left, Sargent can add assists to his goals.

If he's selected to face South Korea and Japan next month, it'll be another opportunity for Sargent to show what he can do, but the onus shouldn't just be on him. When looking at why a player's form from a club doesn't translate into the national team, sometimes it's about their specific performance, but other times, they warrant a change of the system to accommodate the player. With Sargent being one of the best American goal scorers over the past few years, there's no reason why Pochettino can't figure out what he has in a position of need. Sargent continues to do his part in putting the ball at the back of the net, and next, it needs to be done for the Red, White, and Blue.

Chelsea's Premier League campaign has begun with something of a whimper.

The FIFA Club World Cup champions looked under-prepared, a legacy surely of their summer exertions and late return to pre-season preparations, as Crystal Palace secured a point at Stamford Bridge. Enzo Maresca, a frustrated figure on the touchline, must have feared it might be like this.

With co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali watching on, Chelsea struggled for long periods to cope with Palace's aggressive approach. They might have trailed to Eberechi Eze's thunderous free kick early on, but the VAR determined Marc Guehi, grappling with Moises Caicedo in the penalty box, had moved within a metre of the Chelsea defensive wall when the shot was taken. The goal was therefore ruled out.

Chelsea's best first-half opportunity fell to Trevoh Chalobah, who skied over the bar from close range. The introduction of Estevao did inject some energy into their performance, but the forward players struggled to click and the better chances continued to fall to the visitors until stoppage time right at the end.

Then substitute Andrey Santos skied wastefully over the bar from inside the penalty box and with that effort went Chelsea's chance of a winning start.

Tim Spiers dissects the main talking points at a sun-drenched Stamford Bridge.

With Tosin Adarabioyo out injured and absent with a “small problem”, according to Maresca, teenager Josh Acheampong stepped up to fill Chelsea's Colwill-shaped hole.

Acheampong may have previously played a few games in the Conference League, started two Premier League games (including against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park last season) and even a Club World Cup group-stage appearance against Esperance, but this was surely the biggest game of his career; a chance on the opening day of the season to prove his worth and cement a place in the first XI.

He was handed a tough task against the intimidating, rampaging Jean-Philippe Mateta but, physically, the youngster held his own, staying tight to the Frenchman who only really unsettled him late in the second half.

Acheampong did look a little nervous early on — and one slack pass straight to Eze launched a Palace attack from which they won the free kick that led to their disallowed goal. He also played a careless ball across the defence in the second half that Palace almost capitalised upon.

However, Acheampong was by no means the only guilty offender here, with Reece James and Chalobah also playing misplaced passes as Palace's incessant press, applauded by Oliver Glasner, stifled Chelsea.

In that respect, they certainly missed Colwill. In fact, Chelsea arguably had more success when they went agriculturally long, with a couple of direct balls bypassing the press and getting them briskly on the attack.

Otherwise, Acheampong kept it pretty simple in possession. The highlight of his performance was undoubtedly an absolutely crunching challenge on Daniel Munoz after Mateta had sent the wing-back rampaging ominously down the right. It was a perfectly timed sliding tackle and then he was up on his feet to get to the loose ball ahead of Mateta.

The rabble-rousing moment brought Stamford Bridge to its feet.

Footballers need no excuse to make loud, vociferous appeals if they think they've been wronged in any way, but when Eze struck a thunderbolt of a free kick through both the Chelsea wall and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, it appeared to be a clean goal.

Eze and Palace celebrated wholeheartedly and Chelsea's players stood motionless, although their bench, led by set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva, were straight into the ear of the fourth official Michael Salisbury and it soon became clear why.

As Eze struck the ball, Guehi shoved Caicedo to one side, creating a gap through which Eze placed his shot.

However, the goal wasn't disallowed for a foul, as referee Darren England helpfully explained to the stadium in one of the new features of the 2025-26 season, saying: “After review, away No 6 is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.”

It turns out that, as of 2019, the laws of the game state that when three or more defending team players form a wall at a free kick, all attacking players must remain at least one metre from the wall until the ball is in play. So, quite correctly, no goal.

#CHECRY – 13' VAR OVERTURN

After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of goal to Crystal Palace.

Referee announcement: “After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a…

Chelsea both enjoyed and endured a mammoth season in 2024-25; it lasted 330 days and took in five competitions and 64 matches, starting on August 18 and ending on July 13.

Given how late it finished and that they have therefore had a truncated start to this season, starting pre-season training on August 4, 13 days before their Premier League opener, a lot of focus will be placed on how fatigued or fresh Maresca's players are throughout the campaign.

Conventional wisdom suggests they should be fine for now but may feel the impact later in the campaign, particularly if they go deep in the Champions League through a gruelling winter.

But there is no doub that this was a sluggish Chelsea display. They struggled to create chances, continuously ran down blind alleys and barely tested visiting goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

In fact, after the third minute, they failed to muster a solitary attempt on target until substitute Liam Delap's shot was saved in the 90th minute.

Credit should be given to Palace for the way they restricted space for the strangely subdued Cole Palmer, while Pedro Neto and debutant Jamie Gittens were often doubled up on by Palace defenders and rendered largely ineffective.

But Chelsea never found solutions to these issues. They enjoyed most of the play (around 70 per cent possession) but the tempo was far too passive and Palace found it easier to defend as the game went on.

So yes, Chelsea did look undercooked and lacking inspiration, but whether that was down to their Club World Cup exertions and a late start to pre-season, only they will know.

The one brief shining light of a flat and forgettable opening afternoon was the introduction of Estevao, who replaced Gittens in the 54th minute to a huge ovation.

A drab afternoon needed a lift and Estevao briefly provided it, skidding away from Guehi when he got his first chance to run at Palace's defence, before slamming a cross at Neto's head.

It was one of the game's best moments and the atmosphere was as loud as it had been all day.

The 18-year-old tried to give Chelsea what they needed; unpredictability and gusto. Not Malo Gusto, whose brainless 30-yarder into row Z in the 89th minute was met by howls of derision and summed up Chelsea's afternoon.

Estevao almost crowned his debut with a goal in front of Brazilian legend Romario, who was watching in the stands, but when meeting a cross in a great position he let the ball bounce off him before, off balance, blazing the ball over.

He also earned a very well deserved booking when wiping out Munoz as the Palace man looked to break. If orange cards were a thing, this was worthy of one.

Estevao certainly has the capacity to add excitement and thrills to Chelsea's play, as does his fellow Brazilian Joao Pedro, but in contrast this was a fairly forgettable Stamford Bridge bow for the former Brighton man. His struggles reflected those of the team as he often failed to find space and room to influence the game, often dropping off Guehi to link play but with nothing of note in front of goal.

Delap, in what could prove to be a familiar substitution this season, replaced Joao Pedro and was more unsettling for the Palace defenders, using his power and physicality to get into some great positions, but the finishing touch, as with all Chelsea's players, just wasn't there.

In fact, it was a third Brazilian, substitute Andrey Santos, who arguably had the game's best opportunity in stoppage time, a free shot just inside the box… but you could almost see what was going to happen when he took a big swing backwards of his left boot. Yep, miles over the bar.

It just wasn't Chelsea's day.

On whether Chelsea looked under-prepared: “I don't think so because, until the end, we competed. We tried to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao, with Andrey Santos. So that showed that probably we compete overall quite good. For sure, (Palace) have already played seven, eight games. And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes. So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better.”

On Acheampong's performance: “Very good, very good. We already showed confidence in Josh last year. He played already some games. Today he did very well, he dealt with Mateta very well. So overall, he did a good game.”

On Estevao's impact: “He was very good. He showed personality — he's already shown that in the training sessions. For sure, no doubt that slowly, slowly he will be a very important player for this club.”

New Chelsea signing Estevao came closest to snatching a winner, but the newly-crowned world champions were blunt in attack against a well-organised Palace defence.

Chelsea suffered a Club World Cup hangover as they were lucky to escape with a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace to open their Premier League campaign on Sunday (Aug 17). Palace were denied an early opener when Eberechi Eze's free-kick was ruled out by a VAR review for Marc Guehi obstructing the Chelsea wall. New Chelsea signing Estevao came closest to snatching a winner, but the newly-crowned world champions were blunt in attack against a well-organised Palace defence.

The Eagles' key duo, Guehi and Eze, started despite mounting speculation that the England internationals are set to join Liverpool and Tottenham, respectively. Eze thought he had opened the scoring with a blistering free-kick that had too much power for Robert Sanchez.

The goal was disallowed for Guehi's role in creating a gap by man-handling Moises Caicedo into the Chelsea wall.

Chelsea's demolition of European champions Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup last month had raised the Blues' hopes that they can

challenge for a first Premier League title since 2017.

Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro shone in the 3-0 win over PSG in New York 35 days ago, but were anonymous as Enzo Maresca had to turn to his bench for inspiration.

Estevao scored against Chelsea at the Club World Cup in his final game for Palmeiras. The Brazilian has been hyped as one of the world's brightest young talents, but lacked the composure to finish when he sliced high and wide from the middle of the box.

Nottingham Forest made light of manager Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-season fears with a dominant 3-1 win over a much-changed Brentford. Chris Wood struck twice, either side of Dan Ndyoe's debut goal for Forest, on a nightmare afternoon for new Brentford boss Keith Andrews. The Bees have lost their manager, captain and top scorer in the off-season.

Thomas Frank left to take charge of Tottenham, Mbeumo got his dream move to United, and Arsenal secured Christian Norgaard.

Yoane Wissa was also missing from the Brentford squad ahead of an expected move to Newcastle.

Igor Thiago's first goal for the club from the penalty spot late on was the only consolation for the visitors.

Arsenal, runners-up for the last three seasons, begin their quest for a first title in 22 years later away at a revamped Manchester United.

Chelsea's 2025–26 Premier League campaign got underway with a splutter as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.

The FIFA Club World Cup champions handed starts to new signings João Pedro and Jamie Gittens—the former given the nod over fellow new arrival Liam Delap—and teenager Josh Acheampong, who lined up alongside Trevoh Chalobah in central defence.

There was almost an early breakthrough for the Blues as Marc Cucurella's flicked header from Reece James's in-swinging corner was cleared off the line by Crystal Palace's Ismaïla Sarr, but ten minutes later it looked as if Chelsea had fallen behind.

A thunderous free-kick from Eberechi Eze. the in-demand attacking midfielder who is front and centre of Tottenham Hotspur's transfer radar, rocketed home from 20 yards out, bursting through the hands of goalkeeper Robert Sánchez.

But a little-known rule, infringed by Marc Guéhi, saw the goal ruled out, much to the delight of the vast majority inside Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea's response to the lift wasn't as you'd expect it to be. Enzo Maresca's side lacked any real cohesion, with Palace relatively comfortable throughout the remainder of the first half and for most of the second, and Jean-Philippe Mateta was denied by a smart save from Sánchez.

Estêvão was introduced ten minutes into the second half, replacing Gittens, and he had a big opportunity to open his Chelsea account soon after. The talented Brazilian couldn't control his effort, though, firing over the bar after Cole Palmer had managed to squeak a cross into Palace's penalty area.

Delap and Andrey Santos came off the bench too, making their Premier League debuts for the club, and the former was involved in creating a great chance for the latter in stoppage-time. Cucurella was also involved, squaring the ball for Santos after a tremendous touch from Delap, but he blazed his effort high over the bar to sum up the home side's afternoon.

The stalemate marked the first time in 2025 that Chelsea have failed to score at home, handing Palace a valuable point in what could turn out to be Eze's final appearance for the club.

The Kansas City area has hosted six of the last seven AFC Championship Games, the 2023 NFL Draft, two baseball All-Star Games and a pair of memorable World Series battles. However, none of those will compare to what awaits the region in 2026.

World Cup soccer is coming to North America and Arrowhead Stadium is one of 16 host cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The home of the Chiefs will serve as home to six World Cup matches from June 16-July 19, including a Round of 32 contest and a world quarterfinal.

“We've had a lot of construction going on at the sports complex this offseason,” Chiefs chairman and CEO Clark Hunt said during Friday's preseason game broadcast on KSHB. “With regard to Arrowhead, most of it was focused on getting the stadium ready for the World Cup next year.”

On Friday, the Chiefs will host the first of 10 games on their 2025 home slate when the Chicago Bears visit the stadium (7:20 p.m. CT, KSHB 41, 96.5 The Fan).

“We had to do a lot of surgery to the seating bowl,” Hunt said, “to make sure we have a wide-enough field. That work is complete and the Chiefs fans won't even notice that it happened.”

Residents will certainly know when the World Cup happens. Several hundred thousand soccer fans will visit Kansas City over the six-week period next summer. FIFA, the governing body that conducts the event, has called the 2026 World Cup the largest sporting event in world history. It's expected to pump more than $650 million into the Kansas City economy.

The Chiefs are grateful to play a central role.

“Well, first of all, I think it's absolutely incredible that Kansas City is one of the hosts,” Hunt said Friday. “We have six games, including a couple of knockout-round games. It's going to be probably the biggest event to ever come to Kansas City, and it's hard to say that given all the AFC Championship Games we've had, and the Royals playing in the World Series. 

“But there's nothing like the World Cup, and it's going to be an amazing opportunity for all of us who love Kansas City, to showcase our great city on the world's stage.”

Eleven NFL markets are hosting World Cup competition next summer and had to modify their stadiums in similar fashion, including the venue that hosted the Chiefs Friday night, Lumen Field in Seattle. 

Other hosts from the NFL are SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Houston's NRG Stadium, AT&T Stadium in Dallas, Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, Gillette Stadium in New England, MetLife Stadium in the New York City area, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field and Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area, which will welcome the World Cup just four months after hosting Super Bowl 60.

When the FIFA World Cup hits North America in June 2026, 48 teams and millions of soccer fans will be traveling to and from venues spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico.

It's a dramatic expansion – 16 more teams will be playing than in recent years, with a jump from 64 to 104 matches. The tournament is projected to bring in over US$10 billion in revenue. But the expansion will also mean a lot more travel and other activities that contribute to climate change.

The environmental impacts of giant sporting events like the World Cup create a complex paradox for an industry grappling with its future in a warming world.

Sports are undeniably experiencing the effects of climate change. Rising global temperatures are putting athletes' health at risk during summer heat waves and shortening winter sports seasons. Many of the 2026 World Cup venues often see heat waves in June and early July, when the tournament is scheduled.

There is a divide over how sports should respond.

Some athletes are speaking out for more sustainable choices and have called on lawmakers to take steps to limit climate-warming emissions. At the same time, the sport industry is growing and facing a constant push to increase revenue. The NCAA is also considering expanding its March Madness basketball tournaments from 68 teams currently to as many as 76.

Estimates for the 2026 World Cup show what large tournament expansions can mean for the climate. A report from Scientists for Global Responsibility estimates that the expanded World Cup could generate over 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, nearly double the average of the past four World Cups.

This massive increase – and the increase that would come if the NCAA basketball tournaments also expand – would primarily be driven by air travel as fans and players fly among event cities that are thousands of miles apart.

Sports are big business, and adding more matches to events like the World Cup and NCAA tournaments will likely lead to larger media rights contracts and greater gate receipts from more fans attending the events, boosting revenues. These are powerful financial incentives.



In the NCAA's case, there is another reason to consider a larger tournament: The House v. NCAA settlement opened the door for college athletic departments to share revenue with athletes, which will significantly increase costs for many college programs. More teams would mean more television revenue and, crucially, more revenue to be distributed to member NCAA institutions and their athletic conferences.

The inherent conflict between maximizing profit through growth and minimizing environmental footprint presents a dilemma for sports.

Several sport organizations have promised to reduce their impact on the climate, including signing up for initiatives like the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework.

However, as sports tournaments and exhibition games expand, it can become increasingly hard for sports organizations to meet their climate commitments. In some cases, groups making sustainability commitments have been accused of greenwashing, suggesting the goals are more about public relations than making genuine, measurable changes.

For example, FIFA's early claims that it would hold a “fully carbon-neutral” World Cup in Qatar in 2022 were challenged by a group of European countries that accused soccer's world governing body of underestimating emissions. The Swiss Fairness Commission, which monitors fairness in advertising, considered the complaints and determined that FIFA's claims could not be substantiated.

Aviation is often the biggest driver of emissions. A study that colleagues and I conducted on the NCAA men's basketball tournament found about 80% of its emissions were connected to travel. And that was after the NCAA began using the pod system, which is designed to keep teams closer to home for the first and second rounds.

Some academics, observing the rising emissions trend, have called for radical solutions like the end of commercialized sports or drastically limiting who can attend sporting events, with a focus on fans from the region.

These solutions are frankly not practical, in my view, nor do they align with other positive developments. The growing popularity of women's sports shows the challenge in limiting sports events – more games expands participation but adds to the industry's overall footprint.

Further compounding the challenges of reducing environmental impact is the amount of fan travel, which is outside the direct control of the sports organization or event organizers.



Many fans will follow their teams long distances, especially for mega-events like the World Cup or the NCAA tournament. During the men's World Cup in Russia in 2018, more than 840,000 fans traveled from other countries. The top countries by number of fans, after Russia, were China, the U.S., Mexico and Argentina.

There is an argument that distributed sporting events like March Madness or the World Cup can be better in some ways for local environments because they don't overwhelm a single city. However, merely spreading the impact does not necessarily reduce it, particularly when considering the effects on climate change.

Sport organizations and event planners can take steps to be more sustainable and also encourage more sustainable choices among fans. Fans can reduce their environmental impact in a variety of ways. For example:

Through all these options, it's clear that sports face a significant challenge in addressing their environmental impacts and encouraging fans to be more sustainable, while simultaneously trying to meet ambitious business and environmental targets.

In my view, a sustainable path forward will require strategic, yet genuine, commitment by the sports industry and its fans, and a willingness to prioritize long-term planetary health alongside economic gains – balancing the sport and sustainability.

VALENCIA, Spain - Japan attacker Takefusa Kubo began the World Cup season with a bang on Saturday after grabbing a goal in the Spanish La Liga opener, helping Real Sociedad secure a 1-1 draw at Valencia.

The 24-year-old drew his side level on the hour mark at Mestalla by hammering home a 20-meter drive into the bottom right corner, scoring in the league opener for the third time in four seasons at Sociedad.

""My feel for the ball was somewhat not good (in the game), but it's positive to start with a goal,"" Kubo said. ""There were lots of games I felt good playing but went without scoring last year, so I believe it's not a bad thing if I were to continue to have games like this.""

Diego Lopez had thrown his body to poke home a long ball from deep to give Valencia the lead only three minutes earlier. Kubo provided an instant response with his goal, creating space for himself off a Brais Mendez layoff before finding the net with a crisp strike.

""I had my mind set on taking a shot but taking that tiny touch threw both the defender and goalkeeper off their timing. It worked well,"" he said.

Sociedad are looking to improve on their 11th-place finish last term with Kubo, linked with a transfer away after the club sold many of their key players in recent years, seen as a focal point under new manager Sergio Francisco.

""I think it'd be best to build confidence (at Sociedad) and head into the World Cup in good shape, reaching my peak condition there.""

The England international had a forgettable day as the Blues' new wonderkid outshone his fellow new signings in a dull Premier League stalemate

Chelsea were brought back down to earth after their Club World Cup triumph with a goalless draw against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

The home side, who won the United States-based competition just last month, started on the front foot when Marc Cucurella's looping header was cleared off the line by Ismaila Sarr. 

Controversy reigned in the 13th minute when Eberechi Eze's piledriver free-kick was ruled out as referee Darren England ruled for an infringement, following a VAR review, against Marc Guehi.

After being beaten for pace for Eze's effort, Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez did well to spread himself to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta soon after, as Palace turned the screw. Although Chelsea struggled to seize control of the game, Trevoh Chalobah should have made it 1-0, only for the defender to sky his shot from six yards.

Substitute Estevao Willian provided a much-needed spark for the west London outfit, but Chelsea still found it very difficult to break down a well-organised Palace side. In the game's dying embers, Community Shield winners Palace looked the most likely to break the deadlock, with Eze unleashing a drive that stung the hands of Sanchez.

Liam Delap had half a chance to grab a late winner, but his effort was easily handled by 'keeper Dean Henderson, and soon after, fellow substituteAndre Santos spurned a big chance, too.

In the end, both teams settled for a point, but Enzo Maresca's team need to improve a great deal if they are to be considered as Premier League title challengers.

Terence Atmane's dream run at the Cincinnati Open has come to an end.

The Frenchman wowed peers and fans alike, defeating a host of high-profile names on his way to the semi-final stage.

Atmane, who also won two qualifying matches, defeated Flavio Cobolli, Joao Fonseca, Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune in Cincinnati.

His impressive run was halted by world number one Jannik Sinner, who won their contest 7-6 6-2.

However, the 23-year-old should be proud of his Cincinnati performance. Defeating the players he has takes talent and skill, not luck.

As expected, the Frenchman's ranking has skyrocketed following his performance in America, resulting in him overtaking a Grand Slam finalist.

Back in 2014, Kei Nishikori produced multiple displays of jaw-dropping tennis to reach the US Open final.

The Japanese star defeated Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic on his way to the final, before losing to ATP stalwart Marin Cilic in the final.

Since reaching the final, Nishikori has endured an unfortunate, extended period with injuries. During his career, the Japanese player has suffered from hip, ankle, knee, groin, and shoulder issues.

Nishikori has demonstrated incredible resilience to return to the top 100, after being ranked as low as 576 in 2023.

Before the Cincinnati Open, Nishikori was ranked 65 in the world. However, his first-round loss to Camilo Ugo Carabelli has seen him drop 23 places to world number 88, as per the ATP Live Rankings.

Meanwhile, Terence Atmane's ranking has increased dramatically. The Frenchman was ranked 136 in the world before the Cincinnati Open, but has since risen 67 places to world number 69.

Brad Gilbert, the former coach of Kei Nishikori, Andre Agassi and Andy Murray, took to social media to praise the 23-year-old Frenchman during his match against Jannik Sinner.

On X [Twitter], Gilbert said: “Throw the rankings out the window. Atmane is giving Sin City [Sinner]all he can handle.

“So cool to see this happen, and shows how deep tennis is at the moment.”

throw the rankings out the window 🪟 Atmane is giving Sin City 🌆 all he can handle, so cool 😎 to see this happen and shows how deep tennis 🎾 is atm

MASON, OH − The matchup most tennis fans wanted is here. 

The Cincinnati Open men's finals on Monday, Aug. 18 will be between the top 2 players in the world when Jannik Sinner meets Carlos Alcaraz on Center Court of the Lindner Family Tennis Center. 

In what has become the rivalry of a new generation of tennis phenoms, Alcaraz and Sinner's last four meetings were all in a tournament final. Last month, Sinner snapped a five-match losing streak to Alcaraz to become the first-ever Italian to win the Wimbledon men's singles title. 

It will be the fourth meeting this year between the two rivals after Alcaraz triumphed on clay at Roland Garros and Rome. 

The last time the ATP No. 1 and No. 2 met in the Cincinnati Open finals, it resulted in the longest (3 hours, 49 minutes) and arguably the best match in tournament history when Novak Djokovic beat Alcaraz in 2023. 

Overall, Alcaraz is 8-5 all-time against Sinner, including a 4-2 record on outdoor hard court. 

“I'm just really happy to be building such a great rivalry against Jannik (Sinner),” Alcaraz said in his pre-tournament press conference. “I think we've done great things in tennis in such a short period of time.” 

Here's how the ATP's top players advanced to the Cincinnati Open finals. 

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner will get a chance to defend his Rookwood Cup title.

In the Cincinnati Open semifinals Aug. 16, the ATP's top player defeated World No. 136 Terence Atmane on Center Court, 7-6 (4), 6-2.

On his 24th birthday, Sinner extended his hard-court winning streak to 26 consecutive matches and picked up his 200th tour-level win on the concreate (200-49).

""My mindset today was in a good spot,"" Sinner said after having Aug. 15 off. ""For my side, I'm very happy to be in a final again.""

Sinner, the reigning Cincinnati Open champion, will attempt to become the first back-to-back men's singles winner since Roger Federer (2014-2015).

Sinner's dominance was enough to end the Cincinnati Cinderella run of Atmane, who began the tournament as a qualifier. Atmane won seven matches in a nine-day stretch, including back-to-back upsets of ATP Top 10 seeds in No. 4 Taylor Frtiz and No. 9 Holger Rune.

""He (Atmane) has beaten incredible players throughout his (run) to the semifinals, so I knew I had to be very, very careful,"" Sinner said. ""He has huge, huge potential and I think we saw that throughout the tournament. I wish him all of the best.""

Atmane arrived in Mason with just five tour-level victories. He'll leave with 10, has doubled his year-to-date prize money and will crack the ATP Top 100 for the first time in his career.

Atmane was the first qualifier to reach the Cincinnati Open semifinals since 2015.

Atmane didn't go down without a fight against the World No. 1. The left-handed Frenchman landed 78% of his serves in the first set, notching six aces, to force a tiebreak, where Sinner would ultimately prevail.

Sinner took full advantage of the match with his first break in the fourth game of the second set to take a 3-1 advantage.

ATP No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz has a chance at redemption. 

Two years ago, Alcaraz was the No. 1 player in the world when he fell to Novak Djokovic in a marathon, three-set thriller on Center Court. 

After an upset Round of 32 loss last summer, Alcaraz is back in the Cincinnati Open finals for the second time after knocking out 2021 tournament champ and ATP No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev, 6-4, 6-3.

While Sinner has stayed at the ATP's summit for 61 weeks, Alcaraz has put together a storybook 2025 campaign with a tour-best 53 wins and five titles. He's now reached the final in seven consecutive tournaments after a second-round loss in Miami. 

Alcaraz, who entered 5-6 all-time against Zverev, got a key break in the first game to take a 4-3 lead, then held serve the rest of the way to win the first set. 

Despite Zverev landing 78% of his first serves and Alcaraz playing with more unforced errors (13 to 8), the Spaniard grabbed momentum and didn't let it go, capturing a tone-setting break to open the second set. 

Zverev, who battled illness in a win over Ben Shelton Aug. 15, needed medical attention during the second set after fighting back with a break to take a 2-1 lead. 

The two held serve until 3-3, when Alcaraz turned the match with another break at 4-3 and polished off the victory shortly after over Zverev, who struggled mightily to move efficiently after the medical timeout. 

""It was difficult. I think we started really well with good rallies and a good level of tennis. Then, all of a sudden, he started to feel bad,"" Alcaraz said. ""My focus was thinking about how he was feeling. It was a difficult situation for me and I just wish him all the best.""

Alcaraz has now won 16 consecutive matches at ATP Masters 1000 events and is 38-2 overall since the beginning of April. 

When he lines up against Sinner Aug. 18, it will be Alcaraz's 29 tour-level final and ninth at the ATP Masters 1000 level, with his lone loss coming against Djokovic in Cincinnati two years ago. 

""I'm really looking forward to playing him (Sinner) once again,"" Alcaraz said. ""For the people, I think it's great watching our matches because we raise our level to the top and we bring really beautiful tennis. I'm ready to take the challenge.""

The 2025 ATP Cincinnati Open final is set and pits world No. 1 Jannik Sinner against No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in a blockbuster showdown. It's going to be their 14th career meeting and fourth this season. This is their first final on a hard court, and they will give everything they have to win this high-stakes battle. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for the final, but which player will lift the trophy?

Head-to-Head: Sinner 5-8 Alcaraz

Defending champion Jannik Sinner had to battle hard in the first set of his semifinal match against the inspired Terence Atmane. Sinner stepped up his return when it mattered and got the job done. The Italian hasn't played at his absolute best this tournament, but he has won all five of his matches in straight sets, with his service getting broken only three times throughout the competition. However, he will need to bring his best to beat Carlos Alcaraz and extend his win streak to 13 matches.

Carlos Alcaraz's level has been up and down throughout the tournament, but he has managed to reach another final, his sixth in a row. He will look to get revenge on Sinner for the Wimbledon loss. His performance in the first set against Alexander Zverev was impressive, and if he can maintain that level of serving, he will considerably boost his chances of winning.

Both players are well-versed in each other's game at this point and are confident that their top level is capable of winning the match. It will come down to who can execute their game plan better. First serve percentage would be a key factor, and neither player can afford to be lower than 55. Sinner is on a 26-match winning streak on this surface, giving him a slight advantage. Alcaraz tends to lose focus at times, which improves Sinner's chances. After five straight losses against Alcaraz, the Wimbledon win was huge for Sinner mentally, and I think he takes this one.

Prediction: Sinner in 3

Carlos Alcaraz defeated Alexander Zverev in the semifinals of the ATP Cincinnati 2025 to set up a final showdown with Jannik Sinner, another chapter in an increasingly epic rivalry. There is little to blame Zverev for, as he suffered a physical dip right when he was displaying his best tennis. With a 6-4 and 6-3 victory in 1 hour and 45 minutes, the world number two advances to the grand final of the American tournament.

After an intense afternoon filled with rumors of possible physical issues for the German player and a half-hour delay due to a wet court from rain-bearing clouds, both Sascha and Carlos took to the court eager to secure the second ticket to the final alongside Jannik Sinner.

Tension was palpable from the start as both players tried to break the deadlock. With a spectacular volley, Carlos took the lead on the scoreboard, aware that there was still much to be done.



Focused on every exchange and unafraid of engaging in long rallies, the Spanish player claimed the first set, showcasing a high level also on serve, daring to approach the net repeatedly and confidently executing drop shots that disrupted Zverev's rhythm.

Under the guidance of his team, urging him to take control of the match, Alcaraz had the chance to break early in the second set, but the Murcian displayed frustration on court as Zverev regained ground, not as affected at the time by his inverted forehand.

Zverev Struggles in Peak Temperatures

Just when it seemed like the German was gaining control of the match, he called for the medical staff as he was feeling unwell, possibly dizzy due to the high temperatures in Cincinnati. While he managed to hold his serve, Zverev struggled, lacking energy and finding it challenging in exchanges.

Completely covered in ice, Alexander tried to improve his feelings as minutes passed, while Alcaraz seemed unfazed by the conditions. Anxious for the ordeal to end, Zverev extended his hand to Alcaraz, who had to stay focused to complete the task. Next up: Jannik Sinner.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The ATP Winston-Salem is the famous last pit stop before the US Open, giving ATP players one more chance to accumulate minutes and confidence. There will be no shortage of entertaining matches on Day 1 of the tournament, and we here at LWOT have every match covered in our daily predictions, including Mackenzie McDonald vs Brandon Holt. Who will advance?

Head-to-head: first meeting

While Goffin may be past his peak, he's still capable of producing the odd deep run in a Tour-level tournament almost every season. The Belgian's durability appears to be his biggest hurdle these days, and Martinez will look to wear him down. The Spaniard produced some solid tennis in beating Nicolas Jarry in Cincinnati, but his lack of wins on hard courts means Goffin might have enough to take this.
Prediction: Goffin in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

It took Arthur Rinderknech three tries before he scored his first win in Winston-Salem last season. While Hamad Medjedovic has never played in this tournament before, he'll look to carry his momentum from Cincinnati, where he produced a spirited performance in a tight straight-sets defeat to Carlos Alcaraz. Rinderknech has steady hands, but it doesn't always feel like he dictates matches. Medjedovic can take the initiative, and he has the higher upside between them.
Prediction: Medjedovic in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

Bu won 40 matches on hard courts last year in a breakout season. He has a meagre six match wins on the same surface this year, although he has significantly cut down his participation in Challenger-level tournaments. Tseng's struggles are also evident with five wins from 12 matches on hard courts. Bu is the reliable player who can physically overmatch and overpower Tseng on a quick court.
Prediction: Bu in 2

 

Head-to-head: Carreno Busta 1-0 Nishioka

This is a tricky one to pick a winner given where both players are at right now, but Carreno Busta has a tremendous track record in Winston-Salem. He's a former champion and even during an injury-hit 2024 season, he stormed to the semifinals before retiring against Alex Michelsen. Nishioka has an equally messy injury record and has six documented retirements this season. Their tennis demands a lot out of them physically. The first set is crucial as it could dictate the outcome, and Carreno Busta's record in this tournament gives him a significant edge.
Prediction: Carreno Busta in 2

Carlos Alcaraz has enjoyed a perfect return to tennis after his post-Wimbledon break, and will now face off against Jannik Sinner yet again, this time in the Cincinnati Open final.

It marks a rematch of their Wimbledon and Italian Open showdowns, both of which were for the title.

Nowadays, given their respective seedings, it feels like anytime they meet, it will be to contest the sport's greatest honours.

Whoever comes out on top will have given themselves the perfect preparation for the upcoming US Open, in what is the final chance to claim a major before the season starts to wind down.

And yet, even before Carlos Alcaraz had beaten Alexander Zverev in a semi-final marred by the latter's struggling fitness, he was told what both his best and weakest qualities were.

The person who offered this insight was Rick Macci, famed for being the formative coach of both Serena and Venus Williams before they went on to accomplish greatness.

His voice within the tennis community is a relentless one, and few can deny his credentials given the legendary figures he will forever be associated with.

Carlos best quality is he has every shot in the book and every match he will give it a look. His weakest quality is he has every shot in the book and sometimes lets you off the hook. @carlosalcaraz

Ironically, he named the same trait for both Alcaraz's best and worst qualities, suggesting that the never-ending bag of tricks makes him both dangerous, but also confused at times.

After all, it can be hard to decide when and where to use certain shots, knowing that they are all at his disposal.

Despite this critical claim from Macci, wrapped up in what feels oddly like a compliment, Alcaraz has quietly cruised into yet another Cincinnati Open final.

This time, he will have Jannik Sinner to deal with, having lost to Novak Djokovic last time out in what many still regard as one of the greatest best-of-three matches ever played.

In a match that lasted just shy of four hours, it was the Serbian who claimed his revenge after Alcaraz had dethroned him in the Wimbledon final just a month earlier.

Since that clash two years ago, the Spaniard's budding dominance has been met by Sinner, with the two establishing a duopoly at the apex of the men's game that seemingly no one can trouble.

The fact that they are set to meet again in yet another final, in the third straight event that both have entered, does little to dispel this notion.

Alas, it offers fans yet another iteration of this mouth-watering clash, which seems poised to be one of the best in the sport's history should they continue meeting in the final of some of the most elite competitions.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Emma Raducanu 'scared' ahead of U.S. Open challenge with Carlos Alcaraz","https://www.the-express.com/sport/tennis/180626/emma-raducanu-carlos-alcaraz-us-open","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 08:51:31 GMT","



Emma Raducanu touches down in New York today to compete in a blockbuster new mixed doubles showcase at the U.S. Open that has drawn A-list talent - and fierce criticism.

The 2021 New York queen will join forces with Wimbledon runner-up Carlos Alcaraz in a star-studded partnership while Novak Djokovic teams up with Olga Danilovic.

Meanwhile, Venus Williams, now 45, will hunt the $1m top prize alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka as the boundary between sport and spectacle becomes increasingly blurred.

Wimbledon champions Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have signed up for the two-day extravaganza with just one traditional doubles duo - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - receiving a wildcard so far.

Two additional spots remain up for grabs. The event forms part of Fan Week next Tuesday and Wednesday - with U.S. Open singles action kicking off next Sunday (August 24) - as the season's final Grand Slam transforms into a three-week spectacle.



Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has slammed the new format as something that ""makes a mockery of the event"" and branded it ""an exhibition, not a proper event.""

However, previous celebrity mixed doubles alliances, including Andy Murray's partnership with Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, have captivated audiences and television viewers alike.

The Big Apple's battle of the sexes is now poised to become a yearly tradition. For Raducanu, it marks a comeback to the spotlight at Flushing Meadows following her inability to secure a singles victory in New York since 2021.

World No. 2 Alcaraz disclosed he made a ""special request"" to partner the British No. 1 and playfully suggested she would be ""the boss"". Raducanu displayed her playful side when discussing the prospect of facing Ben Shelton's blistering 150mph serve.

DON'T MISS

""I think I'm most scared to play certain shots,"" she laughed. ""Ben Shelton's serve, that scares me. That's probably one in particular. And then obviously all the guys. It's very difficult to return their serves. Reilly Opelka? He's serving from a stepladder.

""It's incredible. But of course I'm very excited. It's such a unique opportunity, and I think a lot of the females will probably be feeling the same way. Returning the guys' serve is quite difficult.""

However, not all the major stars will compete next week. World No. 2 Coco Gauff opted against participating in her home Grand Slam because the preparation week is ""already packed"". She explained: ""I'm very competitive, if I were to lose, I would not be happy. So, I didn't want to waste mental energy on that.""

Meanwhile, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka declared she was remaining ""loyal"" to Grigor Dimitrov and will not pursue another partner after the Bulgarian withdrew with a pectoral injury sustained at Wimbledon. Jack Draper has selected Jessica Pegula as his new partner following the withdrawals of both Qinwen Zheng and Paula Badosa.

Highgate's Holly Brewester became a finalist on the manicured lawns of Wimbledon after an unforgettable experience at SW19.

Brewester, 13, who attends Highgate School and lives in Highgate, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Brewester, who described Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka as her tennis icon, finished runner-up in the girls' U14 singles final – and revealed it was an experience she will never forget.

She said: ""It's a really good feeling to make the final because I've been here the whole week fighting to make it.

""I played really well in all of my matches and even though I didn't get the result that I wanted.

“I know a few people here that I've played with before and the environment is nice, it's quite calm. The people here treat you really well.

""It's really inspired me to carry on my tennis because it's so amazing to be at Wimbledon and hopefully I get here as a professional one day.

“Hopefully I will go pro, it would be great to do that. It's amazing being here so it does feel like that is a little bit more possible.""

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025, with Brewester representing Coolhurst Tennis Club.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories also included wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals also saw the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid were in attendance to cheer on the youngsters at SW19 and offer his experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

“This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

Both have played for trophies this season in Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon

Cincinatti: World No 1 Jannik Sinner and hot rival Carlos Alcaraz will face off in a major final for the fourth time this season after both booked straight-set wins into the title match at the ATP-WTA Cincinnati Open on Saturday.

Defending champion Sinner ruthlessly subdued 136th-ranked qualifier Terence Atmane 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 while Spanish second seed Alcaraz defeated an ailing Alexander Zverev, who was suffering badly from the 32 Celsius heat and humidity, by 6-4, 6-3.

Alcaraz and Sinner have played for trophies this season in Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon, with the Italian winning their most recent at the All England Club last month.

Sinner, celebrating his 24th birthday, ended Frenchman Atmane's dream run and will now try to become the first man since Roger Federer in 2014-15 to win back-to-back titles in Cincinnati.

Sinner, tuning up for the US Open in his first tournament since winning Wimbledon, hasn't dropped a set en route to the final.

""It's a very, very tough challenge every time you play a new opponent,"" Sinner said. ""In the later stages of the tournament,the pressure is on, they deserve to be there.""

Alcaraz will also be playing in his second Cincy final after losing to Novak Djokovic in 2023.

The Spaniard increased his ATP season match win lead to 53 in a year of five titles.

Alcaraz broke Zverev once in the opening set to claim it before the German, who is diabetic, began feeling poorly and took a medical timeout off court after the third game of the second set.

Zverev, who has retired in only two matches since 2014, came back out to finish what was a patchy match from Alcaraz, who double-faulted for times in the second game of the second set but won the last 12 points with Zverev running on fumes.

""We started well with good rallies, a good level,"" Alcaraz said. ""All of a sudden he felt bad and I was thinking more about how he was feeling instead of playing good tennis.

""It was tough and I just wish him all the best.""

Alcaraz said he is keen to try and take his Wimbledon revenge on Sinner in the unorthodox Monday final.

""We always bring our best tennis. We raise each other's level. I'm ready to take the challenge,"" Alcaraz said.

""I will try and adjust my game better and correct what I did wrong in our last match. I want to be ready with my 100%. Mentally I'll be ready -- I'm excited for Monday.""

Atmane gave birthday boy Sinner a Pokemon card shortly before they went on court, but he was in a less giving mood once they were underway.

But Sinner surrendered just three points in his first six service games as they went to the tiebreaker with neither man facing a break point.

Atmane double faulted on the first point of the decider and Sinner was away, powering to a 5-2 lead and pocketing the set at his second opportunity.

""My experience helped in the first set,"" he said. ""I'm very happy to go through to another final.

""I tried to focus on myself, how I usually play, and then try to adapt a little bit to his game style,"" Sinner said. ""And that's exactly what I did today.

""The pressure was on me. That's normal in the position where I am in -- he was ready to fight.""

""My goal has always been the US Open, But we have put in the work here, in the gym and in practice. I just hope to be ready for New York.""

Sinner showed a first sign of vulnerability as he needed five game points to hold serve in the opening game of the second set.

But that was the closest look Atmane got at his serve, and Sinner broke the Frenchman for a 3-1 lead and again to seal the match.

Atmane, who is projected to crack the top 70 in the world rankings, became Sinner's 22nd straight French victim since May 2021, when he lost to Arthur Rinderknech in Lyon.

Coco Gauff's summer has not gone to plan since capturing her second Grand Slam title.

After clinching the French Open title in June, Gauff has struggled for form on the WTA Tour, losing to players ranked much lower than herself.

Gauff was stunned in straight sets by Dayana Yastremska in the Wimbledon first round before being knocked out of the Canadian Open by 18-year-old Victoria Mboko.

At the Cincinnati Open, Gauff was defeated by 2024 Wimbledon finalist Jasmine Paolini in the quarter-finals.

One notable figure, who has coached Maria Sharapova, has weighed in on Gauff's recent struggles.

Legendary tennis coach Rick Macci has a wealth of knowledge to share after years of coaching some of tennis' most high-profile figures.

The 70-year-old coached Serena and Venus Williams while they were growing up in Compton, California. Since then, Macci has also worked with Maria Sharapova, Jennifer Capriati and Andy Roddick.

Macci, a regular contributor to tennis discourse, has discussed Gauff's ‘career crossroads' ahead of the US Open, suggesting she needs a ‘science-based plan' to fix her second serve and forehand.

On X [Twitter] Macci said: “Coco will be OK as she fights and knows how to play. But to ever breathe rare air she has to address the alarming red flare. 

“She is at a career crossroad[s] with the second serve and forehand but needs a science-based plan. 

Coco will be OK as she fights and knows how to Play. But to ever breathe rare air she has to address the alarming red flare. She is at a career crossroad with the 2nd serve and forehand but needs a science based Plan. This will not magically go away and bubbles up more under…

“This will not magically go away and bubbles up more under extreme pressure that particular day.”

When comparing Coco Gauff's serve to her rivals, it is evident she has a major issue.

Over her last five matches, Gauff has averaged a whopping 9.2 double faults per match. Elena Rybakina is second on the list, averaging 4.2 double faults over the same period.

Gauff also has the lowest winning percentage on second-serve points over her last five matches. She has won 48.5 per cent of her second-serve points.

Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Jessica Pegula and Elena Rybakina have all averaged over 50 per cent in this category across their last five matches.

The American must correct this issue ahead of the US Open, or she may continue to struggle.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Chanda Rubin is concerned about Coco Gauff heading to the US Open after what happened with her team in Cincinnati","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/chanda-rubin-is-concerned-about-coco-gauff-heading-to-the-us-open-after-what-happened-with-her-team-in-cincinnati/","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Coco Gauff is not heading into the US Open in the form that she would have liked to have been in.

Gauff was beaten by Jasmine Paolini in the Cincinnati Open quarterfinals, in her second consecutive defeat to the Italian.

It was not a tidy match from either player, but particularly Gauff, who hit 62 unforced errors and 16 double faults.

As a result of her latest defeat, Gauff could now be overtaken by Iga Swiatek in the WTA rankings.

The serve has been a big issue for Gauff throughout the North American hard court swing so far, but she has still managed to find a way to come through a lot of matches in spite of it.

However, when discussing concerns ahead of the US Open, former top 10 singles player and Grand Slam doubles champion Chanda Rubin explained how she noticed Gauff's demeanour being more negative towards her team against Paolini.

“But Coco Gauff, she won Roland Garros, she made a tough transition onto the grass, she figured kind of, tough turnaround, she had a lot of things going on, she didn't quite get it going there,” Rubin said on Tennis Channel. 

“Now to start the hard court swing, she's won a few matches, she's won some matches here, didn't have to play a couple of matches. But I just thought she might be in a bit of a better place. 

“We saw it with the double faults, she handles it so beautifully, but we saw her start to get a little bit frayed, get a little irritated, kind of direct it to her team there, so that for me would be the only concern.

“How is she feeling? Does she feel confident she can work through some tough matches in New York? Does she have enough matches behind her on the hard courts? 

“So, that would be my concern, but certainly she has that ability, she has the athleticism to turn it on and in New York she gets such incredible energy, I think that's going to go a long way for her. But certainly, the game was a little frustrating for her, certainly yesterday against Paolini.”

While there are big concerns for Gauff heading into her home major this year, there are also some about world number one and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka as well.

This is something that former top 10 player CoCo Vandeweghe has spoken about, pointing out Sabalenka's major final defeats at Roland Garros and the Australian Open already this year.

Vandeweghe commentated on her most recent defeat against Elena Rybakina, where she claimed Sabalenka was simply unable to dictate play like she is usually able to.

“I think I got to say Sabalenka, honestly,” said Vandeweghe. “Because she has been so close but has fallen short so many times. She's been world number one, she is the one that is supposed to have so many titles. I just feel like losing a couple of Grand Slam finals, losing early now, considering this is an early loss for a world number one. 

“I think we got to call question marks as to where she is at, because that beating that Rybakina gave her, Chanda and I called that match and it was, she didn't even have a say so in what was happening out there and for a big hitter that is definitely a gut check of, ‘I just got out-played in my own game style, now what do I do?'. 

“I think for Coco, it's still the same as what we have seen in previous years, but her competitiveness and her tenacity has gotten her through, and especially…she shines in these Grand Slams. So, I'm not as worried for Coco as I am for Aryna.”

Former world number one Lindsay Davenport then weighed into the discussion, claiming Sabalenka has more pressure as Gauff has already won Roland Garros this year.

When voicing her concerns about the Belarusian, Davenport called Sabalenka's backhand ‘a little bit of a mess'.

“We are talking about two players whose sole goal is to win majors, and to win the US Open, so looking at both of them I think it's equal, I agree with you guys,” said Davenport. 

“If you look at Sabalenka, as CoCo said she has had so many heartbreakers this year, she is going into the last major and she has not won one yet this year, so even more pressure on her. Little bit less on Gauff, because hey she won Roland Garros, so at least when the season's over she has at least one major. 

“But, when you get to the point where you are holding more than one Grand Slam it becomes about winning more majors. 

“Sabalenka, she got outhit. Her backhand is a little bit of a mess right now, she is going to have to figure some technique there, use her legs more, way too many errors from that side. And Gauff looked exasperated last night that this was still happening on her serve. You just hope that this doesn't come up at the US Open when the pressure is even more.”

Both Gauff and Sabalenka will be hoping to correct these frailties in their games by the time the US Open comes around.

They will both go straight into singles, which begins on Sunday, August 24, after Sabalenka revealed she would no longer be playing US Open mixed doubles.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic's season will resume directly at the US Open, which will start in New York in exactly one week and promise to give a great show. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz – who will be the protagonists of the Cincinnati Masters 1000 final tomorrow – will start as the top favorites also in the last Grand Slam of the season, but the Serbian legend can never be underestimated and will try to make tennis history for the umpteenth time by becoming the oldest ever to triumph in a Major.

The 38-year-old from Belgrade chose not to play official tournaments after his defeat to Sinner in the semi-final of the Wimbledon Championships, preferring to recharge his batteries together with his family and friends first in Croatia and then in Greece.

The former world number 1 missed the Masters 1000 in Toronto and Cincinnati, a choice that has caused some concern among fans and insiders. Nole has not played an official match on the hard courts since the Miami Open final against Jakub Mensik and would certainly have needed to find a rhythm in view of a tournament that promises to be very demanding from an athletic point of view (also due to the temperatures).

Although he has won four times at Flushing Meadows, Novak has always had an up-and-down relationship with this tournament and will also need a bit of luck when the draw is drawn.

During a recent interview with 'Tennis365', legendary coach Rick Macci discussed Djokovic's chances in NY: ""In my opinion, he is the greatest tennis player of all time and can never be underestimated when a tournament of this importance starts. He can definitely win the US Open, but you need the right conditions.

If he has a very tough path and is forced to use a lot of energies during the first week, then it would become almost impossible to beat Alcaraz and Sinner in the final rounds. He will have to hope for a favorable draw and we will have to see how his body reacts to the various efforts.""

Térence Atmane is making headlines in the tennis world after his stunning run at the Cincinnati Open. The 23-year-old French qualifier shocked everyone by reaching the semifinals of the Masters 1000 event, a performance that caught the eye of tennis legend Martina Navratilova and sparked calls for him to receive an emergency US Open wildcard.

Tennis expert Jon Wertheim was so impressed with Atmane's Cincinnati performance that he made a strong case for an emergency US Open wildcard. Wertheim wrote:

“A serious attaboy for Atmane…. Taking out Cobolli, Fonseca, Fritz, and Rune (and finally going down to No.1 Sinner 7-6, 6-2) is worthy of an emergency @usopen main draw wild card….”

This is where veteran Navratilova stepped in with her support. The nine-time Wimbledon champion responded to Wertheim's post with a simple but powerful two-word reaction:

“Agreed 100…”

Agreed 100…. https://t.co/2wZWDMO0Jx

— Martina Navratilova (@Martina) August 16, 2025



Navratilova's endorsement carries significant weight. She won four US Open singles titles and reached the final eight times. The tennis icon is one of the most successful players in tennis history, with 59 Grand Slam titles under her name.

Currently, Atmane is listed as an alternate for the US Open main draw. His ranking at the start of Cincinnati was 136, which was not high enough for direct entry. However, his semifinal run has boosted him to around number 69 in the live rankings.

Atmane's path to the semifinals was nothing short of spectacular. Before this week, he had only one tour-level win all season. He came through qualifying without dropping a set, setting the stage for what would become one of the most remarkable breakthrough performances in recent memory.

In the main draw, he defeated Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka in the first round. Next came his upset of 15th seed Flavio Cobolli in a tough three-set battle. He then beat rising star Joao Fonseca in straight sets, building momentum with each victory.

The real shocks came in the fourth round and quarterfinals. First, he stunned fourth seed Taylor Fritz, the top American player, in three sets. The victory over Fritz was his first Top 10 win and came on American soil, making it even more impressive. He then backed it up with a straight-sets victory over seventh seed Holger Rune. The 6-2, 6-3 win over the Danish player secured his place in the semifinals.

Following his quarterfinal win over Rune, Atmane wrote ‘Fermi's Paradox' on the camera lens, which had the whole world in confusion.



His incredible run finally ended against world number one Jannik Sinner in the semifinals. Despite losing 7-6 (4), 6-2, Atmane showed his skill by not facing a break point in the opening set and pushing Sinner to a tiebreak.

Atmane became the first qualifier to reach the Cincinnati semifinals since 2015. He also became the first Frenchman to reach this stage since Richard Gasquet in 2019, cementing his place in tournament history with this breakthrough performance.

The tennis world could hardly believe Terence Atmane's run this week at the Cincinnati Open, where the No. 136 in the PIF ATP Rankings came through qualifying and earned Top 10 wins against Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune to reach his first tour-level semi-final.

After a 7-6(4), 6-2 defeat to World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in Saturday's semis, Atmane was still coming to grips with his own success.

""Absolutely crazy, insane. I still cannot believe that I made the semi-finals here,"" he said post-match. ""Playing against Sinner today was also a very good memory for myself, and I will remember that for a long time.""

Reflecting on the match, in which he did not face a break point in the opening set, Atmane was already processing the lessons he learned from the stadium showdown.

""I think that he was just better than me in the second set. Simple as that,"" he said. ""He took all the responsibilities in the second set. Me, I think that I let him a little bit play his game, just like 1 per cent, and when you play the world No. 1, it's over already [if you do that].""

Atmane admitted his body felt the strain in his eighth match of the week, including two in qualifying. But he credited his mentality, rather than anything physical, for his surprising success this week.

""I worked a lot mentally to be able to stabilise myself, trying to put my mind stronger than my emotions,"" he offered, discussing what has changed from his middling results on the ATP Challenger Tour earlier this year. ""I think that's the key for me to success at a high level. And I think that I will have to repeat this kind of week to make it to the high level.""



As a new name to many tennis fans, Atmane was asked at the close of his media availability to describe himself beyond the tennis court. He discussed his love of Japanese culture and food, including his Pokemon card collection, and video games like Fortnite, Minecraft and Call of Duty. He also shared that he has ""three wonderful cats"" and enjoys finding nice coffee places when he travels to tournaments.

After beating Rune in the quarter-finals, his message on the camera lens shed light into another off-court interest. He wrote ""Fermi's paradox?!"" — alluding to the possibility of alien life.

""I'm fascinated about the world that we are living in, space, the universe,"" he added. One thing is for sure: his tennis this week was out of this world.

 For the fourth time in the space of three months, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will face off with a big title on the line when they clash in the championship match at the Cincinnati Open. 

 The duo's red-hot Lexus ATP Head2Head series has already lit up Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 2025, and Monday's meeting at 3 p.m. EDT (9 p.m. CEST) in Ohio will once again have fans on tenterhooks waiting to see who can notch the latest success in one of sport's great ongoing rivalries. 

JANNIK SINNER. CARLOS ALCARAZ.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are in for a treat 🎭@CincyTennis | #CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/tbSSztiWps

 The No. 1 and No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, respectively, both Sinner and Alcaraz have been ‘scintillating in Cincy' so far this year. Defending champion Sinner has not dropped a set in reaching his eighth ATP Masters 1000 final and enters the match on a 26-match winning streak on hard courts. 

 “It's going to be a very, very difficult match, but hopefully it's going to be, in any case, a good match,” said Sinner after he downed Terence Atmane in the semi-finals. “Hopefully it's a very high-level match. That's what for us players is important, but also for the people who are watching… We will see what kind of fun is going to [happen] on Monday.” 

 Alcaraz may have dropped two sets en route to the title match, but the Spaniard has faced a tougher path than Sinner judging by his opponents' PIF ATP Rankings. He held off ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals before downing third seed Alexander Zverev in the last four, and the seven-time Masters 1000 champion will be full of confidence as he chases his Tour-leading sixth title of 2025. 

 “I'm excited about it. It's going to be great,” said Alcaraz ahead of facing Sinner in what will be his seventh consecutive tour-level final. “He won the last one, I won the first two finals, so I think it's going to be really interesting. It's the first final [between us this year] on a hard court, so I'm excited about taking that challenge. 

 “I know that Jannik, without a doubt, is the best player in the world on hard courts and probably on every surface right now, so it's going to be a great match and I have to be ready for that.” 

 After he let slip three championship points at Roland Garros in July to fall to a fifth consecutive defeat against Alcaraz, Sinner halted the Spaniard's momentum in their rivalry in style at Wimbledon in early July. The Italian clinched a four-set victory to seal his maiden title at SW19 and reduce his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against Alcaraz to 5-8. 

 For many, Sinner and Alcaraz's rivalry is defined by the contrast between the former's consistent all-around elite displays, featuring precise serving and cleanly struck groundstrokes, and the latter's sublime shotmaking genius and ability to string together unstoppable hot streaks when the stakes are at their greatest. Fans will be eager to see what sort of drama that intriguing combination produces on Monday in Cincinnati. 

 “The ability of not having any weakness,” said Alcaraz on Saturday, when asked what makes Sinner such a tough opponent. “It is crazy, the way he always plays at his best. It seems like you have to earn every point every game. He makes you suffer since the first point of the match until the last ball. The capacity of being there mentally, point after point, not having up and downs on the match makes him really, really special.”

 Both Sinner and Alcaraz have already qualified for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals, but the latter stands 1,540 points clear of his rival in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Sinner has the opportunity to cut Alcaraz's lead with victory in Cincinnati as both players chase ATP Year-End No. 1 present by PIF honours. Should Sinner triumph and improve his record for the season to 27-3, he would trail Alcaraz by just 1,190 points heading into the US Open. 

 On the other hand Alcaraz, who is 53-6 for 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, could extend his Live Race lead to 1,890 points by defeating Sinner to clinch his first Cincinnati crown. Victory in Ohio would also banish painful memories for Alcaraz at the Lindner Family Tennis Center, where he held a championship point in the 2023 final before losing to Novak Djokovic in a modern Masters 1000 classic.

Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his seventh consecutive tour-level final by beating an ailing Alexander Zverev on Saturday at the Cincinnati Open. The 6-4, 6-3 victory set up a final showdown with Jannik Sinner, a rematch of the Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon title matches this season.

A high-quality opening set was decided by a late burst of Alcaraz brilliance, before the sweat-drenched Zverev began to struggle physically in the second. The German, who was treated by the physio in his dominant quarter-final win against Ben Shelton on Friday, left the court for a medical timeout at 2-1 in the second and was clearly compromised the rest of the match.

""It's never easy playing against someone that you know is not feeling 100 per cent. It's even tougher when it comes from Sascha, such a great player, such a great person off the court. We have a really good relationship,"" Alcaraz said after levelling the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 6-6.

""We started the match really good, playing good rallies, a good level of tennis,"" added the Spaniard, who escaped 0/40 at 1-2 in the opening set. ""But then all of a sudden he started to feel bad. And then my focus, I was thinking about how he's feeling, besides focusing on myself and playing good tennis. It was a really difficult situation for me and I just wish him all the best.""

The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings attacked the Zverev forehand from the start, hitting high and heavy cross-court balls off his own forehand wing to target that corner. Conversely, Zverev found success by taking his forehand down the line at every opportunity to avoid Alcaraz's preferred pattern.

From 2-3 in the opening set, Alcaraz found a new gear with inspired shotmaking to take the first set and break to open the second. The Spaniard gifted the break back by hitting three consecutive double faults in the next game, but a hampered Zverev was not able to challenge beyond that.

The straightforward manner of the semi-final victory was in stark contrast to Alcaraz's quarter-final against Rublev, which he won 7-5 in the third set. He also lost the second set to Damir Dzumhur in his opening round.



Through to his ninth ATP Masters 1000 final (7-1) and first on hard courts since he claimed the Indian Wells crown last year, Alcaraz extended his winning streak to 16 matches at that prestigious level on the heels of his title runs in Monte-Carlo and Rome. He is 38-2 overall since the start of April, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

At 22 years and three months, Alcaraz is the third-youngest player to reach nine Masters 1000 finals after Rafael Nadal (20) and Novak Djokovic (21).

After playing his 12th Lexus ATP Head2Head match against Zverev — their first meeting this year after four in 2024 — Alcaraz will next meet Sinner for the fourth time this year and 14th time overall.

""I'm really looking forward to playing against him once again,"" said the Spaniard, who fell in four sets to his rival in their most recent meeting at Wimbledon. ""We raise our level to the top and we bring a really beautiful tennis to the match. I'm ready to take the challenge. I'm ready to see the things that I did wrong in the last match and trying to be better on that side on Monday.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Andrea Gaudenzi Q&A: profit sharing, calendar, Masters 1000 format & more","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/andrea-gaudenzi-question-and-answer-august-2025","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:09:23 GMT","

This month, the National Bank Open and Cincinnati Open debuted their new 12-day formats — a first under the expanded ATP Masters 1000 structure. A landmark $18.3m profit-sharing announcement for 2024 has further boosted record compensation. It's all part of a broader ATP Tour shift: bigger events, greater long-term value, and more returns for players and tournaments. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi discusses the strategy, trade-offs, and what's next.

Q: The announcement of $18.3 million in profit sharing is a significant moment. How do you reflect on the progress of OneVision so far?
Having profit sharing at all is a sign of a healthy, growing ecosystem. And not just for players - it's also a strong indicator that tournaments are performing well. In just our second year of the strategic plan, $18.3 million is a big number. To put that in perspective, it's equivalent to a 25% increase on base prize money across the Masters 1000 category. That increase simply wouldn't exist under the previous system, and players now have full transparency on the tournament financials of our top tier events.

What excites me most, though, is the room for future growth. We're only scratching the surface. With the right foundations in place – expanded formats, stronger event infrastructure - we're unlocking new levels of investment, as Cincinnati has shown this year.

I have no doubt that profit sharing, together with the tournament expansions, will come to be seen as a transformational shift. Big reforms take time, and we need patience. But I'm confident the long-term growth they'll deliver will benefit everyone in the sport.

 

Q: Cincinnati's first edition as a 12-day event is launching in parallel with its new facilities. How important is that type of infrastructure investment?
It's crucial. The shift to a 12-day format gave tournaments the time, stability and confidence they needed to think bigger — and what's happening in Cincinnati is a perfect example.

They've undertaken a $260 million, multi-phase redevelopment that will lift every part of the event. For fans, it means more ticket availability and expanded stadium capacity, plus an upgraded on-site experience that matches the scale of a top-tier global event. For players, it's new locker rooms, improved recovery areas and better conditions across the board. For media, it's world-class broadcast infrastructure that helps elevate how the event is seen around the world.

And these aren't just cosmetic upgrades. The revenue generated by these improvements flows directly back to players through our profit-sharing model. This is exactly the kind of long-term, structural investment the sport needs — and it's only been possible because of the expanded format.

Q: What about the impact on the rest of the calendar, and player schedules?
The expanded format does increase time on-site, and that's a real consideration. But it also unlocks the revenue potential needed to elevate the entire Tour. Reforms like these were debated at length - with the Player Advisory Council, with the Board - over several years.

One of our clear strategic goals is to provide more money to more players. We've done it with the player pension expanding from 165 to 300 players, by more than doubling prize money at the Challenger level since 2022. And we're doing it though big events, with big stages and bigger draw sizes, that drive the commercial engine of the sport.

Just look at what's happening: record bonus pools, nine-figure infrastructure projects in Rome, Madrid, Shanghai, Cincinnati. None of this happens without the breathing room provided by the 12-day window. It's allowed promoters to reinvest and enabled a 50 50 share of profits. That's money flowing straight back to the locker room.

Some of the current tension undoubtedly lies in the different time horizons. We must think long term. Give this model five or ten years and I believe the Masters 1000s will have grown exponentially across all metrics and we'll look back at this move as the foundation of that shift.

Q: There's been a lot of debate about the length of the season, calendar complexity, and player fatigue. What's your view?
Across many sports, there's a clear trend toward more competition—just look at soccer, with the expanded Club World Cup that launched this summer. Our calendar is complex. It's a long season and going deep week after week is demanding. But this is also an individual sport: one player might be out in the first round, another is lifting the trophy after the final. Finding a solution that works for both ends of that spectrum is never straightforward, and you cannot build a calendar around just a single cohort of players. All cohorts must be considered.

Our goal at ATP is to extend the off-season. Proper rest benefits everyone—players, fans, and the quality of competition. But we can't act alone. Tournaments own their own licences, and any structural change requires alignment. We're in active discussions now, and I'm optimistic about the direction we're heading.

One point that often gets overlooked: players choose their own schedules. That freedom is rare in professional sport. But with that comes responsibility—knowing when to push and when to recover.

And finally we should be clear: ATP doesn't control the entire calendar. We work around Grand Slams, Davis Cup, and other fixed dates. That's exactly why OneVision proposes a unified governance model—bringing all stakeholders to the same table so we can make coherent, sport-wide decisions around things like the calendar.

Q: Do players have the right level of playing commitments?
We're always trying to find the right balance. As it stands, 19 events count toward your ranking — that becomes 18 next year. The mandatory list remains eight Masters. I don't believe that is excessive. Those marquee events are what give the season structure and create the revenues that now flow back to players—through record prize money, rising bonus pools and profit sharing.

Those events also anchor the storytelling of our whole season for the fans. Our job is to make sure the biggest stages are strong and reliable. When the top players turn up, fans respond, sponsors respond, and the whole sport moves forward. The numbers can always be tweaked, but the principle of a clear, premium spine to the season is non negotiable.

Players also need time to adapt to the changes we've implemented. The expansion of certain ATP Masters 1000 events equates to approximately 15 extra on-site days over the season. These added days must be factored in when building schedules, and it's only logical that players will need to scale back their commitments in other areas. Doing so requires discipline, as well as the willingness to forgo appearance fees when necessary. And of course, if a player exits early from a top-tier event, they retain the flexibility to select additional tournaments at lower levels to get more matches. Essentially, it's a top-down waterfall approach.

Q: What about when top players miss events, like Sinner and Alcaraz in Toronto?
Withdrawals are part of professional sport, especially in one as physically demanding as tennis. In this case, both Jannik and Carlos had deep runs to the finals of both Roland Garros and Wimbledon—an incredible achievement. With only a two-week turnaround between Wimbledon and Toronto this year, the schedule was particularly tight. Of course, I feel for the tournament. It was unfortunate but it's not the first time, and it won't be the last time a Masters 1000 event faces withdrawals. That's the reality of our sport.

In general though, when you step back and look at the data across recent years, player participation at the Masters 1000 level remains very strong. We need to assess the impact of reforms over time, using the full picture—attendance, viewership, player participation, compensation, and commercial performance. That's how we make informed, long-term decisions that serve the sport as a whole.

Q: How do appearance fees factor into all this when it comes to player scheduling?
Appearance fees are part of the landscape. They're not often talked about, but they move a lot of money, at the 500 and 250 level, where promoters regularly spend millions to secure big names. For top players, it's guaranteed income. I understand the appeal.

But players and their teams also have to be mindful of unintended consequences. Those financial incentives don't always align with what's best for a player's ranking, recovery, or long term career.

Q: Do exhibition events pose a problem for the ATP Tour?
Not necessarily. Exhibitions offer players another way to earn, and that's part of the freedom that comes with being an independent contractor. I don't take issue with the concept.

But we have to be honest: exhibitions benefit a very small number of players. They don't offer ranking points, they don't reinvest into the ecosystem, and they don't support the wider player base who rely on Tour events for their livelihoods.

That's why our focus has to remain on ATP events. They're the foundation of the sport—built to sustain hundreds of players, not just a few. When players choose to prioritise the Tour, they're strengthening the entire pyramid.

Q: What are the advantages for players to be independent contractors compared to some other team sports where they are employees?
There are trade-offs either way. Employees get more stability, but far less flexibility. Of course, employees lose their stability during strikes and employer lockouts. Independent contractors have freedom — to play where they want, build their teams, commercialise their brands, and attract income opportunities away from the Tour through exhibition events etc.

As an independent contractor you're not bound to the Tour the way an NBA or NFL player is tied to a collective-bargaining agreement, or as an employee in a team. If you don't want to play a tournament, you don't have to — zero-pointer rules and bonus-pools incentivize participation, but they don't force it.

At the same time, the Tour has built-in protections for players you'd normally only see under an employment model, like the player pension programme, or the Baseline financial guarantee for the Top 250. In other words, players retain control (schedule, endorsements, exhibitions) while enjoying many of the safety nets employees get. Plus, a say in every decision made by the Tour through player representatives that comprise 50% of the Board. That combination is rare in pro sport. In terms of the future, we remain open minded but you have to weigh the pros and cons of the various options, and importantly we need the Grand Slams to also be part of that conversation too, which is what we're advocating for under OneVision.

MASON, OH—“It's never easy playing against someone you know is not 100 percent,” Carlos Alcaraz said after his 6-4, 6-3 win over Alexander Zverev in the semifinals here on Saturday night.After seeing what happened to the Spaniard early in the second set, those words may sound like something of an understatement.With Alcaraz up a set and serving at 1-0 in the second, Zverev stopped moving for anything that was more than a step away from him. He let one ground stroke go by, and waved at a serve while holding his racquet in his left hand. Alcaraz was up 40-15, and the air had gone out of the arena, as Zverev looked ready to wave the white flag.

He let one ground stroke go by, and waved at a serve while holding his racquet in his left hand. Alcaraz was up 40-15, and the air had gone out of the arena, as Zverev looked ready to wave the white flag.

Somehow, Alcaraz found a way to keep Zverev in it for longer than seemed possible, or healthy for the German. Alcaraz double faulted four times in that game alone, and sent a forehand long at break point. Zverev was alive, and a few minutes later Alcaraz was letting out a scream of disbelief.“All of a sudden he started feeling really bad,” Alcaraz said. “And then my focus, I started thinking about how he's feeling, besides focusing on myself and playing good tennis.”All's well that ends well, of course, for Alcaraz. In this case, all's well that starts well, too. The first set was a good one from both guys, with sharp, all-court rallies and a mix of power and touch. Most promising for Alcaraz was the way he dug himself out of a 0-40 hold at 2-3, and then turned around and broke serve at 3-3. He saved two of those break points with deft forehand drop shots, and broke Zverev by sticking a crosscourt backhand volley a foot from the sideline. From there, Alcaraz's serve started to click, and he finished with 11 aces in nine service games.

“We started the match really good, good rallies, good level of tennis,” Alcaraz said, lamenting the fact that it didn't stay that way.While Zverev made the semifinal at a Masters 1000 this week, his physical state is concerning going into the US Open. This was the second straight night where he struggled to breathe and move, sweated much more than is normal for him, and was forced to call the doctor onto the court. It has been hot and humid in Cincinnati, but he played both of those matches in the evening, when the worst of the weather had past.If Zverev is already thinking of New York, Alcaraz has one more piece of business to attend to in Cincinnati. A pretty big piece of business, in fact: Another final with Jannik Sinner, their fourth of 2025.

What can he take from Saturday's semi into Monday's finale? On the plus side, he can be hopeful about his serve, and how much it can help him on these fast courts. On the minus side, he showed signs against Zverev that a second-set letdown was coming, something that had already happened to him twice here. Who knows how the set would have played out if Zverev had been healthy.But all of that is in the past, and now Alcaraz and Sinner can ascend into their private stratosphere, with the sports world as happy spectators again. Alcaraz, who is coming off a loss to Sinner at Wimbledon last month, sounds like he's not going to settle for anything less than his best this time around.“We really bring out beautiful tennis,” Alcaraz said of their Top 2 rivalry. “I'm ready for the challenge. Just to be ready and perfect.”

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

F1.com catches up with reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen midway through a rollercoaster 2025 season.

Max Verstappen finds himself in territory he's not experienced since 2020 – driving at a high level, but without a car capable of fighting consistently for race wins and the championship.

On the face of it, he seems to be taking it reasonably well. The 27-year-old became a serial winner between 2021-2024, securing 56 of his 65 Grand Prix triumphs during that period.

He scooped up the championship in all four seasons, too. Winning had become the norm. This season, though, it has been anything but as rivals McLaren are a class above the rest.

Disney's 'Freakier Friday' also beat the $9.3 million domestic opening of Bob Odenkirk's action-comedy 'Nobody' sequel with a second-weekend haul of $14.5 million. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Bob Odenkirk's modestly budgeted sequel Nobody 2 is having to settle for a third-place finish in its domestic box office debut as Zach Cregger's Weapons continues to fire on all cylinders and stay atop the chart in its sophomore outing, followed by Disney's family comedy Freakier Friday.


Nobody 2, about a seemingly average suburban dad who leads a double life as a stealth operative, is on course to open on the lower end of expectations with $9.3 million from 3,260 locations after receiving a B+ CinemaScore from audiences (its audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes is more promising at 89 percent). Its early global total is $14.2 million.

	The first Nobody opened amid the pandemic to $6.8 million on its way to grossing a pleasing $68 million domestically. The sequel cost a modest $25 million to make before marketing, so no one at Universal is losing sleep, since it is sure to make up ground when hitting premium VOD as early as three weeks from now (the studio has perfected the art of PVOD).

	From New Line and Warner Bros., Weapons had no trouble staying atop the chart in its sophomore outing with an estimated $25 million from 3,450 locations — a scant decline of 43 percent. That's a rare feat for a horror film, and cements the movie's status as a water-cooler sensation. Overseas, it dropped 33 percent to $18.4 million for an early worldwide total of $148.8 million in yet another win for Warners, which paid $38 million for rights to the project.

	











	The female-skewing Freakier Friday, reteaming Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, is likewise grinning in its sophomore outing with an estimated haul $14.5 million from 3,975 cinemas for a worldwide cume of $86.3 million against a budget under $45 million. The body-swap comedy fell 50 percent domestically. 


Nobody 2 isn't the weekend's only new player, but it is by far doing the best of the bunch.


	Spike Lee's prestige pic Highest 2 Lowest, which reunites him for the first time in 18 years with Denzel Washington, is opening in select theaters before debuting relatively quickly on Apple TV+ in early September. While Apple is making a major push into theatrical — F1: The Movie is one of the summer's biggest blockbusters and is getting a traditional release in cinemas — Highest 2 Lowest doesn't appear to be part of that strategy.


	A24, which partnered with Apple on Lee's latest movie, isn't making grosses public so far, but those with visibility into numbers being reported by some theaters suggest Highest 2 Lowest is doing tepid business for a movie with such a high-profile director and cast, who gathered together for a splashy world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May.


	The Lionsgate-distributed Americana — starring Sydney Sweeney opposite Paul Walter Hauser and Halsey — is bombing in its nationwide debut in 1,123 theaters. The pic opened to an estimated $500,000 for a sixteenth-place finish. The crime-heist movie, which has been well received by critics, has taken more than two years to arrive on the big screen after first premiering at SXSW in 2023. Lionsgate insists the film is part of a multi-platform strategy, including premium VOD, and that its box office performance is in no way a disappointment, financial or otherwise.

	











Americana opens in the wake of a media firestorm engulfing Sweeney after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. Almost overnight, some TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” They claimed the comments promote eugenics since Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. While countless users dismissed such theories as utter nonsense, the debate went viral. Even President Donald Trump weighed in after The Guardian reported that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida prior to the 2024 election.


More to come.

Friday (Aug. 15) was the late rapper's birthday.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



In honor of Nipsey Hussle‘s legacy on what would have been his 40th birthday (Aug. 15), the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) temporarily renamed Hyde Park station as Nipsey Hussle Station. Two limited edition TAP cards featuring the late rapper were also released on Friday as part of the L.A. transit agency's Metro x Culture series, which highlights the city's cultural landscape, artists, musicians and community figures.

	“The Hussle family is proud to be partnering with Metro for the renaming of the station in honor of Nipsey for his 40th birthday,” Nipsey's family says in a statement released at the campaign's launch. “Access to Metro played a vital role in providing transportation from South Central to Watts to pursue his early musical aspirations. Metro helped bridge the gap, not just between neighborhoods, but between his vision and his future. Metro provides access and opportunity to so many people who without this resource wouldn't be able to pursue their passions. The family hopes insight to Hussle's early years utilizing the Metro will bring light to Hussle's favorite quote, ‘The highest human act is to inspire.'”

	The TAP card designs — available in a release limited to 12,000 at select Metro station ticket vending machines, Metro Customer Care centers and through Metro's LIFE Program — include “Crenshaw & Slauson,” which shows a black-and-white portrait of Hussle at the intersection captured by photographer Jonathan Mannion, and “Watts” (seen below), which depicts the rapper on a Metro bus.

	











	The station known in the short-term as Nipsey Hussle Station will hold on to its new name through Aug. 31.Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins notes, “Hussle's legacy goes far beyond music. He was a visionary who understood the power of community, connection and opportunity. At Metro, we share his belief that public transportation is more than just a way to get around; it's a vital lifeline that can unite neighborhoods, open doors and uplift lives. Honoring Hussle with these commemorative TAP cards and temporarily renaming the Hyde Park station is our way of celebrating his enduring impact on Los Angeles and reaffirming our commitment to building an accessible, inclusive transit system that serves all Angelenos.”


	Nipsey Hussle died in 2019. He was murdered in a daytime shooting in front of his Marathon Clothing store in South Central Los Angeles.

	Three years after its six-season run ended, Bob Odenkirk doesn't expect Better Call Saul to escape from behind bars anytime soon.


	Although he didn't sound optimistic about a revival of the Breaking Bad spin-off, which ran for six seasons on AMC from 2015 to '22, Odenkirk said “of course I would” reprise his role as the titular scam artist/lawyer Saul Goodman.


	“That part turned my life around, and I've given more to that part than anything I've done,” he said on Today. “Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. They are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV. So if they were to think of something in that world, of course I would do it.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Odenkirk added of the possibility, “But I don't think so. I think they've all moved on to some more amazing projects that you'll soon see.”


	In the Aug. 15, 2022 series finale ‘Saul Gone', Saul takes responsibility for years of his criminal activity, including his work with Walter White, resulting in an 86-year prison sentence.


	“He's not getting out [of prison]. If there's another Saul show, it takes place inside prison,” added Odenkirk of a potential revival.


	After Breaking Bad‘s five-season run from 2008 to 2013, Better Call Saul followed Saul Goodman six years before he got tangled up in Walter White's criminal enterprise. The show was nominated for multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Awards.

I'd give anything to see a BCS spinoff featuring Rhea Seehorn as Kim. She obviously walked away from Jimmy but her life would be a compelling narrative. Only if handled by the same writers and show runners as BCS of course!

Charisma Carpenter addressed fan speculation she would be returning to the queen bee character that first catapulted her to fame in the forthcoming reboot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 


	In a TikTok video posted today, the actress — who appeared as Cordelia Chase in both the mothership series and Angel spinoff — debunked any rumors she would be in the new show.


	“Hey, I get asked this a lot: ‘Are you doing the reboot?' And I thought I would address it,” she began in response to a comment. “I am not in the reboot. I am not in the pilot. I don't even know if the show has been picked up to go to series. I assume it will be.”

	Carpenter then addressed the launch of her new Buffy rewatch podcast titled The Bitch Is Back, the name of which she dispelled was associated with any kind of return to the Buffyverse.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It was not intended to sound coded in any kind of way, alluding to the fact that I was admitting to being in the reboot,” she said. “People were also then commenting, ‘Oh is this… Are you saying?' like it was an easter egg à la Taylor Swift. Not at all.” 


	She concluded, “I have not had a conversation with any of the powers that be to include Cordelia at this point.”


	Carpenter's statement comes after previous comments she made last month saying she was “so hopeful” to be included in the new iteration, given what she considered an “unjust” ending for the mainstay character.


	Carpenter's Cordelia was one of the original characters in the supernatural drama for the first three seasons. She continued playing the role in the 1999 Angel spinoff for an additional four seasons before being killed off in the fifth and final season. 

	











	As evidenced by star Sarah Michelle Gellar's dual resurrections, deaths in Buffy aren't as absolute. Previously, the actress, who is also executive producing the offshoot, expressed her desire to bring back characters on the show who had died while ensuring “space [is] made for new stories as well.”


	The sequel series, which currently has a pilot order at Hulu, will feature Oscar winner and self-described Buffy fanatic Chloé Zhao directing from a script penned by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman (Poker Face). In addition to Gellar and new slayer Ryan Kiera Armstrong, cast members include Faly Rakotohavana, Ava Jean, Sarah Bock, Daniel Di Tomasso and Jack Cutmore-Scott, as well as guest star/recurring cast members Merrin Dungey, Audrey Hsieh, Audrey Grace Marshall and Kingston Vernes. Chase Sui Wonders will also have a one-off guest-starring role in the pilot.

It's too early to tell. They're only filming the pilot so far and then Hulu/Disney will decide if they want it to become a show. Once that happens then they'll start filming the rest and cast other characters that aren't in the pilot. So like Charisma said she still wouldn't know yet if Cordelia is even in season one until it gets picked up. Even then since this show is focused more on the new slayer Nova and Buffy herself is a recurring character, they'll likely only bring in other “Buffy” characters when it's needed for the storylines.

Cordelia returning to Sunnyvale would be a great foil for Buffy. They have history and sometimes you do go back “home”.

Buddy, sunnyvale is now a giant crater. Ain't no returning there xD

I replied to correct Sunnydale, then my phone auto corrected to Sunnyvale, so I get it, friend lol… Really hope Cordelia and Faith make an appearance eventually. I hope Eliza comes outta retirement for this 🤞🏾☺️🤞🏾

Cordelia is dead in the Buffy verse, she can't just go back

It's possible that they are waiting for the show to get picked up or even see if it's a hit before trying to bring back a deep cut like Cordelia. At least, I hope so.

I don't feel like Cordelia's a deep cut. Even if she wasn't originally part of the Scoobys, she was a main character on the show as well as on Angel.

Maybe Charisma and Jennifer Love Hewitt could do something together?

That's nasty. There's no beef between SMG and Charisma.

…that we know of.

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


Pete Davidson is reflecting on the time he was in “trouble” with NBCUniversal over the cancellation of his semi-autobiographical dramedy Bupkis on Peacock.


	In a sprawling interview conducted recently with The Breakfast Club, the Saturday Night Live alum candidly discussed everything from his sobriety to the tabloid fixation on his personal life. He also touched on his choice to end Bupkis after one season last year, which he said at the time was informed by wanting “a chance to tell my story my way” after having “nearly a decade of my personal life being in the media.”

	“I canceled Bupkis and I got in trouble for it 'cause I didn't— I love that show, I loved doing Bupkis, I had a blast, thank you [host Charlamagne tha God] for being in it,” he began. “It just got to a point where I got really tired of my whole career just being my personal life, and living through that is sort of traumatic — not to be lame — but it's traumatic to live in your own crap all the time.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Despite writing storylines in the series that he was “comfortable” with, Davidson said the show's direction took a turn once a new collaborator stepped in.


The Pickup star explained, “This new person came and was like: ‘I think Pete should be banging Martha Stewart this season, I think Pete should have more mental issues.' And I was like, ‘Oh, but I wouldn't do that.' And they were like, ‘Well, Pete the character [would].' And I was like, ‘I can't do this.' I was like, if I want any shot in being in real movies or being seen a certain way, I can't just play myself all the time and be this sack.”

	











	Speaking to how parent company NBCUniversal took the news, Davidson said: “They were not pleased. Have you seen me in any NBCUniversal [project since]? They were upset. I cost people jobs and I took care of the writers' room and anyone who didn't get paid that needed to, I took care of it — which also hurt. But, it's funny, you work for a company for over a decade — I'm pretty sure I brought in a lot of money, worked hard on that show, was a good boy, like promoting [it] and whatnot. It made me realize a lot about the business, like hey, I'm probably gonna die if I have to keep doing this and that's a problem.”


	While the Bodies, Bodies, Bodies actor called himself “very lucky” to enjoy success in the entertainment industry, he added that it “did kind of open my eyes where it's just like, ‘Oh, no one actually cares about you.' Studios, networks — they don't really care about you. They want you to do the thing, which I get. Now it's all good, but there was a time where it wasn't.”


	When asked if he was “blacklisted” by NBC over the decision, he said, “No, I think we're cool. I talk to everyone over there now and we're cool. There was a little time where there was some heat and it wasn't all good … and I understand why, but it just hurt because it was a place I worked for over a decade,” adding that there was a time he thought it “might be a wrap” on his career.


	Admitting he “had to step back and be in purgatory for a little bit,” Davidson also credited his ad with clothing brand Reformation in helping him “start to switch the narrative” and be seen as an “adult” in the public eye.


	Davidson can currently be seen on Prime Video's The Pickup opposite Eddie Murphy and Keke Palmer. Next up, he will co-star alongside Nicholas Hoult in Amazon MGM Studios' How to Rob a Bank, from director David Leitch.

I love Pete and this show. It's funny bc I first heard of bupkis on an old dick van dyke show where he'd written a song called Turkish, many years ago

I really loved this show!!! Just told my family to watch it…. couldn't wait for it to start again hate that he ended it but I understand

I imagine Peacock was pretty happy having a TV series starring Joe Pesci.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU: After Saturday post… Summer is now in its August sleep with the overall weekend for all titles falling under $100M for the second time this season with an estimated $93M per ComScore. The last time this happened in 2025 was during the second weekend of summer, May 9-11, when all movies grossed just over $84M per Box Office Mojo. While summer at $3.4 billion remains ahead of last year's heat wave by +2%, as we mentioned last weekend, we're unlikely to hit $4 billion mark. The last time summer did that, was pre-Covid.  


	As we said earlier this week, thank God Warner Bros moved Weapons into the late summer, or else we wouldn't be feeling a pulse. The Zach Cregger pic's hold for weekend 2 stands at -43% for a second frame of $25M after a $7.4M Friday and Saturday of $9.6M, +29%. 

	











	While Weapons isn't having the dips of Get Out (-15%) and Sinners (-5%) in its second weekend, any time a horror movie is holding better than -50%, that's remarkable, and this original horror movie is posting a second weekend that's better than 2025's other big horror pics, Final Destination: Bloodlines (-63%) and 28 Years Later (-68%). Weapons has PLF and Imax, the latter grossing $1.8M stateside for a $10.5M running cume in weekend 2. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Global for Weapons, which only cost New Line $38M+, stands at $148.8M.


	Disney's Freakier Friday looks to come in with a second weekend at $14.5M, -49%.


	Universal's Bob Odenkirk uber-violent action sequel Nobody 2 despite solid exits of a B+ CinemaScore (the first one received an A-) and 4 stars and a 62% definite recommend on Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, is coming in softer than expected with a $9.25M opening after a $3.8M Friday and Saturday of $3.1M. The movie was cheap at net $25M before P&A spend, and clearly this is a Lionsgate model meat and potato action movie aimed at older dudes (the overall 45+ set who showed up at 40%). In fact, Lionsgate's winter action movies did better with Den of Thieves 2 at $15M and Flight Risk at $11.5M. However, what's unfortunate here is that the audience (at least from a dollar-wise perspective) for Nobody 2 didn't expand that much from the original's opening, which posted $6.8M. With moviegoers skittish about returning to cinemas after Covid when the first title opened in 2021, the following for this IP has only grown so much. No John Wick phenomenon going on here with this 87North production. The original John Wick, similar to the first Austin Powers, boomed on home entertainment fueling bigger theatrical openings and grosses for its part 2. It's unfortunate for Nobody as these movies are a great homage to Steve McQueen titles like The Hunter and Clint Eastwood movies such as Every Which Way But Loose. Nobody 2 has PLFs which are driving 29% of the weekend with an even play across the country, however, prominent in the West. AMC Burbank 16 is the single leading venue with just over $28K through Saturday night. Diversity demos for the overall 68% male leaning movie were 52% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic and Latino, 12% Black and 8% Asian American.

	











	Clearly, the fans were carrying the torch for Nobody 2 on social with RelishMix noticing overall positive sentiment and very little negative chatter. The social media universe for the sequel at close to 190M was 59% above action-drama genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined. During Covid, the first movie's stats were 53% lighter. Interesting to note that the social media reach on Rami Malek's The Amateur was lower at 89M, but that movie opened higher at $14.8M.


	Sunday box office numbers updated in bold:


FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: Currently, New Line's original horror movie Weapons is seeing a second weekend -49% decline with $22M after a second Friday of $6M at 3,450 sites. The ten-day on the Zach Cregger directed, written and produced movie is bound to hit $86M by Sunday.


	Disney's Freakier Friday is seeing a $4.5M second Friday, with a $14M-$15M second frame at 3,975 and -48% decline for a ten-day of $55M. That total will be -6% behind the end of second weekend cume of the original 2003 movie which ended its run at $110.2M. 


	Universal's Nobody 2 is right now standing at a $9.25M opening after a first Friday plus previews of $3.8M at 3,260 sites. 


	Disney/Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four: First Steps at 3,355 theaters has a fourth Friday of $2.3M, fourth weekend of $8M, -49% for a running cume by Sunday of $246.1M. 


	Third weekend of Uni/DreamWorks Animation's Bad Guys 2 is $5.7M, -46%, for a running total of $55.4M at 3,374. That total will be pacing -3% behind Bad Guys through 17 days. Today is $1.6M.  


FRIDAY AM: Summer is ratcheting down and the only major studio wide entry this box office frame is Universal's Bob Odenkirk action movie Nobody 2, which did $1.3 million from previews Thursday at 2,800 theaters that began at 2 p.m. The $25M 87North feature production is eyeing a $10M+ start in a marketplace where New Line's Weapons is expected to rule with $20M+.


	The Zach Cregger-directed Weapons ends its first week with $64M, which is 17% behind Sinners' first week of $77.5M but 29% ahead of Get Out‘s $49.8M first week. Sinners ended its run at $278.5M and Get Out finaled at $176M. Whether Weapons has a slight dip ala Get Out‘s second frame (-15%) or Sinners (-5%) we'll know when we get into the thick of Saturday. Sinners saw a spike in its second Saturday over its first by 14%, while Get Out‘s second Saturday dipped 9%. Weapons‘ Thursday was $4.06M, off 9% from Wednesday's $4.4M.


	There weren't any previews on the first Nobody as major New York City and Los Angeles cinemas had just reopened roughly two weeks prior from Covid; that movie opened to $6.8M and finaled at $27.5M domestic. Previews here on Nobody 2 are right in line with Lionsgate's Den of Thieves: Pantera, which posted $1.35M in its Thursday before a $5.7M Friday and $15M opening. Russian director Ilya Naishuller directed the first Nobody installment, while Timo Tjahjanto has taken over helming reins on part 2 here. Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin wrote the screenplay based on the former's characters.

	











	Great grades on Nobody 2: 82% certified fresh critics and 92% audience on Rotten Tomatoes. That's not far from the first installment, which respectively did 84% and 94% with critics and audiences.


	The rest of top 5 for the week is as follows:

It's crazy that sequel are doing poorly while originals are exploding, instead of the other way other. Let's hope the trend for original project doing good in the box office continue.

I am not sure if that's really true. None of the last year's top grossing movies was an original (Inside Out 2, Deadpool, Moana 2, and Despicable Me 4). This year is better for originals but most of the top grossing movies are an establish IP (Lilo and Stitch, Jurassic World, How to Train…)

Don't worry, the Hollywood execs won't notice.

I miss the good ole days – when a movie didn't have to knock it out of the park opening weekend and there was a dearth of all kinds of movies to go see! Sigh!!!!

“Dearth” means lack, so maybe you mean a “glut” of all kinds of movies?  In any case, I do agree that long theatrical windows and a healthy variety at the multiplex are sorely missed 😕

Enter the doldrums of several weeks of 25 box office being behind 24. (After the last several weeks already).

Weapons is def coming in higher than $22 mil. It keeps beating expectations

Guess nobody will watch nobody 2.

I suspect the theatrical release is just to raise the film's profile for VOD and streaming, which is where the real money will be made.

Nobody's paying off a bunch of critics. I just think critics tend to be terminally online and prone to groupthink. I'll never be able to prove it, but I believe the RT scores of certain movies would be vastly different if each critic were to watch it in a vacuum. You get movies like Joker and Megalopolis where critics see everyone dunking on it for cultural or political reasons and decide to get in on the dog pile, and you see movies on the other end of the spectrum like Barbie where critics see everyone heaping praise on it and wouldn't dare to go against the narrative. 

And yes, I think Barbie was “better” than Joker and Megalopolis, but it doesn't take away from the fact that there are too many critics and many of them share opinions that have been crowd-sourced. They're paid off with likes and attention, not money.

“I'll never be able to prove it, but I believe…” the eternal motto of the conspiracy theorist.

Television

Or just someone observing human behavior. Admitting you see patterns but can't be certain doesn't mean you're wrong, it means you're smart enough to know and disclose you can't prove your hypothesis.

That one person keeps posting here week after week that it's “a fact” and “obvious” that RT/CinemaScore/critics are being “paid off” without having a shred of actual evidence.

This was meant as a reply to a different comment.

Guess everybody will watch nobody 2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Brandi Glanville is One Step Closer To Treating Her Mysterious Facial Infection","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/brandi-glanville-treating-facial-infection/","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 04:08:36 GMT","

Brandi Glanville is hopeful that an infectious disease specialist in New York City is going to help her get to the bottom of her facial illness.

The former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star is in treatment with Dr. Michael Scoma, whose first course is getting the reality star on antibiotics and antifungals, per Us Weekly. 

“I always joke my life is like ‘The Last of Us?' I'm just turning into one of those black mold people. That's how I felt. I have lumps on my face, and they're moving around,” Glanville told the outlet.

She said of her condition, “Dr Michael Scoma said he wouldn't know if there was a parasite or not, because he didn't treat me early on.”

“But if there was, it would have been gone by now. A lot of this infection, in this deep tissue — the staph infection, and there's other problems happening — it mimics a parasite. It has this fluid that jumps around your face because it's spreading,” the mom of two continued. 

Glanville, who first noticed strange lumps on her face after filming “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip” in 2023, is hopeful that Dr. Scoma's treatment plan will clear her symptoms.

She discovered that she had a parasitic infection, and the lumps had spread to her upper body, causing a sensation of movement.

Now, the plan is to treat the infection and manage Glanville's stress, which can exacerbate her condition.

Dr. Scoma remains positive and told Us Weekly, “We can expect to see meaningful progress within the next few weeks, and I do believe Brandi can make a full recovery.”

A post shared by Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville)

Glanville is on her way to being rid of her parasitic infection. In an Instagram post shared on August 14, she told fans, “They say Twitter is the devil but all it took was me screaming in my tweets asking for help for this lovely man to reach out.”

“Thank you so much to Michael R. Scoma, M.D who specializes in infectious diseases for taking the time to meet with me and help me try to figure out what is going on inside,” she wrote.

The first picture shows Glanville with a much smoother face, while the third documents a shot of her getting an IV treatment.

Bravolebrities offered their support, with “RHOC” star Vicki Gunvalson writing, “Praying honey you find answers! I love your new haircut and you are looking fabulous.”

Sheree Whitfield of “RHOA” replied, “Hopefully, he can help and give u the answers and clarity u need!”

Glanville said in an interview with ET on August 12 that she was treated for parasites upon returning from Morocco in 2023. 

“If it was a parasite, that part is gone, but with all the inflammation … they left me with a secondary infection,” she explained. 

She said that numerous doctors couldn't diagnose her, with some blaming her fillers. “I haven't had fillers before COVID,” Glanville told ET. 

“I saw 21 doctors, and I had to have a tooth pulled,” the former model said, adding that she spent over $100K in medical bills.

When she's over her medical crisis, Glanville hopes to return to reality television, but she wants to do a game show. “They're fun. No one gets hurt,” she said.

Sho Miyake is one of the finest, most soulful Japanese filmmakers of his generation. His recent features, all patiently-paced dramas about circumstantial relationships, share a compelling interest in the quiet. Not necessarily tranquility; almost every Miyake lead is outright depressed or a bundle of nerves about key issues in their life. 

Rather, he favors characters who struggle with loneliness, withdrawing from engaging with people much at all due to factors that make human connection harder for them. “All the Long Nights” saw two office workers suffering from different detrimental conditions form a supportive bond to ease their respective pains. And in Miyake's gorgeous, lo-fi take on a sports movie, “Small, Slow but Steady,” the quiet demeanor of its young boxer protagonist is due to a literal hearing impairment. She reads lips to understand people, while choosing to not articulate many of her inner thoughts.In Miyake's latest tender, beautifully textured feature (which just won Locarno's highest honor, the Golden Leopard), “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the main character's tendency to say very little is rooted in a creative slump, intertwined with cultural isolation. Li (Shim Eun-kyung, “Train to Busan”) is a Korean screenwriter for film and television, experiencing writer's block and struggling to still connect to her surroundings in Japan, where she's been based for years. At a Q&A session, she seems scared to answer the first question, suggesting that her main takeaway from watching her own work is that she doesn't have much talent.Within her own mind, she's a little more articulate. Japanese is the only language that leaves Li's mouth, but her occasional inner monologues are in her mother tongue, the most crucial example expressing her growing conflict with the very act of writing itself.

“Things happen in life that can't be put into words,” she thinks. “Surprise and bewilderment blow me far away. I want to just stand there forever, far away from words. But words always take hold of me without fail. Everyday life is about naming the things and feelings around us and blending in. When I first came to Japan, everything around me was full of mystery and fear. The things and feelings that used to be fresh have now been overtaken by words. I'm in a cage of words. Maybe travel is about trying to get away from words.”Traveling to get away from the noise of urban life, in the hope it might provide greater clarity or purpose, drives both female protagonists in Miyake's film of two distinct halves. Contrasting Li, whose trip occurs in the winter, is Nagisa (Yuumi Kawai, “Desert of Namibia”), a young Japanese woman wandering a seaside town in the summer. Avoiding the tourist traps, she connects, albeit awkwardly, with Natsuo (Mansaku Takada), a similarly lonely soul visiting his relatives nearby.Miyake's “All the Long Nights” was adapted from a novel by Maiko Seo and “Small, Slow but Steady” was loosely based on ​the autobiography of boxer Keiko Ogasawara. With “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the writer/director once again draws inspiration from previously published material, though while his switch to bringing manga to live-action might seem like a curveball, the creator he's adapting is an ideal match for the filmmaker's skill with bringing real interiority to fable-like storytelling.The hugely influential cartoonist and essayist Yoshiharu Tsuge is regarded as the first manga artist to have mined his personal life for story material, alongside being the first to make his characters' internal conflicts the central focus of his narratives — something uncommon in the medium until the late 1960s, even in the gekiga style of Japanese comics aimed at adult audiences. His introspective works would range from stories of ordinary life to more overt surrealism, their atmospheres tinged with dreaminess, eroticism and mysterious tensions.

“Two Seasons, Two Strangers” loosely adapts two specific manga short stories by Tsuge. In pairing the otherwise unconnected comics, Miyake doesn't quite follow the template of Jacques Audiard's recent “Paris, 13th District,” which interweaved the plots of three previously separate short stories by American cartoonist Adrian Tomine. Rather, to start with, Miyake makes Li the screenwriter of an adaptation of Tsuge's 1967 story “Scenes from the Seaside.” 

The film opens on Li at her desk, silently working out how to begin her screenplay's first scene. Bar the occasional cut back to Li writing a few more words, roughly the first 35 minutes of “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” are devoted to a take on “Scenes from the Seaside,” starring the aforementioned characters of Nagisa and Natsuo.The fleeting but fulfilling chance encounter between the two young loners has the air of a meet-cute tale, and there's certainly a romantic feel to how their situation develops. After first meeting at a secluded stretch of beach, they spend the rest of the day walking and talking, scheduling a second hangout at the same beach spot the following day. When a typhoon hits the town, neither is deterred from honoring their plans. Sheltered by a hut, he sits and waits for her as torrential showers surround him. When she shows up, they share dessert that he brought, both of them wearing what they would have anyway if the sun had kept shining, to the extent that Nagisa has a bikini ready underneath her dress to swim with Natsuo in the rain-drenched ocean.Despite the seemingly sweet resolution to their storyline (and an ostensibly upbeat last line of dialogue), there's a strange undercurrent to the Nagisa and Natsuo segment that suggests foreboding as much as potential happiness — a mysterious tension befitting the creator that Miyake is adapting. For one thing, their theoretically sensual swim occurs in stormy weather, the camera operator in the water with the actors clearly getting battered by the waves and heavy downpour. Elsewhere, part of their bonding is based around Natsuo sharing a grim childhood anecdote about seeing the bodies of drowning victims.Within the universe of “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the dark layer to the movie-within-a-movie can be read as a reflection of Li's despaired mind. The rest of Miyake's film finds Li years after her Tsuge adaptation was written, still stuck on the idea of traveling from the tale of Nagisa and Natsuo as she struggles to write another project — apparently about ninjas. The magic structural trick that Miyake pulls with Li is that she herself is the protagonist of another Tsuge story: an adaptation of “Mr. Ben and His Igloo.”

On Tsuge's page, that story concerns a male manga artist in search of inspiration, traveling to a remote village and staying with an eccentric innkeeper (barely) operating a business on its outskirts. In Miyake's film, Li finally travels away from the city to deal with both burnout and the aftermath of a sudden tragedy, trying out a deserted mountain inn run by the cynical Benzo (Shinichi Tsutsumi), after every other option in the snow-draped town lacks vacancies. The pair's initially stiff but gradually warm chats echo and augment those from Li's previous screenplay, including bonding over an understanding of deep loneliness.The build-up to the film's low-key, poetic resolution is made all the more moving by Shim's intelligent performance, which is effectively informed by the actor's positioning between two languages throughout, giving her a platform and reason to convey additional emotional nuances without dialogue — the performer, in a sense, also breaking free from “a cage of words” like her character. 

 










When working things out for the next chapter of our lives, we could all stand to get out of our own heads more to properly appreciate and take inspiration from the possibilities before us, instead of overthinking and then over-vocalizing our worries and doubts to the point of blocking our progress. To nod to a famous song that, like Miyake's filmmaking, suggests enjoying the silence where possible, sometimes words are very unnecessary.

Some musical discoveries function like a subway station: They become hubs for vibrant lines connecting clubs, lofts, and basement studios. Others are like stalls in a bustling marketplace, or a popped trunk in a parking lot, promising the best of the block.

But there is a type of music that's a dead end. You can't easily connect it to a scene or a label. It's not some treasure to be imparted—you hand it to someone like a furtive cigarette. There's no romance, no mystery other than how it got recorded. It may be unclear who the music was ever for, but it's against seemingly everything: lyricism, artistic remove, conventional rhythmic sense. For most people, that kind of art prompts a quick jab at the stop button and dark thoughts about delusion or mental illness. For a select few, it represents the last frontier of musical expression.

For decades, author, producer, and archivist Irwin Chusid has been patrolling that frontier with X-ray spex and a ray gun. A self-described ""connoisseur of marginalia,” Chusid has been a DJ on New Jersey's legendary freeform radio station WFMU since 1975. In the early '90s, he was scraping by on freelance writing and producing albums: at one point, his parents were loaning him $50 a month so he could eat. His fortunes shifted when Bar/None Records asked him for a reissue pitch, and he suggested the experimental big-band producer Juan Garcia Esquivel. 1994's Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music—like the Stereolab EP from the year prior, named after a phrase coined by animator and exotica collector Byron Werner in the 1970s—sold a shocking 70,000 copies, helping move the lounge revival mainstream.

Chusid's other work during the decade (reissues of forgotten bandleader and electronic-music pioneer Raymond Scott, liner notes for Rhino's Golden Throats series of singing celebrities, producing R. Stevie Moore) showed someone able to make a meal out of bygone (or bad) tastes. But it was a little-noticed reissue of a laughably obscure 1969 album that changed Chusid's destiny: Into Outer Space with Lucia Pamela. Chusid first heard Into Outer Space in 1984, when a WFMU listener mailed him a homemade tape. It took him four years to obtain an original copy, and another three before he got it released on Boston's Arf! Arf! label.

Lucia Pamela was a bon vivant and lifelong entertainer. In 1926, she was named Miss St. Louis; in the '30s and '40s, she led the all-women big band Lucia Pamela and the Musical Pirates. After the group disbanded, she reportedly played accordion for Lionel Hampton and Paul Whiteman; she also performed at USO shows with her daughter Georgia, billed as the Pamela Sisters. When Lucia was 65, she recorded her only album, a zany, jazzy romp that she would insist was recorded on the moon. According to legend, she played every instrument, but it's also possible she kidnapped a Dixieland combo at gunpoint. The prevailing spirit is that of a public-access kids' show running on fumes and flopsweat; her voice is all brass and zero polish. In college, I found that the 90-second closing track “In the Year 2,000!” was the perfect way to pad a mix CD's runtime. “We'll even play football too, on the year 2000!” she hollers. (In January 2000, as it happens, the St. Louis Rams won their first Super Bowl. The team's owner was Georgia Frontiere, Lucia Pamela's daughter.)

The Into Outer Space reissue didn't move the needle, but the project had a deep effect on Chusid. For several years, he had hosted a radio show called Atrocious Music. It was filled with audacious camp: Golden Throats-type performances, school bands, Bible-thumping records, and the occasional bizarro record like Into Outer Space. But after meeting Lucia Pamela—by then in her late 80s, living in a bungalow outside the Rams' offices—Chusid changed the show's name to Incorrect Music. “I just began to realize that I need to respect these people a bit more,” he told Perfect Sound Forever in 2007. “And deal with them on their own terms, rather than dealing with them as a zookeeper.” A few years later, when a publisher asked Chusid for a book pitch, exotica didn't come to mind. But Lucia Pamela did.

Released at the decadent height of the CD Age, when pop's biggest stars were routinely moving a million albums a week, Songs in the Key of Z (simultaneously released as a book and album) was the first major attempt to define and survey “outsider music.” The album presents 20 songs from the late '60s to the mid-'90s, all recorded by artists on the musical fringe. Some of them were artists Chusid had first shared on WFMU; others were thrift-store finds or esoterica passed around record-collector circles. In a departure from the way outsider music was generally conceived, several cuts were pulled from so-called “vanity” records: limited-run, self-released albums that were previously only of interest to hardcore cratediggers.

Previously, most compilations of out-there songs (like Arf! Arf!'s Only in America, or the two-volume Incredibly Strange Music set issued by V. Vale and Andrea Juno's venerable RE/Search zine) fixated on cash-out novelties: sitar covers of pop hits, teensploitation documentaries, lounge atrocities. The ones that dug deeper were narrower in focus. The four-volume MSR Madness series from indie-comics publisher Carnage Press was solely devoted to song-poems, a mail-order hustle that converted amateur lyrics into recordings banged out by beleaguered studio rats. Arf! Arf!'s 1996 release, The Talent Show, documented a Boston church's amateur night in 1981, featuring performances from youth-group kids and residents of nearby nursing homes.

One of those residents was Jack Mudurian, who could breathlessly toggle between dozens of pre-WW2 pop songs. Arf! Arf! issued another of his extemporaneous medleys—clocking in at an astounding 129 songs in 47 minutes—as Downloading the Repertoire, which Chusid excerpted for Songs in the Key of Z. Mudurian—who only performed for friends, bygone ditties spilling from his clogged pipes—is the outlier on an album full of them. “Outsider music is difficult to catalog,” Chusid admitted in his book's introduction. “It's fragmented and lacking in common structural threads.” He suggested a few throughlines: artists who avoid convention instead of obeying or challenging it, a lack of commercial or critical validation, and a compulsion to create.

The closest Chusid came to a platonic ideal was in the Lucia Pamela chapter, where he noted his preference for “exotic, offbeat, calamitous, and visionary recordings—provided the artist was sincere.” His intentionally wide net caught song-poets and Living ECK Masters, Liberian legislators, and Swedish Elvis impersonators. The artists on Songs in the Key of Z released their music on private pressings and major labels. Some were championed by iconic insiders, others were ridiculed on countless radio shows. (In Tiny Tim's case, both.) Because outsider music was a foreign concept outside of hardcore record collectors and kitsch obsessives, Chusid tended to select artists with fascinating biographies. Other choices, like Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart, were selected for their “marquee value,” which should tell you something about the level of obscurity involved. Chusid was never a fan of Jandek, but the Texan avant-blues recluse was the underground's most notorious mystery: On went “They Told Me I Was a Fool,” a no-fi acoustic-glam kiss-off from his 1978 debut album.

Other than perhaps Jandek, the artists on Songs in the Key of Z have nothing in common with the banjo-toting tricksters and spectral messengers of Greil Marcus' Old, Weird America. They're more like Casper the Friendly Ghost: cheerful, underappreciated, and prone to powering through walls without a second thought. Peter Grudzien had been an out gay country musician since the '60s—in theory, prime outsider material. But he'd already been drafted by the private-press collectors, who viewed his 1974 self-produced album, The Unicorn, as prime “real people” music. The Unicorn was psychedelic yet plain-spoken, religious and randy: a horny elegy for a strain of country that never got to flourish. The album was reissued in 1995 with six new recordings; Chusid selected Grudzien's cover of “There's a Star-Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere,” a WWII-era cannon-fodder classic. Grudzien gives the lyric a queer update (“I'd see queens and dykes and fairies who would serve there”) while inexplicably yearning to fight terrorists. Imagine a gay reactionary Folkways LP with a malfunctioning metronome: Now that's outsider music.

There was no need to share credit for William “Shooby” Taylor, the Human Horn, whose recordings were hand-delivered to WFMU by their incredulous engineer. Taylor was a retired postal worker an aspiring jazz vocalist from Brooklyn. He's represented here by “Stout-Hearted Men,” a number from The New Moon, a 1920s American operetta set during the French Revolution. The text revels in the power of fraternité—an irony, as Taylor spent decades trying to connect with anyone. Jazz musicians cold-shouldered him out of the clubs; when he appeared on Amateur Night at the Apollo, he was booed off the stage within seconds. “I was hurt, very hurt,” he recalled in a 2002 WFMU interview. “I figured, oh, I did it wrong… After months and months of thinking about it, I said I did it the way how I wanted to do it!”

How did he want to do it? Playing a phantom saxophone while scatting in a grammar of his own design. Though perfectly capable of dextrous vocal runs, Taylor preferred a steady diet of open vowels, honking out shraws and splaws with abandon. On Key of Z he's accompanied by a chirpy Farfisa, though he liked to dub himself onto other musicians' recordings, even over other vocalists. That practice made a legal Shooby Taylor retrospective extremely difficult: licensing issues delayed the project until 2017.

The odd Who's in There or “Hoogie-Boogie Land” aside, outsider music is for auteurs. To collaborate is to attenuate your vision; if your collaborators somehow share your wavelength, then you're in danger of creating a scene. Captain Beefheart—an intuitive but unschooled musician who often had to draw, gesture, or whistle to his Magic Band—makes Chusid's cut. So do the miraculous Shaggs, who he correctly calls the “godmothers of outsider music.”

The Shaggs were Betty, Dot, and Helen Wiggin: three teenage sisters from a small town in Southeast New Hampshire. In 1967, for no discernable reason, their father decided that they needed to be a rock'n'roll act. Austin Wiggin pulled the girls from school, enrolling them in a musical boot camp of his own design: hours of exercising and rehearsals, a Saturday-night residency at the town hall. In 1969, the Wiggins recorded an LP, Philosophy of the World. According to legend, Austin—who called himself the band's “proprietor”—was anxious to “get them while they're hot”.

Philosophy of the World was a generation's introduction to the concept of outsider music. Chusid first encountered it in the late '70s, on R. Stevie Moore's recommendation. “We acknowledged the playing was ‘bad,' but there was also something extraordinary about it,” Chusid remembered years later. “It had a purity and guilelessness that transcended mere incompetence.” Around that time, NRBQ's Terry Adams stumbled across a copy of the album and flipped out. He worked with the Shaggs on a 1980 reissue for his Red Rooster label; the promo material compared Dot to hipster favorites like Harry Partsch and Sun Ra. In his rave writeup for the Village Voice, Lester Bangs tossed in free-jazz saxophonist Marzette Watts. As the headline implies—“Better Than the Beatles (and DNA, Too)”—he wasn't above using the Shaggs as a cudgel. His appreciation teetered between irony and sincerity, setting the tone for all outsider-music enthusiasts to follow: “How do they sound? Perfect! They can't play a lick!”

There were outsider musicians before the Shaggs, of course. Some of them were much easier to find, because they were on television. They didn't necessarily strike listeners as revolutionary: DIY salvos against midcentury monoculture or whatever. In fact, they were considered comedy acts. Elva Miller was a contentedly nonprofessional singer in Claremont, California: her retiree husband booked her sessions at a local studio, and whatever songs she pressed up she tended to give away. In the mid-1960s, some of these recordings fluttered into industry hands. Miller signed to Capital, which paired her hyperwarbled, go-for-broken vocal stylings with current pop hits. The singer resented the process—she accused her producers of recording when she was tired, cutting songs before she got a handle on them, and issuing the worst takes—but for a couple of years, she was a fixture on late-night TV, and her albums reportedly sold in the hundreds of thousands.

Mrs. Miller's unlikely success put her in the lineage of the infamously detuned diva Florence Foster Jenkins and the vaudeville-era act Cherry Sisters, whose moralistic performances were panned, heckled, and usually standing-room only. The latter two acts get entries in Chusid's book, as does Tiny Tim, who was even more famous—and much less conflicted about that fame—than Mrs. Miller. Born Herbert Khaury in 1932, he grew up obsessed with the moony crooners of bygone days. Like Jack Mudurian, Khaury had a massive store of 78s spinning in his head. But he wanted to share them with everyone. After a few years plying his act around Greenwich Village and stealing the occasional movie scene, Tiny Tim performed a brief medley—pulling his ukulele out of a shopping bag—on the 1968 debut episode of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.

He was an immediate sensation, as much for his fey manner and nearly androgynous look as for his unearthly falsetto. He was infamous for spelling out any word relating to sex, but cheerfully told one interviewer that “a woman in her prime is between the ages of twelve and eighteen."" He married the 17-year-old Victoria Budinger on The Tonight Show; 40 million people tuned in.

But unlike with Mrs. Miller, people didn't wonder whether Tiny Tim was in on the joke. They wondered whether there was a joke at all. In May of that year, Newsweek ran a Tiny Tim profile titled “The Last Innocent”. Two months later, Rolling Stone put him on the cover, with writer Jerry Hopkins describing the artist as “quite odd, but above all, gentle and beautiful.”

Odd, gentle, and beautiful: You can hear the combination in the public-access pop of B.J. Snowden's “In Canada”. The lyrics read like a mayoral proclamation written on a lunch break (“You see the ice rink glow/To the waterpark, kids can go”), but Snowden, Berklee class of '73, adds intrigue by keeping to a minor key. Her voice is free of vibrato but full of drama, the way she sings “in Saskatchewan!” like a third-act reveal has stuck with me for a quarter-century.

It may seem odd to look for a holy dimension in outsider music. Even the explicitly spiritual tunes move in mysterious ways. On “At the Grass Roots,” Sri Darwin Gross, 972nd Living ECK Master, burbles the charms of his Eckankar movement over a full Disney orchestra, cartoon bunnies and all. The uncredited “Virgin Child of the Universe” is the only song-poem on Key of Z, and it's a doozy: a cosmosexual nightmare of release, ritual, and pursuit. Its producers, blessedly, decided to track it as a Stax-style country-soul ballad.

In the visual arts, though, outsider art has long been idealized. In 1911, the modernist collective Der Blaue Reiter held an exhibition in Berlin. Like many artists of the time, they believed that the new century would become a “great spiritual epoch,” one that all art traditions were anticipating in their own way. Their exhibition placed “primitive” and folk art alongside contemporary abstract and expressionist paintings. A supplemental almanac (like Chusid, they also issued a book) reprinted over a dozen works from children. “The most important thing is not whether the form is personal, national, or has style, whether or not it is related to many or few other forms,” wrote the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. “The most important thing in the question of form is whether or not the form has grown out of inner necessity.”

In 1922, a 36-year-old German psychiatrist named Hans Prinzhorn published Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally Ill). The book profiled the work of 10 artists with schizophrenia, each in psychiatric care. It went off like fireworks in the heads of Western modernists. In Prinzhorn's subjects, they saw inner necessity: artists creating without a thought about the academy or the marketplace, effortlessly drawing from their subconscious, painting not as a profession but as an impulse. It wasn't their form that insider artists tended to imitate. It was their drive, their speed.

So it's a little funny to think about Daniel Johnston and Wesley Willis. As visual artists, their portfolios were prototypically outsider: Johnston's cartoon cosmology of spiritual combatants, Willis' beautifully hatched and gently geometric renderings of cityscapes. As musicians, they were just as distinctive: Johnston poured wry pop songs into a cheap boombox, Willis talked about bands he saw and demons he battled over preset keyboard arrangements, always tagged with a commercial slogan. But they were also hustlers. Each man built his reputation on a stream of self-released, self-illustrated albums. Each got a prominent underground co-sign: Jello Biafra released his favorite Willis tracks as a best-of on his Alternative Tentacles label; Kurt Cobain wore a Daniel Johnston “Hi, How Are You” shirt pretty much everywhere in 1992. And each parlayed their buzz into a (brief, incredible) major-label deal.

Contrary to the concept of outsider musicians as oblivious naifs, Johnston and Willis were frequently self-aware, brutally honest, and intentionally funny. Chusid quotes plenty of friends, caretakers, and collaborators saying as much. And yet, his writing keeps drifting into the language of the sideshow barker: “huggably pudgy… and disarmingly gnomelike,“ “oxlike brainpower,” “electroshock poster-boy,” “not the most appetizing of human specimens.” This, too, may be Chusid trying to meet skeptics halfway. It was an age of the marginalized becoming a mass-market spectacle: COPS was in the middle of its network run; Jerry Springer's tabloid talk show was battling its way to the top of the Nielsen ratings. There's a world in which Wesley Willis wasn't a guest on Howard Stern, but a member of his Wack Pack.

At the bottom of Key of Z's back cover are some closing commands: “Get off the focus-group treadmill. Celebrate true diversity. Go OUTSIDE for some fresh sounds.” It's a Gen-X way of saying touch grass: “outside” as a place for exploration, not exile; for play instead of pain. It's no wonder that Chusid preferred the sunnier pastures of Shooby Taylor and B.J. Snowden to Jandek's self-dug oubliette.

And so did the listening public. The year Key of Z was released, a record collector named Brian Linds bought a 23-year-old album from a British Columbia thrift store. It was a collection of pop songs performed—with extraordinary gusto—by Vancouver-area elementary schoolers. Linds alerted Chusid, who tracked down the kids' music teacher and unearthed additional recordings. Just like with Esquivel a decade prior, Bar/None agreed to release the set. Released in 2001, the Langley Schools Music Project's Innocence and Despair was a left-field hit, hailed by everyone from David Bowie to Mike White, whose School of Rock script was in part inspired by the Langley kids. Meanwhile, the stories on Key of Z continued to resonate. In the years after the album's release, nearly half its roster was featured in documentaries. Chusid oversaw three more Key of Z volumes, none of which included Jandek.

Twenty years ago this month, I was sitting in a Masonic theater, watching Jandek's first American show. I'd never even considered that he would play live—I had fully bought into the idea that Jandek was a musician who could only exist in mystery. But there he was, playing capably off a bassist and two drummers recruited specifically for that night. He was no longer someone who had to make music. He was someone who wanted to, and wanted others to witness its creation. I sat there in a daze with a couple hundred other people, all of us invited inside.

	To be Black in Martha's Vineyard in August is momentous. The first week of the month, folks ferry in for Legacy Week — which honors Historically Black Colleges and Universities — and the African American Film Festival in the historically Black neighborhood of Oak Bluffs. Two blocks away from Inkwell Beach, Oak Bluffs' waterfront, sits Nashawena Avenue, where Jane C. Edmonds — a civil rights leader and owner of two homes on the street — lives in a 10 bedroom house. In 1966, when she was just 19, her mother hired the island's only Black realtor to purchase a shanty home that peered over the water for just $3,000. “My mother looked at the property with the water view and instantly said, ‘I'm buying that house,' and paid for it in cash,” says Edmond. “She said to me, ‘You'll be glad I did this someday.'” Today, that home, along with the house she currently lives in nearby, are together worth close to $5 million. It's a legacy Edmonds' plans to keep within her family — a shared sentiment amongst the Black folks in the area, which is what first built Oak Bluffs reputation as a Black haven. “It's a magical place,” Edmonds tells me, as we head to breakfast in her grey BMW convertible. As we approach Circuit Ave., a street home to Black-owned shops like the famed gift shop C'est La Vie, we pass Barack Obama's former pastor, Rev. Otis Moss III, walking down the street. “You can run into anyone,” she says.  

	











	Oak Bluffs dates back to the 19th century, as one of the only areas in New England where Black folks could vacation with dignity. With visitors from Martin Luther King to the Obamas, it gained a reputation as a place for the affluent middle to upper class. This past July, to honor the legacy of Black residents of the area, Ralph Lauren introduced their new campaign, an Oak Bluffs beach-themed collection designed in collaboration with Morehouse and Spelman colleges. The campaign, released just ahead of Legacy Week, was led by creative director James Jeter. In it, captivating images showed Black kids in preppy and collegiate wear, lounging on the porches of million-dollar waterfront homes, overlooking Inkwell Beach. On July 23, they presented a short documentary, A Portrait of The American Dream: Oak Bluffs, directed by Cole Brown, showcasing Oak Bluffs Black history as well as the limited collection.

	Across social media, many users — both who frequented the island or aspired to — praised the campaign for its positive representation of Black life and history. Others accused the brand of catering to Black elitism, erasing the varied experiences of Black Americans involvement with the Ralph Lauren brand. Black liberation and elitism has been debated since the days of W.E.B. Dubois and Booker T. Washington. But now, off the heels of the Met Gala's latest theme — ”Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” — and shows like HBO's The Gilded Age, which explores stories of affluent Black families in the 19th Century, there's increased interest in untold stories of the Black elite. Yet in a time when political conservatism is increasing, are campaigns like Ralph Lauren's emblematic of Black American life and aspirations? Or are they reinforcing a class-based divide within Black communities?


	Part of the issue that critics have is the history of the brand. At the end of July, following the release of the campaign, DJ and curator Alexander Cobb, 35, kicked off the conversation on TikTok: “I do not want a Black all-American story when it comes to Polo Ralph Lauren because that is not how people who look like me have engaged with Polo Ralph Lauren,” he said. “It's never been about some elite bourgeois shit. We stole that shit.” Growing up in Houston — inspired by Texas artists like Pimp C who rapped “Polo horses on my bed, fuck Hilfiger” — Cobb had a different relationship to Polo. “I think the Oak Bluffs story is dope but I had a problem with Ralph Lauren telling that story because the brand has a lot to do with Americana and that looks different for us,” he tells Rolling Stone. For those in his area, their connection with the brand came from discount stores like Ross and Marshalls. “We were discriminated against in the early 2000s going to clubs, Ralph Lauren was the clothes we were wearing to get in.”

	The relationship that Black Americans have to the Ralph Lauren's brand depends where you live and how much money you have. Brooklyn's Lo Life crew, for example, was known for shoplifting Ralph Lauren in the Eighties as a means of protest. “Growing up in the ghetto,” Rack-Lo, its founder, once said, ”the clothing inspired us that there was more to life. It inspired us to be a part of the rich and elite and acquire the American Dream.” Those who purchased their Ralph Lauren by way of its official store, on the other hand, felt the new campaign was a positive representation of their lives,  where struggle and adversity weren't at the center. “I feel like this side of the Black experience doesn't get enough attention,” says Carlysle McNaught, who counteracted Cobb's take on Ralph Lauren via TikTok. “[The media] just further builds into these negative stereotypes.” 

	











	It's true that Jeter's Oak Bluffs campaign highlights an often overlooked story of Black affluent life, also recently seen in The Gilded Age, which depicts elite Black communities in the Northeast in the 19th Century as railroad construction took off. A century and a half later, now in a tech-era, Black folks are still coming to terms with what “elite” means to them. “The Black elite is about self definition,” says Carla Peterson, author of Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City. Her family was an inspiration behind the family of The Gilded Age's upper-crust Black lead, Peggy Scott. “The Black elite is the old elite my parents were a part of. There's gatekeeping and policing of borders which we see in Felicia Rashad's character [Elizabeth Kirkland]. That was about respectability and good character and pedigree, high culture and social belonging. It creates a society that brings pleasure but the exclusion can be hurtful.” 


	When Jeter publicly presented the Ralph Lauren campaign on Martha's Vineyard, he and panelists engaged in a discussion, describing the campaign as “elite,” but not “elitist.” David Rice, a Morehouse psychology professor and advisor to the brand, posed a question: “What does it mean to be elitist and separate ourselves from others? That's something for us to pay attention to as we are in these privileged spaces, what are our responsibilities?” Speaking with Rolling Stone, he explains that the discourse was part of the point. “I don't represent Ralph Lauren, but I don't see them as needing to be responsible or responsive to the critique,” Rice says. “This narrative and discourse is about looking at Oak Bluffs, this very privileged space, through the eyes of two historically Black colleges and that's a perspective. In many instances, there's legitimate critique and it was anticipated. The idea was to spark conversation.”  


	In recent years, Black wealth has increased, but studies show that only 4.7 percent out of 13.6 percent of Black folks maintain it. “The way I view elitism isn't excluding people but opening the door for people of color,” says Christy Batantou. “We live in a capitalistic society and with this collection, people feel left out and that this life isn't attainable but I see it as inspiring.” Yet, despite the wealth misdistributions, Black consumer power is expanding. “My critique is not on the Ralph Lauren brand but on understanding our relationship to capitalism and consumerism,” says Dr. Taylor Cummings, an educational psychologist. “The way that Black folks have historically conceptualized luxury is deeply tied to whiteness and systems of power and domination. You can't be free in a system of capitalism.”

	My visit to Oak Bluffs is friendly. Everyone smiles with familiarity despite us being strangers. I run into a former classmate from my HBCU alma mater, North Carolina A&T and see Black celebrities like Greenleaf's Keith David taking a seat at Nancy's Restaurant. Tabitha Brown's daughter, Choyce, is walking freely down Lake Ave., and Michelle Obama is hosting an event days later. It is a different kind of safety, one that's I've rarely felt since my years at A&T. However, elitism rears its head. In conversations, people make the case for Oak Bluffs and the campaign, thankful it shows “Black excellence,” and not “ghetto behavior.” One woman vacationing tells me that the area “is good for white folks, because the media presentation of us is so ratchet, raggedy, and singular in entertainment.” 


	There's pride in Black spaces and the safety and success they bring. Our stories are varied and vast and a deep dive into one does not discredit the other. Yet the work to distance oneself from our societal struggle, to show success, still indicates struggle. Black culture has always made lemonade from its lemons. But what else is there to do when that's your only ingredient? “Two things can be true,” says Cobb. “You can be autonomous [and] move in community. Black people are not a monolith but our liberation has to be monolithic in order for us all to be free.”

	Leave it to Spike Lee to explode the typical high-stakes remake. His new film, Highest 2 Lowest, which opened Friday, flips Akira Kurosawa's mannered 1963 staple, High and Low, into a rowdy, topical, laugh-out-loud romp (starring Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, and A$AP Rocky) that's as beautifully jarring as a dissonant sax solo. On a recent call from New York, Lee invokes the analogy himself: “Denzel and I in this film — we're jazz musicians. We respect Julie Andrews singing ‘My Favorite Things.' But when John Coltrane did it, you know, or when Miles did his standard of ‘My Funny Valentine,' it's a different thing. And that's why I call this a reinterpretation and not a remake.”


	Lee, of course, has been repositioning our world — always to provocative effect — for close to four decades. Since his hit 1986 indie She's Gotta Have it, his offbeat humor and peripatetic lens have imbued his characters with a salient, mock-heroic grace, foregrounding open notions of Black identity which feel eminently relatable. Still, he rejects the idea that he's a visionary. “Look, people gonna say what they want, but for me, my choice would be storyteller,” he says.Those stories are incredible. More than any other director of his ilk, Lee has persistently brought arthouse sensibilities to the mainstream. His most arresting movies are about everyday folks living out their lives in a Chekovian, destiny-in-lowercase dynamic. There's a painterly aspect to each of his films, where quiet transcendence aligns with larger-than-life chutzpah. 

	











Highest 2 Lowest continues that friction, giving viewers both a cinephilic treasure trove and a sympathetic Bronx hero in Washington's David King, a music mogul whose status and wealth make him and his brood the prey of an obsessive kidnapper. Rolling Stone spoke with Lee about his interpretation of this story, working with Denzel and A$AP, meeting Kurosawa, and more.

	











What do you think your artistic vision brings out in such a big star like Denzel?I don't have . . . That's him. That's D. You know, here's the thing, though. He's the star. He's Jordan and I'm Pippen. [Laughs.] But it's a team. You know, this is our fifth joint together, in order: Mo Better Blues, Malcolm X, He Got Game, Inside Man, which was done — it didn't feel like it was 18 years ago. Denzel said the same thing. But there was . . . we didn't have to relearn. I mean, it was like it was yesterday. So, I'm just happy that we got to do it again.


The classic idea of the leading man seems almost opposed to your work. Do you agree with that?I don't think that. I know what you're trying to say, because I've been very successful with the ensemble pieces. . . . But the five films I've done with Denzel have been very successful, too. So, I go with the flow, you know? And, you know, that just can't be booty [laughs] with Denzel in one of my joints. So, you gotta do what you gotta do.

You took on a giant this time, updating Akira Kurosawa's High and Low. Why did you choose to reinterpret this film?One of the reasons I love this Kurosawa joint is that it deals with morality. What will people do when they're put in certain situations? You gotta remember, a writer named Ed McBain [a pen name for Evan Hunter, born Salvatore Lombini] wrote it [the novel King's Ransom, on which High and Low was based]. So this was an American novel first, then Kurosawa adapted it into a film. I really wanted to get out there that this is not a remake. It's more than that. At the same time, respecting the source, the book, and the film. Kurosawa is one of the giants of cinema and one of my favorite filmmakers — and I got to meet him too! You know, I'm a collector, and one of the things I treasure the most is a beautiful portrait of Akira Kurosawa, which he signed for me. And he signed his autographs with the paintbrush of white ink. So I looked at that thing many times while I was shooting this film. [Laughs.] One of the great filmmakers of all time. 


	The film I first saw in film school, NYU graduate film school, which is where I first got to see world cinema, was Rashomon. It's a film where there's a murder and a rape and, he, Kurosawa, leads the audience to believe who's telling the truth. I used that premise for my first film, She's Gotta Have It. We have Nola Darling, and she has three boyfriends, and the three boyfriends talk about, you know, who this woman is. And she's talking about these three boyfriends she has at the same time.

Do you think that there's more pressure on you to portray what's dignified and regal about the Black experience, and sell that to the larger culture?No, I don't put that type of pressure on me. And Black folks are not one monolithic group. We don't all do everything and think alike. So I've never — or tried not to get mad. You know, when I get heat from my sisters and brothers . . . My sisters and brothers in Chicago, they did not like [Lee's Chicago-set 2015 film] Chi-Raq [laughs].

	











Really?Well, you don't live in Chicago. No, they did not like that film at all.


Wow. It makes sense that you would say that you're not specifically doing anything for Black folks as a monolith. ‘Cause I think that idea in and of itself would be in opposition to what you've always represented. It's always been a broader, wider—We are so diverse and so many things. So, for me to say, I'm just doing one thing; there's only one version of Black people, I mean, that's just . . . I don't think that's intelligent.


Do you think that you're more Jackie Robinson or Satchel Page?You know, that's a crazy question you asked me. I say that because my daughter's name is Satchel. And my mother's name is Jackie, Jacqueline, so . . . [laughs]  . . . But I think there's a lot to what you name your child. You know? And we Black folks, and I say this with much respect, we be making up names! [Laughs.]


Takisha, Shaquanda . . .Oh, I swear to God! We be making up names! [Laughs.] I mean, that's who we are. That's who we are. We're gonna do that . . . I mean, look . . . we're creative! 


There's an epic scene in Highest 2 Lowest where a subway chase occurs at the same time as a Puerto Rican Day Parade party.That's my homage to the director Billy Friedkin and his film The French Connection starring Gene Hackman. That film?… Whoo! Saw that in high school! And it's funny, the great sequence where he's chasing the subway, the L train, where that chasing starts was the subway stop [by] my high school. So it was shot while I was in high school, but I was in class, so no one knew it was being shot while we were in class. And I hope people go back and check out The French Connection. Great, great movie. Please watch The French Connection again. Promise me that. All right?I promise you, I'll watch it. What's your funniest or most interesting memory of A$AP Rocky's interactions with Denzel on set?For years, people, not just me, said that Rocky could be Denzel's son. For years, people were saying that. And I asked Rocky about it. He said, “Yeah, it's my” — his big ears. So to get the honor and the pleasure of having these two guys go after each other in the scene — generational. And here's the thing though: Rocky is not masquerading as an actor. He is an actor. And he came with his game, because he knew he had to. He just couldn't . . . this is Denzel here. So his thing was like, “I got testicles too!” [Laughs.] And that just heightened, to me, the drama between the two in the movie and where their characters are. A generational beef, in addition to all the other stuff that's going on in the film.


Yeah, Rocky definitely bodied that role, just brought a lot of energy to it.It was authentic, wasn't it?


Authentic as hell. I mean, Rocky's from Harlem, uptown! [Laughs.]. And Denzel is such a presence that people start getting weak in the knees if they have to go directly against him. That's how powerful Denzel is. And if you don't bring it, you just gonna be overpowered. But Rocky's like, “Fuck that.” [Laughs.] You know, sports: The best games are when they're highly, highly contested. There's no game when a team is blowing out the other team. There's no drama there! Right or wrong?

	











You ‘re right. Just like this last season with the Knicks.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You want one more question? 


Fair enough.So you enjoyed the film, though, right?

	Conan O'Brien said that late-night shows will eventually “disappear” from television amid the “seismic change” in the industry, but that hosts like Stephen Colbert — whose Late Show run will end next year — are “too talented and too essential to go away.”


	Speaking at the Television Academy Hall of Fame on Saturday, O'Brien — a veteran of Late Night, Conan, and (briefly) The Tonight Show — said that, “Yes, late-night television, as we have known it since around 1950, is going to disappear. But those voices are not going anywhere.”


	“There's a lot of fear about the future of television, and rightfully so. The life we've all known for almost 80 years is undergoing seismic change,” O'Brien said (via Variety).


	However, O'Brien, who successfully pivoted to streaming and podcasting after his late-night run ended, added that those platforms are how younger generations are now ingesting comedy, as traditional television and its constraints are “a high-protein, chewable, vanilla-flavored capsule with added fiber.”

	“People like Stephen Colbert are too talented and too essential to go away,” O'Brien said. “Stephen is going to evolve and shine brighter than ever in a new format that he controls completely. So, technology can do whatever they want.”


	O'Brien added of an evolving landscape devoid of traditional late-night TV, “I choose not to mourn what is lost, because I think in the most essential way, what we have is not changing at all.”

	Ronnie Rondell Jr., the longtime Hollywood stuntman immortalized on fire for the cover of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, has died at the age of 88.


	Rondell Jr. died Tuesday at a senior living facility in Missouri, his family announced (via The Hollywood Reporter). No cause of death was provided.


	A stuntman and actor with over 200 credits on his filmography, Rondell Jr. is perhaps best known for a single photograph: The iconic cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here, where he was lit on fire on a Hollywood backlot (Warner Bros. Studios), shaking hands with a man in a suit (Danny Rogers).


	“I'd been doing a lot of fire work in those days, and I had the special suits and all this stuff for fully enveloped fire,” Rondell Jr. said in the documentary Pink Floyd: The Story of Wish You Were Here. “It was pretty easy to do, not too life-threatening, and paid well.”


	To capture the photo, conceived by Hipgnosis' Storm Thorgesen and Audrey Powell, Rondell Jr. was reportedly lit on fire 15 times, as wind and other factors — “There's a funny thing about fire. When it gets in your face, you're going to move,” Rondell Jr. added — forced the many attempts.

	











	During the shoot, the flames caused Rondell Jr. to lose an eyebrow and part of his mustache, but the finished product was worth it: Wish You Were Here is routinely hailed as one of the greatest album covers of all time.

	“Ronnie was very gracious about it considering… but as far as he was concerned as a professional in the movie industry it was all in a day's work,” Powell said of Rondell Jr.s contribution.

	











	In a big screen and small screen career that spanned from 1955 to 2003, Rondell Jr. appeared significantly-albeit-anonymously or served as a stunt coordinator in films and shows like Lethal Weapon, Batman & Robin, Twister, The Crow, Predator 2, They Live, The Karate Kid, Commando, and TV's Charlie's Angels. While he retired in 2000, he returned for one final film, a chase sequence in 2003's The Matrix Reloaded, where his son R.A. Rondell served as supervising stunt coordinator.

	Almost three months before Zohran Mamdani's earthquake of a victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary this summer, a substitute teacher and long-time union organizer named Alex Brower shocked Milwaukee City Hall by winning a special election for city council as a Democratic Socialist. Brower ran on highly specific local issues — namely, lowering utility bills by challenging the We Energies company in Milwaukee. Attending the biennial Democratic Socialists of America convention in Chicago last weekend, Brower, wearing a brown T-shirt with the words “SOCIALIST PARTY” scrawled in big, unmissable letters, struggled to stop talking about local policymaking when we spoke in one the few quiet corners of the convention center. 


	Every two years, delegates from each chapter of the organization gather to debate and vote on resolutions on DSA's priorities and elect a National Political Committee (NPC) to lead them. Brower, a Milwaukee-DSA delegate, laughed off the notion that traditional Democrats can replicate Mamdani's success — or his own — via savvy social media alone, rather than running on affordability and redistributive policies. “People are very angry with the system right now,” Brower says. “At DSA, we're leading by saying, ‘OK, here's a material problem. Here's how DSA proposes to fix it.'”

	











	This year's convention comes at a watershed moment for DSA, two months after Mamdani's victory sent shockwaves across the political establishment — and precisely 10 years after Bernie Sanders did the same when he announced his presidential bid in June 2015, galvanizing a new generation of American leftists. Today, Mamdani can hardly record a man-on-the-street video without being interrupted by fans lining up for photos, while the rest of the Democratic Party holds its lowest approval rating in over 30 years and has been unable to cut through the noise (a livestream from Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in June at one point failed to crack 80 viewers).

	The stakes couldn't be higher for DSA to take advantage of the current political moment. President Donald Trump has wasted no time reshaping the country around corporate interests, signing a sweeping budget bill that threatens to force at least 17 million people off their health insurance while allocating over $170 billion to ICE and border enforcement. The midterms are on the horizon, and regaining control of Congress could be Democrats' best — perhaps even their last — chance at reining in this unabashedly authoritarian administration. 


	With the momentum of Mamdani's victory, the existential threat of the second Trump era, and lingering reminders of where the organization fell short 10 years ago under Sanders' banner, there was a lot to discuss at the convention last weekend. Among the nearly 2,000 DSA delegates and leaders who convened, many arrived — and left — with disagreements about how best to seize the moment. 


	But every DSA member I spoke to easily agreed on one thing: It's their moment to seize.


	Numerous delegates identified Brower's race as an example of what they want to see from the organization nationwide: a pipeline of Democratic Socialists in local government, a bench of candidates who can eventually, successfully run for mayor — or higher. In 2017, 15 DSA members were elected to state or local office, bringing the organization's total number of elected officials to 35. In 2025, over 250 DSA members hold elected office — 90 percent were elected after 2019, following Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset victory the year before. As of this year, a third of Portland, Oregon's city council consists of DSA members.


	Like so many other members, Brower got involved with DSA a decade ago when Sanders entered the national scene. He tells me he knew he'd run for office someday the night Ocasio-Cortez won her primary. Brower may have “some disagreements” with other DSA members or electeds under the DSA banner, but “leaders like AOC, Rashida Tlaib, Cori Bush, Jamaal Bowman, Bernie, who have identified as Democratic Socialists in Congress, are an inspiration to all kinds of people to run for office.” They're the reason he and so many of the people gathered in Chicago — with their colorful array of keffiyahs and canvas tote bags, their comfortable shoes and curiously styled mustaches — were there at all.

	But there's a broad range of opinions about some of the Democratic Socialists who Brower name-dropped as role models, and the extent to which the organization should open its tent to as many elected officials and members as possible — or whether it should instead sharpen and potentially narrow its standards for membership. 

	











	Kristian Hernandez, who formerly served on the NPC for four years and organizes in North Texas, says the sometimes highly public, highly messy disagreements within her organization don't alarm her: “It's like with my family,” she explains. “We're very, very passionate, we have a lot of political arguments.” Hernandez joined DSA in 2016, organizing for immigrant rights and eventually becoming a delegate for Sanders' presidential campaign. She was the one to convince large swaths of her initially pro-Hillary Clinton family to vote for Sanders. 


	Navigating political disagreements — within either a large family or an organization attempting to build political power across the nation — can be messy: Last summer, NYC-DSA voted to endorse Ocasio-Cortez in her reelection bid. The national DSA, meanwhile, rescinded its endorsement, questioning the congresswoman's “commitment to the movement for Palestine and our collective socialist project.” Some DSA members regarded Ocasio-Cortez's support for Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris that year as implicit support for the Biden-Harris administration's outsized role in funding and arming Israel's war on Gaza. Other DSA members see Ocasio-Cortez as a reliable ally and partner in governing, and one of a small number of Congress members who publicly call Israel's war on Gaza a genocide.


	At least one proposed resolution at the convention aimed to censure Ocasio-Cortez over certain votes and comments on Israel and Palestine. Last month, Ocasio-Cortez appeared to defend U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome as “defensive” military aid to protect civilians. But critics argue that distinguishing between “defensive” and “offensive” military aid is meaningless, because funding the Iron Dome gives Israel the capacity to carry out its brutal occupation and war on Palestine without repercussions. Nonetheless, that resolution was placed distinctly low on the convention's deliberation agenda, ensuring no time for delegates to debate or vote on it, and leaving it — along with the rest of the remaining resolutions — to be decided by the NPC. 


	“We have this phrase in DSA,” Hernandez says, “that we're somewhat building the plane as we're flying it. There will be messiness and contradictions.”


	Leftists aren't exactly known for civility in disagreement, though — especially online. 


	DSA's internal culture is frequently the object of online jokes about, say, its quirky singles mixers, or its members addressing each other as “comrade” in the year 2025. And a decade since Sanders' rise also marks a decade since the hotly debated caricature of the white, male “Bernie Bro” as a stand-in for the average DSA member and leftist. In the liberal imagination, the “Bernie Bro” is insensitive toward “social issues” and “identity politics,” blurring these in favor of a materialist, populist economic lens. Of course, many women and marginalized people vocally supported Sanders. And universal health care is more tangibly beneficial to most women's everyday lives than electing a woman who opposes universal health care. Still, the caricature endured. 

	











	Megan Romer, who at the convention was elected to her second term as NPC co-chair after receiving the most first-place votes of any candidate, acknowledges about 70 percent of DSA's membership is male. But since June, DSA has highlighted the strikingly diverse coalition of voters who backed Mamdani — East and South Asian, Latine, Black, Arab, and Jewish communities and young voters decisively mobilized for him, where Sanders' presidential campaigns struggled with some of these demographics. 


	“There are some bro-y dudes around, because there are bro-y dudes around in society, and they also need affordable health care, affordable college,” Genevieve Rand, co-chair of DSA's Trans Rights and Bodily Autonomy Committee and a trans woman, tells me. “But the slander that that's the only people who are here has been the opposite of my experience.”


	On the second day of the convention, I met leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker shortly before his stream that afternoon. Piker attended the convention as a “DSA booster.” We talked for well over an hour about the organization and leftist politics and culture in this political moment. I asked him about the now-10-year-old concept of the “Bernie Bro.”


	“I'm the original Bernie Bro,” he jokes. Piker is one of few popular media figures who espouse progressive politics to a massive young male fan base. 


	“There are definitely white people in DSA and white people do sometimes have blind spots. But people like to hyper-focus on these sorts of things, because as a leftist, as a socialist, the expectations are significantly higher,” Piker says. He points to the dynamics between Democrats and Republicans and the massive gulf between what constitutes “cancelable” offenses on both sides: “The Democrat is expected to operate in a certain way, as opposed to how Republicans can do whatever the fuck they want. A similar dynamic exists between the left and Democrats, where, as a leftist or socialist, you're expected to behave in certain ways, where things that otherwise wouldn't be considered problematic can all of a sudden be used against you.” One example: “I got canceled for buying a house,” he says, referring to criticism over the Los Angeles home he shares with his family.


	Despite popular portrayals of DSA members as unpleasant “Bernie Bros” who despise each other, many delegates I spoke to say they joined DSA for radical politics, but stayed for community. Among demographics like young men, companionship seems increasingly crucial to staving off right-wing radicalization from the online manosphere. “Solidarity has a similar feeling to the expression of love. It sounds kind of corny, but I feel much less lonely when I'm at a protest or alongside people in political movements,” Piker says. “If you don't have any sort of love for other people around you, then you're not going to fight for or defend them.”

	











	But the methods of how best to fight for each other, how best to win for each other, are hotly contested across DSA. The American left has something of a reputation for struggling to organize internally, for being quick to cannibalize each other over what might seem like small disagreements. But some DSA leaders, like Colleen Johnston, an outgoing NPC member, think these narratives can be overblown: “I think there's interest in portraying us that way, as always fighting, because then they don't have to talk about all the ways we're building power, our policies, our effective campaigns across the country.”


	To Ashik Siddique, now serving his third term as co-chair of the NPC, “the important thing is we have strong discussions. DSA is a democracy, in a country where formal democracy is not very strong. In DSA, we vote on our positions, then move forward. Even when it feels messy, we get to a point where we have consensus.”


	“Messy” is one word to describe certain scenes amid three days of hours-long, nonstop debate about DSA's future. Rose decor — balloons, hats, flyers, art — was everywhere in the convention hall, sprawled across walls, on tables, alongside snack spreads that included everything from granola bars and water bottles to Altoids and Zyns. And roses, which feature prominently in DSA's logo, come with thorns; they're a package deal. 


	Early Friday, Tlaib walked onstage to a standing ovation and thunderous applause to deliver her keynote address. If DSA members hold mixed opinions about some Democratic Socialist politicians, their adoration for the first Palestinian-American member of Congress seemed universal. Much of Tlaib's speech condemned Israel's brutal campaign in Gaza and Congress' seemingly unconditional support for the war. She struggled to speak through tears as she questioned whether her own colleagues would be able to so easily “press the ‘yes' button” to send more weapons to Israel if they saw Palestinian children — Palestinian people — as human beings. 


	With each “free Palestine” she uttered, the room erupted in cheers so deafening you could barely hear her next words. Then came Tlaib's remarks that have since been clipped in numerous viral social media posts, appearing to reference her fellow-“Squad” member Ocasio-Cortez's Iron Dome comments: “I say this honestly with love: I don't care what you label or call it. A weapon is a weapon. You support the funding of genocide or you don't.” Tlaib's remarks electrified the convention hall as she railed against her “warmonger” colleagues, against imperialism and capitalism: “The violence against our people doesn't have to come in the form of a bomb or a gun. The systems and structures around us kill our neighbors. It's the same effect.” She urged DSA to “cultivate this people-power into a force that can fight fascism and win a united front in order to beat fascism.” 

	











	“This is our duty. This is our responsibility. This is our moment,” she said. “You don't need to tell me that the Democratic Party establishment has completely failed to present meaningful resistance to this billionaire class, to Trump and fascism.” Across the U.S., working-class people “know they have been let down. They're looking for a new home. They want to envision alternatives, and we have it.”


	Tlaib's remarks united the room. You would hardly guess that, within an hour, the same convention hall would become a site of intense, sometimes vitriolic arguments.


	Thanks in part to Mamdani, this year's convention came amid the most national attention the organization has had on it since Sanders' rise almost a decade ago. With that momentum, some factions of DSA want the organization to focus on external organizing, expansion, and growth, bringing in as many new people as possible. Other factions see this as a key moment for moral clarity, for setting clear internal standards of conduct and ensuring that members and electeds are unwavering against genocide and fascism. 


	Romer doesn't see internal and external organizing as mutually exclusive: “I see it as a ‘yes, and' rather than ‘either-or,'” she says. Queens DSA's Aaron Fernando agrees, but he questions some DSA leaders' priorities based on the convention agenda, including which resolutions were debated and voted on and which were buried. For instance, he hoped the convention would focus more on setting priorities for DSA's resistance to the new Trump administration, like strategizing on how to fight for trans people, rather than internal conflicts. “I think we went in the wrong direction this convention,” he says. “Instead of focusing on more outward-facing mass politics, we stagnated on personal beefs and factionalism within DSA. That sort of agenda is not good for a national organization.”


	Some resolutions were uncontroversial: On Saturday, delegates passed one for DSA to run a presidential candidate in 2028, likely under the Democratic Party ballot line, similar to Sanders in 2016 and 2020. An amendment to specify that the candidate would run under a third party failed. Rand told me she's particularly excited about this resolution: “What Bernie Sanders showed even though he didn't win is that a socialist can win the highest office in America,” she says.


	Other resolutions were more contentious. A resolution known as “1m1v,” or One Member One Vote, for instance, swallowed up a large chunk of deliberation on Friday afternoon. Under 1m1v, each dues-paying DSA member would get to vote on members of the NPC. Proponents argue it embodies direct democracy, mimicking labor unions and other international leftist parties, and allows rank-and-file members to both feel and be part of the national organization. Opponents worry about less active and less informed members potentially sabotaging the organization. 

	











	Floor debate over 1m1v devolved, at times, into enough of a mess to spark semi-viral social media outrage. One delegate who supported the resolution drew comparisons between those who opposed it and those who opposed Reconstruction and civil rights. These comments were met with a wave of boos, shocked gasps, and jeers. Some DSA members took to social media to complain about being compared to slaveowners for disagreeing with their “comrades.”


	The resolution decisively failed.


	The most heated debate surrounded the “For a Fighting Anti-Zionist DSA” resolution, which restates DSA's commitments to Palestinian liberation and against any material support for Israel — and establishes a red-line for members, candidates, and elected officials, opening the door for expulsion or required political education for those in violation. To some delegates, the resolution read as a proxy for resolutions to expel Ocasio-Cortez and Los Angeles City Council member Nithya Raman over statements or votes regarding Israel. These opponents argued the resolution is redundant given DSA's existing positions on Palestine, and that it's a vehicle to punish and expel members or electeds, including those who have since changed their positions. Supporters of the resolution deny that it would be applied retroactively or in bad-faith.


	The resolution decisively passed on Sunday afternoon to “Free Palestine” chants across the convention hall.


	Seemingly less controversial resolutions on the national organization's budget and stipends for its political leadership sparked less heated debate. But some delegates told me these resolutions emerged from simmering tensions between certain factions of DSA.


	In 2023, at the onset of Israel's war on Gaza and explosive political debates across the U.S., DSA carried out layoffs. Romer says that at the time, the organization was $1 million in debt. “That's the worst feeling you have as a socialist,” she says of the situation. But on the condition of anonymity, some delegates disputed this version of events, claiming the organization's finances were never that dire, that DSA's membership base is full of skilled fundraisers who could easily have raised the necessary funding to keep staffers employed, and that some members of DSA leadership actively want to divest from staffers to consolidate more organizational power for themselves. Some of these allegations have been made quite publicly, and the staff union filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board last January. Romer maintains that the 2023 layoffs were necessary due to budget constraints. 

	











	It's difficult if not impossible to break down the range of factions and tensions within DSA without getting too in the weeds. Fernando, who represents one of the organization's two major factions, sees DSA's goal as “bringing in as many people as possible” and winning elections everywhere, and regards Mamdani's coalition-building, grassroots field operations and victory as an inspiration. Romer, who aligns with DSA's other major faction, agrees on the importance of winning elections, but also stresses the importance of “agitation,” praising Mamdani's past activism in the form of hunger strikes for Palestine and in solidarity with taxi drivers as an inspiration. Mamdani — like Tlaib — is a unifying name across all caucuses.


	NYC-DSA co-chair Gustavo Gordillo, who joined DSA a decade ago around when Sanders first ran for president, has attended four DSA conventions. “Over time, I've seen disagreement handled better, with far less personal, healthier conversations,” he says. “When we first started having these bigger disagreements after the Bernie surge, when so many people with sometimes very different politics joined, disagreements were treated much more personally. Now, I think we've matured as an organization, where we don't let disagreements destabilize us.”


	When Mamdani first launched his mayoral campaign at the end of October, he was a state Assembly member with minimal name recognition. By June, posters of his face were plastered across the city; you couldn't walk a block without seeing his smile in the window of nearly every coffee shop, bodega, halal cart, or apartment. Much as some Democratic strategists would like to attribute his surge in popularity solely to charisma and engaging social media, just as well known as his name are the tenets of his platform: free buses, freezing the rent, and universal child care. And what his opponents repeatedly tried to nail him with as a liability — his unwavering support for Palestine and strong criticisms of Israel — has instead proven a strength. 


	Almost a decade ago, Quinnipiac University polling showed Democratic voters sympathized with Israelis more than Palestinians by a 13-point margin; new polling from July reveals a 56-point swing, with Democrats now sympathizing more with Palestinians by a net 43 points. CNN polling expert Harry Enten called this a “sea change,” the scale of which he “rarely” sees in politics. In January, polling showed among the nearly 20 million people who voted for Biden in 2020 but didn't vote in 2024, a third cited Harris' sustained support for Israel.

	











	“Voters like to see anyone standing their ground on Palestine. I think that's increased a lot of people's confidence [that] Zohran is actually going to deliver on his platform — they thought, ‘Oh, you can't really deliver,'” Siddique said. “But because he stood his ground on Palestine, or people see him challenging ICE very directly — people trust fighters.”


	DSA leaders, who have long held support for Palestine as the moral position, are navigating a new paradigm in which support for Palestine is also the politically smart one. We're rapidly approaching the 2026 midterms, and as mainstream Democrats resist their own base by unconditionally, materially backing Israel, DSA members believe they can fill this vacuum in leadership.


	Olivia Katbi, co-chair of Portland-DSA, says her chapter's organizing has focused largely on Palestine and overseeing successful local boycott, divest, and sanctions (BDS) campaigns against Israel in recent years. “The Democratic Party is a capitalist, racist, pro-genocide party, and DSA is offering an actual alternative to that,” she says. Batul Hassan, an NYC-DSA steering committee member whose organizing has focused on pro-Palestine initiatives, echoed Katbi: “A lot of the member growth that we've had, the mass turnout for Zohran, who is very morally consistent on his position on Palestine, is because of that — because we're member-driven, not beholden to pro-genocide billionaires.”


	DSA members are determined to ensure Mamdani's victory on these principles, on an unrepentantly socialist and pro-Palestine platform, wasn't just a flash in the pan. In November, NYC-DSA member Claire Valdez won her seat in the state Assembly after crushing the Democratic incumbent Juan Ardila by 48 points in the primary. “Right now, the Democratic establishment is unwilling or incapable of meeting the moment, fighting Trump's fascist administration, the genocide and famine in Gaza — there's a vast gulf between what the Democratic base wants and how we're being represented,” Valdez tells me. She believes Democratic Socialists are poised to make waves in 2026: “People are hungry for an alternative. You saw that with my campaign, you saw that with Zohran's.”


	In addition to Valdez, and Brower in Milwaukee, candidates like Atlanta city council candidate Kelsea Bond and Jersey City council candidate Jake Ephros also attended the convention. Ephros says he “wouldn't be running without my local DSA chapter,” with which he organized for over five years before running for office this year.

	











	NYC-DSA co-chairs Grace Mausser and Gordillo, alongside Siddique, hosted a workshop on strategies to run and win on a campaign like Mamdani's on the convention's final day. Mausser emphasized the importance of partnership and patience when working with candidates: “We knew when we endorsed Zohran there were going to be tensions and contradictions in electing a socialist mayor,” she says. “But we can't let those tensions hold us back from taking power. The left has done that for far too long.” With Mamdani, Mausser says NYC-DSA is “building a new model of partnership,” navigating disagreements “while still prioritizing collaboration and a fruitful governing relationship.”


	Today, “everyone in New York City knows who Zohran is — a socialist — because he identifies as a socialist, and it wasn't a liability but a strength for him,” Gordillo said. Across all chapters, every DSA member and leader I spoke to said some version of the same thing: They believe, today, socialism is popular, socialism can win, and socialism can thrive in all the spaces where the Democratic Party is stagnating. As Hernandez puts it: “It's not just about saying Democrats are bad, but also giving people something positive to vote for.”

	Gordillo says the chapter's membership has almost doubled since Mamdani's victory, which positions him to be the highest-ranking socialist in office in U.S. history. Delegates from chapters across the country say they've seen surges in interest, too. “Zohran showed that a mass coalition can be led by a socialist. We saw him bring along supporters who are more moderate or considered liberals, to build a large tent that was actually led by a working-class, socialist agenda,” Gordillo says. “Biden was not able to do that. Kamala Harris also failed — that's because they were constantly trying to compromise with the billionaire class.” He believes Mamdani models the way forward.


	“I think we need to let a million Zohrans bloom, and there's Zohrans everywhere for those with eyes that see,” Piker says. “There have been far worse circumstances where people have been able to successfully organize and make changes that have improved humanity. I think that's what can happen right now.”

The strange white light appeared above the sky in upstate New York on the evening of Aug. 12

Moment RF/Getty

 Residents of upstate New York were recently met with an unusual sight — a bright white light in the night sky with a strange-looking aura.


 The mysterious light appeared the evening of Tuesday, Aug. 12, per local news outlet the Times Union. 


 A number of area residents posted about the sighting on social media, with several speculating it might be a UFO, according to the New York Post.


 However, it turns out that the source of the light had a much more earthly explanation: Local residents were observing the tail and plume of the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which was launched on Aug. 12 from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at around 9 p.m. local time, per Space.com. 


 The rocket carried an experimental navigation satellite and was launched by the United Launch Alliance (ULA) on behalf of the U.S. military, per the outlet. It launched with four side-mounted rocket boosters in order to send the satellite directly into geosynchronous orbit.

 Additionally, it was the U.S. military's first experimental navigation satellite to be launched in 48 years, per Space.com. The spacecraft is designed to provide data similar to that of a GPS system and will test a variety of new technologies.

 This was the Vulcan's third successful flight. The 202-foot rocket took flight in January 2024 and again in October of the same year. 


 The most recent launch marked one of ULA's longest flights ever, at seven hours and 22,000 miles, according to the ULA blog.


 Upstate New York residents were looking up at the sky for good reason the night of the launch: It coincided with the peak night of the Perseids meteor shower, which lights up the sky each summer.

 The Perseids are especially famous for their brilliant fireballs. These exceptionally bright meteors burst with intense light and often linger longer than a typical shooting star. 


 NASA considers it “the best meteor shower of the year,” producing “swift, bright meteors that frequently leave long wakes of light and color.”

Adrian Lee talks to ghosts for a living.

Lee is the son of two scientists. He holds a degree in graphic design from the Kent Institute of Art and Design at Kent University, a post graduate certificate of education from Goldsmiths, at the University of London, as well as a master's degree and a doctorate in art history from Open University. He's published 15 books and is working on a TV show that he hopes to get picked up.

Oh, and he's also met Johnny Cash. Well, sort of.

See, Lee's not your average historian. His investigations begin with the last source most people would think to question: the dead.

""As a historian, you only work with secondary source material,"" Lee said. ""With all that information, you have an educated guess as to what took place in the era (as) we weren't actually there. It was remarkable for me as a historian to realize that you could have a conversation with someone that died 150 years ago and you can ask them what it was like.""

Lee spoke to a sold out crowd on Saturday night at the Iowa State Fair in an event titled ""Ghost Hunting 101: How to be a Paranormal Investigator.""

Though he has conducted paranormal investigations around the world, most of Lee's recent work has been focused in and around the Midwest, with many episodes of his show ""Unscripted Paranormal"" shot in Iowa.

The State Fair was the pefect place for a hunt, Lee said, as fairgrounds tend to retain lots of spiritual energy.

During the his presentation, Lee walked attendees through the do's and don'ts of ghost hunting. Certain attire is strictly prohibited, according to Lee's rule book. Patterned clothing could be picked up by specialized cameras and cause a false positive. Light from flash photography can bounce off of jewelry, resulting in the same outcome. 

Lee and his team, who included Heather Morris, Steve Thaemert and Scott Kenner, explained how their equipment worked. They talked the crowd through the technology behind electromagnetic field readers, spirit boxes — also known as electronic voice phenomena devices — and structured light sensor cameras. Many of the devices are made or modified by the team, themselves. The older and less fancy the equipment, the better, said Lee, especially when it comes to EVP devices. 

Newer voice recorders come with settings installed that function to filter out the background noise. This is counterintuitive toward the ghost hunting trade, Lee told the crowd, because oftentimes the evidence they're looking for can only be found in the snaps, crackles and pops of the static.

A key part of paranormal investigations is patience, according to Lee.

""If you put yourself in the right place at the right time, law of averages, you'll start to see (ghosts,)"", Lee said. ""But during a person's everyday life, I mean, very rarely have I seen a ghost outside of my investigating...I think an average person's life wouldn't take them to where a ghost would perhaps exist.""

Lee also professed psychic ability to the crowd gathered in Pioneer Hall, saying much of his communication with the spirit realm comes in the form of mental images, which he then transcribes. 

Lee said this psychic ability allows him to feel a physical empathy for the spirits with whom he speaks. 

“If your grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis, I'll feel my fingers start to get stiff,” Lee said. “Or if the person I'm talking to was hanged, I can feel a tighteness around my throat. Everyone has different things, but being psychic for me is almost like daydreaming.”

Lee said all of his books are all backed by historical research, though he added, most of the time his first clue as to what to look for comes from interactions with the dead.

As the event drew to a close, attendees walked out into the gathering darkness, sure to have a shiver or two running down their spine as they wove their way back out onto the fairgrounds.

A strange object hurdling through our solar system from interstellar space may, according to one of academia's most controversial astronomers, have been sent by aliens to see how smart we are.

The newly-discovered object, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, is only the third interstellar object of its kind to have been observed visiting our solar system. While most astronomers, including those at NASA, believe it to be a comet, Harvard's resident alien-hunter Avi Loeb has repeatedly suggested that it was sent to us by an extraterrestrial civilization — and may even function as something of a ""Turing Test"" for humanity.

In a new blog post, Loeb — who has become infamous in scientific circles for suggesting 'Oumuamua, the first interstellar object ever detected back in 2017, was an alien spacecraft — laid out his latest theory about 3I/ATLAS.

""It is well known to any interstellar traveler that there are plenty of icy rocks in planetary systems,"" Loeb wrote. ""These constitute the leftover building blocks from the construction process of the planets.""

""For that reason, an alien might assume that any intelligent observer on Earth must be familiar with space rocks as they impact the Earth on a regular basis,"" he continued, before advising: ""Not so fast.""

Though his case for 3I/ATLAS being a Turing Test sent by alien intelligence is pretty far-fetched, his insistence that his fellow scientists lack even human smarts is well-argued.

Citing ""terrestrial comet expert"" Chris Lintott of Oxford, who insisted last month that Loeb's alien-origin theory is ""nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object,"" the Harvard alien hunter suggested that any extraterrestrial being who encountered such dismissals could ""justifiably conclude that humans failed the test and do not deserve a high status in the class of intelligent civilizations within the Milky-Way galaxy.""

Ouch.

As the Harvard astronomer has contended, the scientific establishment at large may have gotten it wrong by immediately declaring 3I/ATLAS to be a comet. He pointed out new Hubble Space Telescope images of the object to back up his claim, which show a ""glow"" ahead of it, but ""no prominent cometary tail behind it, as is the case for common comets.""

Loeb also pointed out that spectroscopic measurements do not indicate that there's any ""molecular or atomic gas accompanying the glow around 3I/ATLAS,"" further undermining the theory that it's a comet.

To Loeb, there is one predominant alternative explanation about the origins of 3I/ATLAS if it's not a comet: that it's ""a technological object which targets the inner solar system,"" and even perfectly times its ""arrival time"" for ""a close encounter with Mars, Venus and Jupiter.""

Obviously, in a Universe as vast and unknowable as our own, there are other, non-alien explanations for all those anomalous properties seen in 3I/ATLAS.

To test his alien-origin theory out, Loeb has another, even more provocative proposal: sending a Morse code message to 3I/ATLAS, and seeing if anything (or anyone) responds. When speaking to reporters, the astronomer said that his ideal communiqué would be ""Hello, welcome to our neighborhood. Peace!""

As easy as it may be to dismiss Loeb's constant stream of strange alien claims, he does offer a fascinating alternate look at space rocks, and his notion that ""3I/ATLAS is a blind date of interstellar proportions"" is indeed pretty romantic to consider.

""As an optimist, I prefer to approach it with a positive mindset,"" Loeb wrote of the interstellar object. ""How we follow the initial greeting with alien intelligence would depend on the data we gather.""

Posted in: Exclusive, Horror, Interview, Movies | Tagged: The Avenue, Witchboard

Madison Iseman (Knights of the Zodiac) spoke to Bleeding Cool about her supernatural horror journey in The Avenue's Witchboard.



Madison Iseman is as versatile as they come in Hollywood, accomplishing so much in her career that spans over a decade since her on-screen debut in 2013's Second Chances. She's done her share of comedy, horror, action, and drama with memorable roles on ABC's Modern Family, Nickelodeon's Henry Danger, CMT's Still the King, Columbia/Sony's Jumanji franchise, New Line's Annabelle Comes Home (2019), Prime Video's TV adaptation of I Know What You Did Last Summer, and FX's American Horror Stories. Iseman's latest is the remake of the Kevin Tenney horror classic Witchboard. Set in present-day New Orleans, a cursed artifact unleashes a vengeful witch, drawing a young couple into a deadly spiral of possession, temptation, and occult terror. Dominguez spoke to Bleeding Cool about working with horror legend writer-director Chuck Russell, giving Emily the depth required of her character, the over-the-top practical effects sequences, and working with co-stars Aaron Dominguez and Jamie Campbell Bower.

What intrigued you about 'Witchboard?'

What originally drew me to it so much was Chuck, who's been around forever. He's so incredible and such a legend. 'Dream Warriors' (1987) was one of my favorite films when growing up. The opportunity to jump in with him was probably the number one thing that drew me to this. We had early conversations about what he wanted. The script was this fantastical take on this original IP, and it was fun from start to finish. He had all these incredible ideas, and it was something that I wanted to dive into. It was unlike anything that I had done before.

What was it about Chuck's script that stood out to you?

First, when my agent called me originally, they were like, ""You're going to like the script."" There are cats all over the whole thing, which I'm a huge cat lady. I was jumping at the opportunity to work with cats, but other than that, it was a fun acting challenge. Emily's a recovering addict. When you meet her, she starts a new restaurant with her fiancé. She's grounded, curious, and starts to get her life back together, and then she goes through this wave of emotions as she finds this board and gets enthralled with it, possessed by it, and without giving anything away, then somehow becomes a bit of a different person. So, reading it from the perspective of an actor, there was a lot to jump into that made me excited, and a lot of elements that I haven't gotten to do yet in my career.

I was wondering about that bed sequence with the multiple hands coming from below. How do you prep yourself to deal with that and go through the motions?

When I talked to Chuck early on, I brought up a lot of these scenes written on the page that were a bit larger than life, and one of my questions was, ""How are we planning on tackling half of these things?"" What makes Chuck so great is the practical effects, and he had all these crazy ideas about how we were going to get through them. The Hands was a big one because, written on page, it reads one way, but then you're like, ""How do you pull this off?"" I remember that day we showed up, he had a whole rig set up where they cut holes into the bottom of the mattress. We had about eight stunt people underneath me, choreographed the whole thing to where they stuck their hands through, and it was such a well-oiled machine from all the practical effects they did.

Even the one where I'm hanging over the bathtub, which is in the trailer, and they built a whole bathroom set on top of a 15-foot tank. There was a board underneath that would drop through whenever I needed to fall into the water. It was physically challenging, but I enjoyed jumping into things like that, so I told Chuck early on that I was pretty much game for anything he threw my way. We would bounce off each other a bit, and he would get excited when I got excited, and so we were a match made in heaven.

Was there any other sequence that stood out, and you might have had a hard time with?

I feel all the sequences on their own were a bit of a challenge. One of the sequences, I'm in the scene, but I'm not deep into what they're doing. There is a huge choreographed sequence about halfway through where a bunch of people get murdered. It was this incredible sequence, and we had such an incredible team behind the whole thing. It was a chaotic madhouse of everything. It was so beautifully done, but that was one of those things I remember reading it on the page, being like, ""Okay, this is going to be a feat to get through."" The fun part about that sequence is I'm standing off to the edge, which ended up being so great, because I was able to watch everyone do their incredible work and see it from the side. That was probably one of the most impressive sequences I got to witness, our whole time filming.

What'd you like about working with Aaron and Jamie on set?

They both have become such good friends of mine. They're both so sweet, and some of the most present actors I've ever worked with. Aaron's been such a dear friend, and he's so good as Christian. He's so grounded and brings our movie home, which is what I love so much about his character, because we're all these larger-than-life people in these larger-than-life experiences.

Jamie's so good and so talented. He had all the exposition in our film, so no one else could do it better than Jamie, explaining all these crazy instances we're going through. Also, more than anything, we just had such a good time. There are some moments when we're doing the most insane things possible, and all you can do is laugh and have a good time. We had the best filming experience. It's crazy because we filmed this so long ago, around 2023. It's fun to watch it come out now, and everyone else finally gets to experience everything we got to do.

The Avenue and Highland's Witchboard, which also stars Melanie Jarnson, Charlie Tahan, and Antonia Desplat, comes to theaters on August 15th.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin met US President Donald Trump in Alaska, a video of their conversation after their joint press conference has gone viral. It showed the Russian leader's legs 'twitching suspiciously' as he bid farewell to Trump.

The Kremlin footage showed Putin's knee jolting repeatedly as he stood in a corner talking to his US counterpart, along with a translator, flanked by security teams and aides.

In the clip, the Russian leader kept dipping one knee as he stood beside Trump, making his legs appear wobbly, as he continued to raise his left toe and heel.

Ukrainian social media users and news outlets were quick to float conspiracy theories to explain the Russian leader's actions. While some accused him of wearing ""hidden platforms"" in his shoes due to a “Napoleon complex”, others claimed that he donned an ""exoskeleton” to better his posture.

On X, many began theorising that the twitching and “jelly legs” were caused by a ""mysterious"" health condition. ""Putin may be suffering from a mysterious illness. The 72-year-old Putin with a swollen face is suffering from jelly legs (uncontrollable leg twitching),"" claimed one user.

Another remarked, “What the heck is wrong with Putin? Look at his body, almost convulsing, unable to stand still.”

Others theorised that the Russian leader never landed in Alaska and a body double was sent in his place to meet Trump. ""I don't think a KGB Master Spy would shake his legs so much when standing. This guy ain't Putin,"" said one of them.

Many also pointed to Putin's absence of his usual “gunslinger gait.” The Russian leader usually walks with one arm still by his side and the other swinging, likely due to his KGB training, in which agents hold a gun close to themselves when walking.

Home » Hollywood News

Zach Cregger's horror thriller Weapons turned into a surprise crowd-puller and critical favorite. All thanks to its unsettling blend of mystery, gore, and psychological dread. Fronted by Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, and Amy Madigan, the movie dives into a small town terrorized after 17 children inexplicably abandon their homes one night.

They later vanish into the woods as if under a spell. The culprit, a parasitic evil with an appetite for human life, eventually faces destruction. But the chaos it leaves behind is laced with unanswered puzzles. And like any good genre hit, those loose ends are the ones people can't stop talking about.

Dream sequences in horror films usually scream “symbolism,” and Weapons delivered one that viewers haven't stopped dissecting. In a particularly eerie moment, Archer Graff (Josh Brolin) nods off in his missing son's bed and dreams of a hovering assault rifle hanging above the Lilly house, the place where the missing children are kept. The weapon ticks out the exact time of their departure, which is 2:17 a.m., and ever since, fans have been drawing connections. Many argue it's tied to the film's title and even to real-world violence, especially considering how grief, anger, and the survival of one bullied child dominate the town's storyline.

But if you ask Cregger, he'll be the first to tell you there's no single explanation. Talking to Variety, he admitted, “It's a very important moment for me in this movie, and to be frank with you, I think what I love about it so much is that I don't understand it. I have a few different ideas of what it might be there for, but I don't have the right answer. I like the idea that everyone is probably going to have their own kind of interaction or their own relationship with that scene, whether they don't give a shit about it and it's boring, or whether they think it's some sort of political statement, or whether they think it's just cool.”

So while the floating gun may look like a clear metaphor, Zach Cregger insists it isn't meant as a manifesto. The sequence exists more as a provocation, the kind of surreal imagery that pushes an audience into debate without handing them a conclusion.

just got out of weapons but I keep thinking to myself, what was the purpose of the floating gun above the dads house and it showing 217… like that was so random and not elaborated on at all #WeaponsMovie #Weapons

If anyone walked out of the theater unsure about who or what Aunt Gladys really was, that's exactly how Cregger wanted it. Played with unnerving calm by Amy Madigan, Gladys is introduced as a relative, but quickly unmasked as the story's true villain. Her powers don't come from a normal source; she thrives by siphoning the life force of others. Gladys stretches her existence far beyond any ordinary lifespan.

Hints about her past drop throughout the movie. At one point, Gladys refers to “consumption,” an outdated term for tuberculosis, suggesting she has lived since at least the late 1800s. Early drafts reportedly gave her an entire backstory chapter, but Cregger scrapped it in favor of ambiguity. The result is a character who feels ancient, almost mythological, without ever being explained outright.

Her presence ties into the central theme of parasitism, like how evil feeds, grows, and refuses to die unless completely burned out. That makes Gladys less of a stock witch and more of an embodiment of generational darkness, the kind of antagonist who lingers in folklore long after her last scene fades.

No horror movie is complete without one creepy object, and in Weapons, that item is Gladys' bell. Covered in cryptic markings, the bell becomes her most lethal tool. It is not just an accessory, but the key to unleashing possession. Its engravings include an inverted triangle and the number six, both steeped in occult history.

In witchcraft, the triangle (especially inverted) is often tied to the Crone goddess and feminine mysticism. The number six, on its own, is already linked with the idea of devilry, and when repeated (666), becomes synonymous with ultimate evil. Put together, the carvings on the bell read less like random designs and more like a label of ownership. This was Gladys' weapon, a ritual device meant to seal curses once she brewed them.

The details don't stop there. Viewers who stayed through the credits spotted the triangle flipped upright in the closing sequence. That small adjustment may hint at something alchemical, a nod to potions and transformations. Paired with the blackthorn branches she uses to control victims, the bell's role feels less ornamental and more central to her craft.

In the end, the exact function of the symbols is never spelled out, but that's the point. Like much of Weapons, the bell leaves audiences piecing together lore from scraps, a mystery preserved by design. One that may be explored further if the rumored prequel plans come to fruition.

WEAPONS SPOILERS-

–Something I haven't seen anyone discuss is the fact that the triangle in the title screen and the bell Aunt Gladys rings is the alchemist symbol for “fire”, but in a more metaphorical sense. Gladys is LITERALLY “firing” the kids as weapons.

President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff — one of three American participants in Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin — described on Sunday several major agreements reached during the Alaska talks that he said created strong momentum toward a peace agreement with Ukraine.
    


            Witkoff told CNN that Putin had signed off on allowing “robust” security guarantees as part of an eventual peace accord, including a provision that would provide for a collective defense of Ukraine by the United States and Europe should Russia attempt another invasion.
    


            “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as game changing,” Witkoff told Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” adding the Russians had also pledged “legislative enshrinement” of a promise not to invade Ukraine or another European country in any forthcoming peace plan.
    


            Neither provision has been mentioned in Russian accounts of the summit.
    


            Witkoff's public description of Friday's summit was the most fulsome yet of what was discussed for nearly three hours behind closed doors in Anchorage. Trump will meet Monday at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and several European leaders to discuss the matter in more detail.
    


            Still, many questions remained about how the US is assessing Putin's seriousness about reaching a deal, whether his promises can be trusted after a track record of violating previous peace agreements and what exactly Trump is willing to offer to ensure Ukraine isn't invaded again.
    


            Heading into Friday's meeting, Trump said he would be disappointed if a ceasefire wasn't reached and threatened “severe” consequences on Russia if Putin didn't end the fighting.
    


            But as he departed, Trump said he was no longer aiming for an immediate ceasefire and declared “we don't have to think” about sanctions after the talks.
    


            Witkoff said significant progress during the summit led Trump to abandon his push for an immediate ceasefire and instead work toward advancing a larger peace agreement.
    


            “We made so much progress at this meeting with regard to all the other ingredients necessary for a for a peace deal that we, that President Trump, pivoted to that place,” Witkoff said.
    


            The other US participant in the talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offered a more guarded assessment of how close a peace agreement may be.
    


            “We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off,” he said on ABC's “This Week.” “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement, we're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made.”
    


            He said later on CBS' “Face the Nation” that any agreement to end the war would cause disappointment on both sides.
    


            “It may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end to the war, there are things that Russia wants that it cannot get and there are things that Ukraine wants that it's not going to get,” he said.
    


            The agreements Witkoff described will be at the center of meetings Monday between Trump and Zelensky. A large delegation of European officials — including the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, the European Union and NATO — will accompany the Ukrainian leader for the talks.
    


            European leaders have been pressing Trump to follow through on his threat of tough new economic penalties on Russia, but Rubio cautioned such steps could scuttle progress on a peace deal.
    


            “The minute he takes those steps, all talks stop,” he said. “The minute we take those steps, there is no one left in the world to go talk to the Russians and try to get them to the table to reach a peace agreement.”
    


            A breakout session during Monday's talks at the White House will explore options for security guarantees for Ukraine that would ensure Russia is unable to re-invade the country once a peace deal is in place. Zelensky and European leaders have said such assurances are necessary as part of a peace accord.
    


            Witkoff said the clause agreed to by Russia — akin to NATO's “Article 5” agreement that an attack against one country is an attack against all — was a workaround for Russia's insistence Ukraine never be able to join NATO.
    


            He described it as the “first time we had ever heard the Russians agree” to such a provision being included in a peace deal.
    


            What the United States would contribute to the effort — versus the the Europeans — remained unclear. Trump has previously stated clearly that American troops won't be on the ground in Ukraine, and has said the onus is on European nations to take the lead in protecting it.
    


            Some officials believe a robust security infrastructure for Ukraine could make it easier for Zelensky to accept some of Russia's demands for land concessions as part of a peace deal.
    


            Putin has not abandoned some of his maximalist ideas, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donbas region, where Russia currently occupies large swaths of territory.
    


            But Witkoff said Putin did make some concessions on his land requirements, suggested the Russians now see “land swapping” occurring at the current frontlines of the war rather than the administrative boundaries of at least some of the five regions long in Putin's sights.
    


            “The Russians made some concessions at the table with regard to all five of those regions,” he said, adding the issue would be discussed with Zelensky on Monday and “hopefully we can cut through and make some decisions right then and there.”

At least three people have been killed and several others wounded in a mass shooting at a restaurant in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City, police have said.

Another eight people were wounded as shots were fired inside the Taste of the City Lounge at 903 Franklin Avenue in the Crown Heights neighborhood early on Sunday, officials said.

The three fatalities were said to be men of 27, 35, and of an unknown age.

The wounded have been rushed to the hospital, with no information on their condition so far.

The suspects in the shooting have not yet been identified, according to police.

A video from Brooklyn shows investigators working inside the restaurant, with pools of blood and broken glass on the floor.

Police said at least 36 shell casings had been found at the scene.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the incident “a terrible thing” and “an anomaly,” considering that “we have the lowest number of shooting incidents and shooting victims seven months into the year we have seen on record in the city of New York.”

The NYPD said earlier in August that it had recorded 412 shooting incidents and 489 shooting victims so far in 2025 – less than the previous record low of 426 shootings in 2017.

The EU and UK should not overestimate their influence on the settlement of the Ukraine conflict as the US will continue to play the leading role in the peace process with Russia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, met in Alaska on Friday for their first face-to-face encounter since 2018. Possible ways to resolve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine topped the agenda during the negotiations. Trump then held a phone call with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and the leaders of several Western European countries which are backing Kiev, including Merz, to inform them about his discussions with Putin.

The German chancellor told broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that “the talks have begun” on settling the Ukraine conflict, which escalated in February 2022.

“They will continue on Monday [when Zelensky is expected to arrive in Washington for a meeting with Trump], and of course, the Europeans will play a role,” he said.

However, Merz warned that Western Europe “must not overestimate ourselves. European unity is important, but the decisive role in this war will continue to be played by the US.”

Trump “has the power, both militarily and with appropriate sanctions, to influence Russia,” he claimed.

The “good news” that came from the Alaska summit is that “there are no territorial negotiations between Putin and Trump over the heads of Ukraine and the Europeans,” the chancellor added.

In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump insisted that Zelensky should “make the deal,” stressing that Putin “wants to see it done” and urging Western Europe to “get involved a little bit.”

Putin reiterated on Saturday that the elimination of the root causes of the crisis is key to the settlement of the conflict. According to Moscow, in order for lasting peace to be achieved, Ukraine should renounce its ambitions for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the current territorial realities.

BELGRADE, August 17. /TASS/. Mass riots took place late on Saturday night in a number of cities in Serbia, rioters attacked police officers, set fire to and destroyed offices of government agencies and political parties, Serbia's Interior Minister Ivica Dacic stated.

According to the minister, the most complicated situation has been reported in the city of Valjevo, where up to 4,000 people participated in protest actions. The offices of the Serbian Progressive Party were vandalized and set on fire.

""Fortunately, there was no one inside [the premises],"" Dacic said. ""Given the fact that the facility serves both as a residential and office building where people reside, a fire could have endangered their lives.""

According to the local police reports, some 1,300 people participated in protests across Belgrade and they cast Molotov cocktails at law enforcement officers.

Up to 500 protesters gathered in Novi Sad, where the 50-meter-long concrete roof above the entrance of the railway station in Serbia's second-largest city collapsed in 2024 killing 15 people.

""The police stepped in and restored public order in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Valjevo,"" Serbia's top interior official added.

According to him, a police officer was injured in Valjevo, while a total of 18 rioters were reported to be detained.

Protests gripped Serbia in November 2024, sparked by the Novi Sad railway station canopy collapse. The tragedy left 15 people dead. Protestors blame the government and demand snap parliamentary elections.

On Wednesday night, protests took place in several Serbian cities, accompanied by attacks on the premises of the ruling SPP and the Socialist Party of Serbia. Dacic said 27 police officers and more than 80 civilians were injured in the attacks that day. The largest number of victims were supporters of the SPP, who gathered at the local branches of the party.

According to the Interior Ministry, protesters threw stones and pyrotechnics at buildings, five official vehicles and 22 pieces of equipment were damaged. A total of 47 people were detained, 47 administrative and five criminal protocols were drawn up. One of the most serious incidents was the attack on the soldiers of the special forces Cobra by a group of about 100 people in Novi Sad. A warning shot was fired into the air to protect the military.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON, August 17. /TASS/. The United States believes that the European leaders are coming to Washington not to ""keep Vladimir Zelensky from being bullied"" into a bad deal, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

""This is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because Trump is going to bully Zelensky into a bad deal. We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come,"" Rubio told CBS.

""They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelensky from being bullied,"" Rubio said. ""They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the UK over the previous weekend.""

On August 15, a meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump took place at a military base in Alaska. The rendezvous lasted about three hours: there was a one-on-one discussion in the American leader's limousine on the way to the main venue for the talks and a narrow ""three-on-three"" meeting. The Russian side was also represented by Presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the American side was represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

In a statement to the press following the talks, Putin said that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and returning to cooperation, and invited Trump to Moscow. For his part, the US president announced the progress made in the talks, but noted that the parties had not managed to reach agreement.

After returning to Washington, Trump held a phone call with Vladimir Zelensky and later with the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland, and France, as well as with the NATO secretary general and the European Commission president. Later, Zelensky said that he would travel to Washington on Monday to discuss details of a potential peace deal with Trump.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) carried out a drone strike on Russian military logistics in the Voronezh region overnight, damaging infrastructure at a key transportation hub, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 17.

The operation was conducted together with Ukraine's State Border Guard Service and other units of the Armed Forces, the source said. 

The strike disrupted train traffic through the Lisky station, halting the supply of ammunition and troops to aid Russian forces fighting on Ukrainian territory, according to the source.

HUR described Lisky station as a key transportation hub for Russian military logistics.

Earlier on Aug. 17, Russian independent outlet Astra published footage purportedly showing a fire at the station following the attack. 

Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev confirmed a drone strike on a railway station in the region, though he did not name it. 

Gusev said a railway worker was injured, a power line was damaged, and several trains were delayed. Gusev added that the worker had been hospitalized and that train movement had since been restored. He also reported fires at a market, a store, and a gas pipeline in separate incidents in the region.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 46 Ukrainian drones overnight across several oblasts, including 16 over Belgorod Oblast, 14 over Nizhny Novgorod, nine over Voronezh Oblast, three over Bryansk Oblast, and one each over Kursk, Oryol, Kaluga, and Smolensk oblasts.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told journalists on Aug. 17.

According to the German government, the discussions will cover the state of peace efforts, security guarantees, territorial questions, continued support for Ukraine, and maintaining sanctions pressure.

The General Staff said Russian forces suffered significant losses in the area, including 910 killed, 335 wounded, and 37 captured. 

According to the presidential decree, restrictions were introduced against 39 Russian nationals and 55 companies from Russia, China, and Belarus. 

The Air Force said Russia launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile and 60 Shahed-type attack drones and drone decoys overnight on Aug. 17. 

The number includes 900 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Ukraine's military has reportedly advanced about two kilometers in Sumy oblast, just a day after Putin and Trump discussed a deal that would give unoccupied Ukrainian territories to Russia.

In an Aug. 16 video, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico praised the recent Putin-Trump summit in Alaska and repeated Kremlin propaganda about the ""root causes"" of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""If they do not have the will to implement a simple order to stop the attacks, it may take a great deal of effort to get Russia to implement something much more significant, namely peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades to come.""

""Ultimately it is Russia's responsibility to end its blatant violations of international law. Russia's aggression and imperialist ambitions are the root causes of this war,"" the Nordic-Baltic Eight said after Putin's meeting with Trump. 



The documents disclose the exact locations and meeting times of the summit and phone numbers of U.S. government staff. They also reveal other sensitive details, such as a menu for a luncheon in honor of ""His Excellency Vladimir Putin."" 

Trump appeared to endorse Russia's plan as the fastest way to a peace deal, abandoning the demand for a ceasefire and threats of sanctions agains Moscow, officials told the NYT. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The explosion at U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh-area plant has reignited debate about its future. The plant, part of a long-standing steelmaking tradition in the Mon Valley, faces uncertainty despite recent investments.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The fatal explosion last week at U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh-area coal-processing plant has revived debate about its future just as the iconic American company was emerging from a long period of uncertainty.

The fortunes of steelmaking in the U.S. — along with profits, share prices and steel prices — have been buoyed by years of friendly administrations in Washington that slapped tariffs on foreign imports and bolstered the industry's anti-competitive trade cases against China.

Most recently, President Donald Trump's administration postponed new hazardous air pollution requirements for the nation's roughly dozen coke plants, like Clairton, and he approved U.S. Steel's nearly $15 billion acquisition by Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel.

Nippon Steel's promised infusion of cash has brought vows that steelmaking will continue in the Mon Valley, a river valley south of Pittsburgh long synonymous with steelmaking.

“We're investing money here. And we wouldn't have done the deal with Nippon Steel if we weren't absolutely sure that we were going to have an enduring future here in the Mon Valley,” David Burritt, U.S. Steel's CEO, told a news conference the day after the explosion. ”You can count on this facility to be around for a long, long time.”




The explosion killed two workers and hospitalized 10 with a blast so powerful that it took hours to find two missing workers beneath charred wreckage and rubble. The cause is under investigation.

The plant is considered the largest coking operation in North America and, along with a blast furnace and finishing mill up the Monongahela River, is one of a handful of integrated steelmaking operations left in the U.S.

The explosion now could test Nippon Steel's resolve in propping up the nearly 110-year-old Clairton plant, or at least force it to spend more than it had anticipated.

Nippon Steel didn't respond to a question as to whether the explosion will change its approach to the plant. 

Rather, a spokesperson for the company said its “commitment to the Mon Valley remains strong” and that it sent “technical experts to work with the local teams in the Clairton Plant, and to provide our full support.”

Meanwhile, Burritt said he had talked to top Nippon Steel officials after the explosion and that “this facility and the Mon Valley are here to stay.”

U.S. Steel officials maintain that safety is their top priority and that they spend $100 million a year on environmental compliance at Clairton alone.

However, repairing Clairton could be expensive, an investigation into the explosion could turn up more problems, and an official from the United Steelworkers union said it's a constant struggle to get U.S. Steel to invest in its plants.

Besides that, production at the facility could be affected for some time. The plant has six batteries of ovens and two — where the explosion occurred — were damaged. Two others are on a reduced production schedule because of the explosion. 

There is no timeline to get the damaged batteries running again, U.S. Steel said.

Accidents are nothing new at Clairton, which heats coal to high temperatures to make coke, a key component in steelmaking, and produces combustible gases as byproducts.

An explosion in February injured two workers.

Even as Nippon Steel was closing the deal in June, a breakdown at the plant dealt three days of a rotten egg odor into the air around it from elevated hydrogen sulfide emissions, the environmental group GASP reported.

The Breathe Project, a public health organization, said U.S. Steel has been forced to pay $57 million in fines and settlements since Jan. 1, 2020, for problems at the Clairton plant.

A lawsuit over a Christmas Eve fire at the Clairton plant in 2018 that saturated the area's air for weeks with sulfur dioxide produced a withering assessment of conditions there. 

An engineer for the environmental groups that sued wrote that he “found no indication that U.S. Steel has an effective, comprehensive maintenance program for the Clairton plant.”

The Clairton plant, he wrote, is “inherently dangerous because of the combination of its deficient maintenance and its defective design.”

U.S. Steel settled, agreeing to spend millions on upgrades.

Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, said U.S. Steel has shown more willingness to spend money on fines, lobbying the government and buying back shares to reward shareholders than making its plants safe.

It's not clear whether Nippon Steel will change Clairton.

Central to Trump's approval of the acquisition was Nippon Steel's promises to invest $11 billion into U.S. Steel's aging plants and to give the federal government a say in decisions involving domestic steel production, including plant closings. 

But much of the $2.2 billion that Nippon Steel has earmarked for the Mon Valley plants is expected to go toward upgrading the finishing mill, or building a new one.

For years before the acquisition, U.S. Steel had signaled that the Mon Valley was on the chopping block. 

That left workers there uncertain whether they'd have jobs in a couple years and whispering that U.S. Steel couldn't fill openings because nobody believed the jobs would exist much longer.

In many ways, U.S. Steel's Mon Valley plants are relics of steelmaking's past. 

In the early 1970s, U.S. steel production led the world and was at an all-time high, thanks to 62 coke plants that fed 141 blast furnaces. Nobody in the U.S. has built a blast furnace since then, as foreign competition devastated the American steel industry and coal fell out of favor. 

Now, China is dominant in steel and heavily invested in coal-based steelmaking. In the U.S., there are barely a dozen coke plants and blast furnaces left, as the country's steelmaking has shifted to cheaper electric arc furnaces that use electricity, not coal. 

Blast furnaces won't entirely go away, analysts say, since they produce metals that are preferred by automakers, appliance makers and oil and gas exploration firms.

Still, Christopher Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Social and Urban Research, questioned whether the Clairton plant really will survive much longer, given its age and condition. It could be particularly vulnerable if the economy slides into recession or the fundamentals of the American steel market shift, he said.

“I'm not quite sure it's all set in stone as people believe,” Briem said. “If the market does not bode well for U.S. Steel, for American steel, is Nippon Steel really going to keep these things?”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday met with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, who announced that European and NATO leaders will join the summit.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — European and NATO leaders announced Sunday they will join President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington to present a united front in talks with President Donald Trump on ending Russia's war in Ukraine and firming up U.S. security guarantees now on the negotiating table.

Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Finland are rallying around the Ukrainian president after his exclusion from Trump's summit on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Their pledge to be at Zelenskyy's side at the White House on Monday is an apparent effort to ensure the meeting goes better than the last one in February, when Trump berated Zelenskyy in a heated Oval Office encounter.

“The Europeans are very afraid of the Oval Office scene being repeated and so they want to support Mr. Zelenskyy to the hilt,” said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France's military mission at the United Nations. 

“It's a power struggle and a position of strength that might work with Trump,” he said.

Putin agreed at his summit in Alaska with Trump that the U.S. and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union.”

It “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that,” said Witkoff, who called it “game-changing.”




Later, French President Emmanuel Macron said the European delegation will ask Trump to back plans they drafted to beef-up Ukraine's armed forces — already Europe's largest outside of Russia — with more training and equipment to secure any peace.

“We need a credible format for the Ukrainian army, that's the first point, and say — we Europeans and Americans — how we'll train them, equip them, and finance this effort in the long-term,” the French leader said.

The European-drafted plans also envision an allied force in Ukraine away from the front lines to reassure Kyiv that peace will hold and to dissuade another Russian invasion, Macron said. He spoke after a nearly two-hour video call Sunday with nations in Europe and further afield — including Canada, Australia and Japan — that are involved in the so-called “coalition of the willing.”

The “several thousand men on the ground in Ukraine in the zone of peace” would signal that “our fates are linked,” Macron said.

“This is what we must discuss with the Americans: Who is ready to do what?” Macron said. “Otherwise, I think the Ukrainians simply cannot accept commitments that are theoretical.” 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said earlier at a news conference in Brussels with Zelenskyy that “we welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine. And the ‘coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share.”

Macron said the substance of security guarantees will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label.

“A theoretical article isn't enough, the question is one of substance,” he said. “We must start out by saying that the first of the security guarantees for Ukraine is a strong Ukrainian army.”

Along with Von der Leyen and Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb also said they'll will take part in Monday's talks, as will secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, Mark Rutte.

The European leaders' support could help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal.

Neil Melvin, director of international security at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said European leaders are trying to “shape this fast-evolving agenda.” After the Alaska summit, the idea of a ceasefire appears all-but-abandoned, with the narrative shifting toward Putin's agenda of ensuring Ukraine does not join NATO or even the EU.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday that a possible ceasefire is “not off the table” but that the best way to end the war would be through a “full peace deal.”

Putin has implied that he sees Europe as a hindrance to negotiations. He has also resisted meeting Zelenskyy in person, saying that such a meeting can only take place once the groundwork for a peace deal has been laid.

Speaking to the press after his meeting with Trump, the Russian leader raised the idea that Kyiv and other European capitals could “create obstacles” to derail potential progress with “behind-the-scenes intrigue.”

For now, Zelenskyy offers the Europeans the “only way” to get into the discussions about the future of Ukraine and European security, says RUSI's Melvin.

However, the sheer number of European leaders potentially in attendance means the group will have to be “mindful” not to give “contradictory” messages, Melvin said.

“The risk is they look heavy-handed and are ganging up on Trump,” he added. “Trump won't want to be put in a corner.” 

Although details remain hazy on what Article 5-like security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe would entail for Ukraine, it could mirror NATO membership terms, in which an attack on one member of the alliance is seen as an attack on all.

Zelenskyy continues to stress the importance of both U.S. and European involvement in any negotiations.

“A security guarantee is a strong army. Only Ukraine can provide that. Only Europe can finance this army, and weapons for this army can be provided by our domestic production and European production. But there are certain things that are in short supply and are only available in the United States,” he said at the press conference Sunday alongside Von der Leyen.

Zelenskyy also pushed back against Trump's assertion — which aligned with Putin's preference — that the two sides should negotiate a complete end to the war, rather than first securing a ceasefire. Zelenskyy said a ceasefire would provide breathing room to review Putin's demands.

“It's impossible to do this under the pressure of weapons,” he said. “Putin does not want to stop the killing, but he must do it.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.

West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention.

The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. 

By adding outside troops to the existing D.C. Guard deployment and federal law enforcement presence, Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.

National Guard members have played a limited role in the federal intervention so far, and it's unclear why additional troops are needed. They have been patrolling at landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station and assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control.




The Republican governors of the three states said they were sending hundreds of troops at the request of the Trump administration.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he directed 300 to 400 Guard troops to head to Washington, adding that the state “is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital.” 

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen to help law enforcement in Washington at the Pentagon's request. He noted that if a hurricane or other natural disaster strikes, they would be recalled.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police from the Guard to “carry out presence patrols and serve as added security” and that they were expected to arrive in the coming days. His statement said Army Secretary Dan Driscoll requested the troops.

The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.

A protest against Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, “No fascist takeover of D.C.,” and some in the crowd held signs saying, “No military occupation.” 

Morgan Taylor, one of the protest organizers, said they were hoping to spark enough backlash to Trump's actions that the administration would be forced to pull back on its crime and immigration agenda.

“It's hot, but I'm glad to be here. It's good to see all these people out here,” she said. “I can't believe that this is happening in this country at this time.”

Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreaching and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington.

John Finnigan, 55, was taking a bike ride when he ran into the protest in downtown Washington. The real estate construction manager who has lived in the capital for 27 years said Trump's moves were “ridiculous” because crime is down.

“Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities,” Finnigan said.

Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for the safety or her students given the “unmarked officers of all types” now roaming Washington and detaining people.

Dickstein said she turned out to the protest with friends and relatives to “prevent a continuous domino effect going forward with other cities.”

Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.

City leaders, who are obliged to cooperate with Trump's order under the federal laws that direct the district's local governance, have sought to work with the administration, though they have bristled at the scope of the president's takeover.

On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an “emergency police commissioner” after the district's top lawyer sued. 

After a court hearing, Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, issued a memo directing the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law. 

City officials say they are evaluating how to best comply.

In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government's failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.”

In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.” 

She added that if Washington residents stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy — even when we don't have full access to it.”

Former Vice President Mike Pence said he ""welcomed"" President Donald Trump's actions to combat crime in Washington, D.C., during an interview on CNN, Sunday.

Former Vice President Mike Pence said he supported President Donald Trump's action to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C., when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday.

During an appearance on ""State of the Union,"" Pence was asked what he thought about Trump sending hundreds of National Guard troops to the nation's capital, after Trump faced criticism for how he responded to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

""Here in Washington, D.C., President Trump has deployed the National Guard and other federal troops, ostensibly in response to emergency of lawlessness and high crime in D.C.,"" Tapper began in his question to Pence.

""I am curious what goes through your mind when you see the president aggressively pushing out the National Guard when he didn‘t do so on January 6th, 2021, as the Capitol was under attack, a mob was trying to lynch you and your family was in danger?"" Tapper asked.

CNN'S DANA BASH ROASTED FOR CALLING JAN. 6 ‘MOST VIOLENT MOMENT IN RECENT HISTORY' AFTER TRUMP CRIME PRESSER

Pence called January 6 ""a tragic day,"" before praising Trump's efforts to combat crime in the city. 

He defended the president temporarily taking control of D.C.'s police force as an ""important"" step to tackle the city's high homicide rate.

""Well, January 6th was a tragic day. But I know we did our duty that day, and I wish the president would have done more. But I welcome his decision to deploy the National Guard and essentially federalize the D.C. police department,"" Pence said. ""I know that it‘s all now working in a very cooperative way.""

FORMER CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF SAYS CRIME BY ‘GANGS OF YOUTH' IN DC HAS SPIKED, ESCAPED ‘CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS'

""Jake, if the District of Columbia was actually a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country,"" he added. ""And this is where our national government has to operate, where tens of thousands of people, you included, work every day. I think it's important what the president is doing. I fully support it. And I think the American people welcome the president taking decisive action to ensure the streets of our nation's capital are safe and also continue to provide resources across the country to make all of our cities and towns and communities safe.""

Top Democrats across the country have pushed back on Trump's actions, claiming that violent crime is at a 30-year-low, a statistic challenged by some law enforcement experts.

""Violent crime in Washington, D.C., is at a thirty-year low,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on Monday. ""Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.""

During a press conference on Monday, President Trump claimed the homicide rate in D.C. is higher than that in notoriously violent cities in nations across the world.

""The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,"" Trump said Monday. 

""This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse,"" he added.

Fox News Digital spoke with APCO International Executive Director and CEO Mel Maier on the need to invest in next-generation 911. 

Healthcare institutions have become a favorite target for bad actors, largely because of how easy they make it for attackers. In June, researchers discovered a healthcare data breach that exposed the personal information of around 8 million patients. All of this information was publicly accessible online without any passwords or authentication protocols.

The latest healthcare organization to fall victim to a breach is DaVita, which has put nearly a million people at risk. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita provides dialysis treatment to about 200,000 patients across the U.S. and 13 other countries.

DIOR DATA BREACH EXPOSES US CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION

Kidney dialysis giant DaVita says nearly 916,000 people had personal and medical information exposed in an April ransomware attack (via Comparitech). The breach, which the company disclosed in state filings, compromised names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance details, medical records, tax ID numbers, addresses and even images of checks made out to the company.

DaVita says the incident disrupted internal operations and primarily affected its laboratories. In its latest notice to victims, the company says the cyberattack began March 24, 2025, and continued until April 12. It has not confirmed whether a ransom was paid.

Ransomware gang Interlock claimed responsibility on April 25, posting screenshots of alleged stolen documents and saying it took 1.5TB of DaVita's data. The group lists the company on its public leak site, where it pressures victims by threatening to sell or release stolen files.

DaVita is offering eligible breach victims free identity restoration services through Experian, with a Nov. 28 enrollment deadline. The company has not confirmed how attackers gained access to its network or the size of the ransom demand.

CyberGuy reached out to DaVita for comment but did not receive a response before publication.

Interlock, which first appeared in October 2024, has claimed responsibility for the DaVita attack and at least 23 other ransomware attacks, plus dozens more that remain unverified. Healthcare targets have included Texas Digestive Specialists, Kettering Health and Naper Grove Vision Care, all of which reported data breaches in 2025.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

The DaVita incident is the second-largest U.S. healthcare ransomware attack by number of records this year, behind Frederick Health's January breach. According to Comparitech, there have been 53 confirmed ransomware attacks on American healthcare providers in 2025 alone, compromising more than 3.2 million patient records.

The DaVita data breach exposed sensitive patient information. If you are affected or just want to stay one step ahead, these actions can help minimize your risk.

The DaVita data breach likely gives attackers access to your contact details, which they can misuse. Avoid clicking on unexpected emails or messages, even if they look legitimate.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

Since your personal details were exposed in the DaVita breach, you're more vulnerable to targeted fraud. Consider using a personal data removal service to scrub your personal details from data broker websites that sell your information.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.

Reusing passwords increases your risk. A single leaked password can unlock multiple accounts. Use a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.

DaVita is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't a victim of this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself.

Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.

See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at  Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft

Adding a second layer of login protection, like a text message or app-based code via 2FA, can make it much harder for DaVita attackers to access your accounts, even if your password is exposed.

Keep an eye out for strange charges or unfamiliar accounts. Set up alerts through your bank and review your credit report regularly to catch fraud early.

The investigation into the DaVita breach is ongoing, and the company has not disclosed how the hackers got in. Nearly a million people now face the possibility of their personal information being used for malicious purposes. Ransomware attacks on hospitals and clinics can lock critical systems, delay care and push providers back to paper records. In severe cases, they can force appointment cancellations and patient diversions and potentially endanger lives.

Three people were killed and another eight were wounded in a mass shooting at a New York City club early Sunday morning.

Gunfire began around 3:30 a.m. inside the Taste of the City Lounge in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Authorities believe a “dispute” took place involving multiple suspects prior to the shooting.

As of Sunday morning, no suspects have been identified or apprehended.

The three deceased victims were all men and were pronounced dead at the crime scene. The eight other victims, five men and three women, were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. The 11 victims ranged in age from 27 to 61.

The shooting comes amid a record low year for gun violence in New York City.

“We have the lowest number of shooting incidents and shooting victims seven months into the year that we've seen on record in the city of New York,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters during a brief press conference.

During the first seven months of this year, New York City experienced 412 shooting incidents with 489 shooting victims. Those numbers are down from the previous record lows in 2017 and 2018, according to the NYPD. Last month also set new record lows, starting with the July 4 holiday weekend, which saw the lowest shooting totals ever recorded for the three-day period.

“Something like this is, of course, thank God, an anomaly, and it's a terrible thing that happened this morning, but we're going to investigate and get to the bottom of what went down,” Tisch said.

At least 36 shell casings were found at the crime scene, police said. Officers recovered a firearm near the scene and are trying to determine whether it was used in the shooting. No other details were immediately provided.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In this article

A softer-than-expected July inflation report has improved investor sentiment and revived hopes for a rate cut. Traders await more economic data to gain further insights about the state of the U.S. economy.

Looking beyond macro uncertainties and tariff pressures, it is always a good idea for investors to search for stocks that have strong long-term growth potential and enhance their portfolio returns. To this end, recommendations from top Wall Street analysts can help pick attractive stocks, as these experts perform an in-depth analysis of a company's financials and growth prospects.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is social media platform Pinterest (PINS). The company recently reported mixed results for the second quarter of 2025. While second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, earnings missed the Street's consensus estimate. Meanwhile, Pinterest's third-quarter revenue outlook topped analysts' estimates.

In reaction to the Q2 print, BMO Capital analyst Brian Pitz increased the price forecast for Pinterest stock to $41 from $40 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on PINS stock with a price target of $40.

Pitz noted that Pinterest delivered upbeat revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) in the quarter, fueled by the company's solid execution and the strength in the retail and financial services businesses. However, the analyst pointed out that Q2 performance was adversely impacted by a 25% drop in advertising pricing resulting from the company's rising market share in previously unmonetized markets around the globe.

Pitz views Pinterest as a ""Clear AI Winner."" While users are gaining from AI-powered search functions and algorithm upgrades on PINS' platform, advertisers are using Performance+ Creative Preview to observe modifications made by PINS+ creative tools and maximize ad efficiency.

""As AI continues to drive enhancements, we see it as a clear tailwind for PINS to both improve user experience and drive greater efficiency,"" said Pitz.

The analyst added that advertisers are also benefiting from Pinterest's useful customer insights, given that Gen-Z now constitutes more than half the platform's user base.

Pitz ranks No. 95 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 72% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.

We next move to the AI cloud computing company CoreWeave (CRWV), which reported market-beating revenue for the second quarter and issued better-than-anticipated top-line guidance for the third quarter. However, the AI infrastructure company reported a larger-than-expected loss for the second quarter.

Following the Q2 results, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on CoreWeave stock with a price target of $180. The 5-star analyst highlighted the 86% year-over-year jump in CRWV's remaining performance obligations (RPO). However, Thill noted the disappointment related to the limited sequential upside in RPO compared to the high buyside expectations following the $4 billion expanded deal with OpenAI signed in May.

Nonetheless, Thill remains optimistic, given that CoreWeave signed expansion deals with two hyperscalers, which he believes reflects ""the unrelenting demand for high performance compute and CRWV's best in class capabilities.""

Thill's bullish view on the company's backlog is also supported by the ramp-up in its capacity. Notably, CoreWeave added 600 megawatts of contracted power, bringing the total capacity to 2.2 gigawatts. Overall, the analyst is confident about RPO acceleration going forward, given that AI demand continues to exceed supply.

Thill ranks No. 317 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.3%. See CoreWeave Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at the well-known coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX). Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded Starbucks stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $115 from $100.

Tarantino has ""high conviction that turnaround strategies under new leadership will be effective in transforming Starbucks into a better company.""

Given the recent underperformance of SBUX stock – which has sunk by 16% over the past six months – Tarantino believes that it now has an improved risk/reward profile. He expects the turnaround initiatives under chairman and CEO Brian Niccol to drive improvement in U.S. comparable sales in Fiscal 2026. The company's turnaround initiatives are focused on ensuring high levels of hospitality and a faster speed of service in stores.

Moreover, Tarantino expects to gain more visibility on SBUX's earnings outlook over the upcoming quarters, as the impact of the turnaround efforts starts to become clear. In particular, the analyst expects more details on Starbucks' cost-saving initiatives and greater clarity on store-level labor investments to provide insights into the company's long-term aim to revive its operating margin to the level of 17% seen in Fiscal 2019, compared to 10.3% in Fiscal 2025.

Overall, Tarantino expects SBUX's multiple to expand on signs of improvement in financial performance, driven by the company's turnaround efforts.

Tarantino ranks No. 441 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.8%. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is not quite as keen as Tarantino, assigning a ""neutral"" rating on SBUX stock with a price target of $99.  See Starbucks Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

One of the most common myths about long-term relationships is that couples eventually run out of things to say. It's easy to believe: Life gets busy, routines take over and conversations become more about logistics than connection.

As a psychologist who studies couples, and based on my own experience being happily married, I know how tricky communication can become if you're convinced there's nothing left to say. But couples in healthy relationships make a habit of talking about things that matter, every single day.

Their conversations stay fresh, connected and meaningful because they never stop learning about each other. Here are five things people in the happiest relationships talk to each other about every day — that most people neglect.

Couples in thriving relationships always make a point to check in and make sure the other partner is happy.

On some days, that means asking: ""Do you feel loved? Supported? Connected?"" Other days, it's about expressing appreciation, sharing a laugh over a favorite memory or talking about something they're looking forward to doing together.

Having these daily check-ins help prevent small misunderstandings from growing into larger issues.

In the strongest relationships, both partners stay curious about what excites the other. It could be a song they can't stop listening to, a book they've been devouring, a hobby they're exploring or even a TikTok that made them laugh.

Regardless of whether their interests overlap, they stay curious about each other's passions. This is what keeps the spark alive.

Over their years together, these little updates remind one another of perhaps the most important thing to remember in a relationship: ""We're constantly growing and evolving, and we're doing it together.""

Happy couples are never stuck in the present or past. They often have conversations about long-term goals: owning a home, traveling more, starting a business or raising kids.

They also don't shy away from less practical, more whimsical topics, like what they'd do with a year off, how they'd renovate their dream kitchen or where they'd go if money wasn't a concern.

Discussing dreams, no matter how realistic or farfetched, keeps the relationship future-oriented by instilling a joint sense of purpose and possibility. Even if a dream can't be acted on right away, talking it over allows them to keep track of each other's values.

Happy couples aren't uncomfortable bringing up what's bothering them. A healthy relationship should feel like a safe space where couples can work through their troubles together as a team.

Whether it's a tough day at work, a lingering insecurity or even a fear about the relationship itself, they trust their partner to respond with empathy.

Over time, this daily practice of being emotionally honest builds a rock-solid sense of safety. Both partners will never feel like they have to carry their baggage alone.

Even a half-formed musing can be a fun way to connect. Happy couples never think twice about sharing their random ideas: their shower thoughts, their ""what-ifs,"" their ""this just popped into my head"" theories.

And these don't always have to be deep or profound. In fact, they're usually pretty silly, weird or seemingly irrelevant. Adding a little bit of playfulness and spontaneity into every conversation also makes space for laughter and even intimacy.

I always remind couples that a big part of building a successful relationship is about being intentional with the conversations you choose to have. Couples who stay connected day after day create a shared space for curiosity, growth and joy.

President Donald Trump's media group, Trump Media, made headlines in July when it purchased a staggering $2 billion in bitcoin and securities.

Read Next: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too

Trump Media made the bold move as a follow-up to its announcement made in May, when the company declared it had raised $2.5 billion in funding to make the purchase — all part of a plan for Trump Media to become a bitcoin treasury company, as reported by Yahoo Finance.

Devin Nunes, CEO and president of Trump Media, described the purchase as a means to “[rigorously implement] our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan. These assets help insure our company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere.”

Trump Media's massive bitcoin purchase not only shored up enough crypto to facilitate the company's bitcoin treasury plan, it also gave shares of Trump Media a boost in the stock market. Following the $2 billion acquisition, shares of Trump Media increased by 5.6% — or $1.04, to an overall total of $19.71 — after a bumpy 2025 that has seen the company's stock dip by 42%, per CBS News.

Considering investing in Trump Media? Despite its previously-rocky standing on the stock market, having its own bitcoin treasury could radically benefit the company for investors. Specifically, if bitcoin values continue to rise, so too would Trump Media's holdings, thus benefitting Trump Media shareholders.

Additionally, having that massive level of liquidity helps to protect (in some degree) Trump Media investors from the kind of significant loses it had suffered earlier this year, per AInvest. Also, as Fortune noted, purchasing shares of Trump Media allows for a kind of indirect exposure to the crypto and digital-asset market, in case you're a skittish investor who doesn't want to take the full dive into the world of crypto.

It's important to remember that Trump Media, President Trump and bitcoin remain volatile entities, especially in this era of economic and regulatory uncertainty. Investing in Trump Media would definitely be a speculative move — you should be aware of yours risk tolerance before betting on such combustive (but potentially rewarding) investments.

What this means for investors is that while Trump Media will continue to be a high-risk investment, its level of high-reward has increased significantly with its efforts to create its own bitcoin treasury — and the financial independence that level of liquidity provides.

The trend of publicly traded companies adopting crypto treasury strategies may have started with Bitcoin, but it has since expanded to a wide variety of digital assets—including the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum. 

Now the race to accumulate ETH is on, led by key figures like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, who are championing public firms as they rally around Ethereum and its future. 

Per StrategicETHReserve.xyz, public entities with Ethereum treasuries maintain more than 3.7 million ETH valued at nearly $17 billion, as of this writing, and more than 3% of the entire supply. These are the biggest holders as of this writing.

Led by crypto bull and Fundstrat CIO Tom Lee, BitMine Immersion Technologies burst onto the scene at the end of July when the firm detailed plans for an Ethereum treasury. 

Formerly focused on Bitcoin mining, BitMine (BMNR) first secured a $250 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) fundraising round to begin its ETH purchases. 

Since that time, it hasn't looked back, acquiring 1,150,263 ETH or more than $5 billion worth as of this writing.

The aggressive buying spree has coincided with Lee's seemingly unfathomable ETH price predictions, which include calls for $60,000 ETH. That's a sizable multiple of the current price.

After planning a raise of $4.5 billion to accumulate the asset, Lee and company upsized their offering by $20 billion in August as BitMine aims to expand its already industry-leading Ethereum treasury. 

Gambling marketer turned Ethereum treasury company SharpLink Gaming holds the second-largest publicly traded ETH treasury. 

The firm maintains 728,804 ETH, or $3.2 billion as of its latest release—around 73% of the way to its first stated goal of accumulating 1 million ETH. 

While SharpLink's existing business did not have immediate ties to crypto, it brought on direct ties to Ethereum when it shaped its board of directors. The firm's chairman Joe Lubin is the co-founder of Ethereum itself, and founder and CEO of Ethereum software company, Consensys, the maker of popular crypto wallet, MetaMask.

(Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt)

Lubin and company have followed BitMine in a relentless pursuit of Ethereum, raising funds in a variety of ways including a recent $400 million direct offering, plus plans to collect up to $6 billion via stock sales. 

In July, the firm added BlackRock's former head of digital asset strategy Joseph Chalom as its newly appointed CEO. 

There's no questioning the business of The Ether Machine, a firm made public via a merger of The Ether Reserve, LLC and a blank-check company earlier this year. 

The third-largest treasury on the list, The Ether Machine currently holds 345,362 ETH, or $1.5 billion at today's ETH prices. 

Funded with startup capital and approximately 170,000 ETH from co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys, the Ether Machine stated a mandate to put its ETH to work on-chain or create a “machine” to grow its stash, differentiating it from more passive accumulation vehicles. 

It most recently acquired around $40 million worth of ETH using cash from a previously established private placement. At the time of inception, it expected to pull in around $1.6 billion in total proceeds to use to fund Ethereum purchases.

Leading American crypto exchange Coinbase maintains an investment of around $602 million or 136,782 ETH, according to its most recent 10-Q filing. That is more than 20,000 ETH greater than it ended 2024 with when it held 115,700 ETH based on an end of year 10-K filing.

The firm also holds more than 11,000 Bitcoin as an investment, placing it among the top publicly traded holders of the largest crypto asset, as well.  

First hitting the public markets in 2021, shares in Coinbase made a new all-time high in July 2025 as crypto firms continued a streak of success alongside traditional equities. 

Bitcoin miner Bit Digital formed an Ethereum treasury strategy during Q2 2025. In just a few short months, it's quickly added to its stash, jumping from 30,663 ETH at the end of June to 121,076 ETH as of August 11—now valued at more than $530 million. 

As part of its transition, the firm is ending its Bitcoin mining operations and redeploying funds towards ETH accumulation. Public markets didn't react strongly to the strategy shift, as shares of BTBT have gained just 2.63% year-to-date. 

Biotech firm 180 Life Sciences rebranded its company to “ETHZilla,” as it shifted focus to a digital assets treasury centered on Ethereum. 

The firm raised $425 million in late July to kickstart its treasury and quickly jumped up the holder rankings, acquiring 82,186 ETH as of August 12, valued around $362 million at today's ETH prices. 

A few weeks later, shares in ETHZilla (ATNF) quickly tripled after it was revealed that billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel and related entities had purchased a 7.5% stake in the company. 

As for its unique name? Chairman of the board McAndrew Rudisil told Decrypt in July that it  “comes from our focus to be one of the largest holders of ETH in the world.”

Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS) holds 70,140 ETH, worth around $309 million as of mid-August.

The firm boasts a proactive strategy to acquire more Ethereum, putting its ETH to work on-chain using what is described as a “powerful DeFi/TradFi financial model” to generate value for shareholders. 

In addition to acquiring ETH, the firm also bolstered its treasury with three Ethereum-based Pudgy Penguins NFTs in August.

BTCS has joined the Pudgy Party!

BTCS posted record revenues in Q2 of $2.77 million, marking a 394% increase year-over-year. Shares are up nearly 90% year-to-date.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","XRP vs. ADA vs. ETH: We Asked 4 AIs Which Is the Most Popular Altcoin (Answer Is Surprising)","https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-vs-ada-vs-eth-we-asked-4-ais-which-is-the-most-popular-altcoin-answer-is-surprising/","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:51:20 GMT","

Which is the most popular alt, according to ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Perplexity?

TL;DR



It's worth noting that this article does not aim to examine the three altcoins' market performance, price movements, or overall size (or any other honorable mentions that might appear from the AIs' answers). That's more than evident and can be reviewed on every big data aggregator such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.

It aims to explore the fan base behind these three. On why we chose ETH, XRP, and ADA in particular – it's simple – we usually see the most interest in articles related to them (and a few others, but they will appear later on, so stay tuned).

All four AIs tried to compare the altcoins by several factors, including market cap, which, as we said, we will leave out. Instead, we asked them to look for Google searches, social media engagement, projects' followers count, reposts, surveys, etc.

ChatGPT determined that the search interest and social media posts regarding Ethereum have risen to the highest levels since 2021, fueled by “ETF milestones and surging institutional interest.” However, XRP queries have “surpassed Ethereum's, reaching up to 10x more popular in global search data during the late 2024-2025 period.”

In ChatGPT's words, ETH and XRP lead in their own niches, while ADA trails behind both:

While OpenAI's chatbot was relatively political in its final answer, giving ETH and XRP essentially equal popularity votes, the other three AIs seemed conclusive and determined that the largest altcoin rules. However, that could be because they failed to exclude the market performance and dominance from the equation.

“While all three are highly popular altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) is the most popular and dominant by a wide margin, based on its market capitalization, extensive developer community, and the foundational role it plays in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem,” – said Gemini.

Perplexity was even more adamant about ETH's dominance:

“Ethereum is currently the most popular altcoin—by user base, institutional adoption, volume, and overall influence—far exceeding both XRP and ADA, as well as other trending contenders in the market.”

It also had a few honorable mentions outside of this trio, such as SOL, DOGE, and TON, all of which are “trending or gaining major traction in specific communities and narratives.”

Grok was the only one out of these three that acknowledged its inability to leave out the recent market performance (ETH is up by 22% monthly, while XRP is down by 13%). It added that ETH has attracted a substantial user and fan base, but XRP's community might be as loud or even louder on social media channels.

Terra/Luna creator Do Kwon pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring to commit fraud and one charge of wire fraud on Tuesday, following an earlier not guilty plea and a very lengthy extradition process.



You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.



Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, who created the TerraUSD  stablecoin and its counterpart Luna (LUNA) token, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities, commodities or wire fraud and wire fraud

Terra and its related ecosystem blew up in spectacular fashion in 2022, with Luna falling from an all-time high price of nearly $120 to less than 10 cents over the course of five weeks. UST broke its peg, and the event was the first domino in the various other crypto company bankruptcies over the course of 2022.

In 2021, Do Kwon repeatedly assured investors that Terra and Luna were safe investments, through tweets and appearances on programs like CoinDesk TV.



On Tuesday, he apologized as part of his guilty plea.



""Between 2018 and 2022 in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, I knowingly agreed with others to engage in a scheme to defraud, and did in fact defraud, purchasers of the cryptocurrencies issued by my company, Terraform Labs,"" he said, going on to say he made ""false and misleading statements"" about why UST regained its peg.



As part of his plea deal, the Department of Justice agreed to recommend a prison sentence of no more than 12 years, and Kwon can apply for an international prison transfer once he's served 50% of his sentence. One of Kwon's attorneys noted that there are still outstanding charges against him in South Korea, the country Kwon tried to get himself extradited to during his extended stay in Montenegro.



Kwon's statement spoke to that: ""The purchasers who I defrauded were in the Republic of Korea, the Southern District of New York and elsewhere,"" he said.

There are certainly real dynamics that make popular ""conspiracy theories"" resonate. The problem is such theories are overly simplistic tripe that play to people's gut feelings. They actually prove way too much, and mainly serve to obscure the real complexity of situations.

When you fry a chip is it obvious because you experience a zap?If so, then that would make all this ""make sure you're grounded"" ceremony less mysterious — because unless you feel a zap (even a tiny one) you probably haven't fried a chip, and it doesn't generally happen in environments where you don't feel zaps.Obvious caveat: ""feeling"" a zap is not a precise measurement.  But perhaps ""zaps fry chips"" is a lie which reveals a greater truth.

But one vital thing to understand is that a lot of those ""vendor recommendations"" exist to cover for rare 1% to 0.1% edge case failures.You can put together 20 PCs, with none of them dying from ESD, and conclude that ESD ""isn't a real issue"". But if you have a company that puts together tens of thousands of PCs per month? Then those ugly 0.1% edge case failures WILL pop up and they WILL cost you. And if you employ enough people, one of them might be a son of Zeus with a wild Wimshurst machine hairstyle - capable of emitting two high power ESDs, complete with an audible crackle and a visible spark, per minute. So ESD straps it is.The same applies to things like humidity control or reflow profiles for electronics. Not an issue ~99% of the time. The remaining ~1% can fuck you over in mass manufacturing, so disrespect the vendor at your own peril.

Eye-catching London ad suggests Wi-Fi is ‘damaging the climate'","https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/is-wi-fi-bad-for-the-environment-eye-catching-london-ad-suggests-our-digital-habits-are-damaging-the-climate","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 16:06:24 GMT","

The ad seemingly says that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment, but its makers just want you to look closer. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A PhD student shared a photograph of an ad for the University of East London, implying that Wi-Fi is detrimental to the environment (h/t vx-underground). The poster says, “WiFi doesn't grow on trees. Your screen time is damaging the climate.” Although it's easy to assume that it's telling us that wireless networking is bad for the environment, a second look at the message focuses more on the time we spend in front of our phones, tablets, smart TVs, and computers, rather than on the Wi-Fi transmission itself.

.@AndyMasley you're desperately needed on the London tube!! pic.twitter.com/femGSAgxv0August 16, 2025

Its initial message was intended to catch the attention of the public, with the ad showing a link to the organization's ‘Think Again' campaign that challenges the status quo. If you visit that page, you'll see that one of the topics covered there is society's use of social media and how it's pushing data centers across the globe to produce more emissions than those generated by the global airline industry. It goes on to show how the University is driving research to make data centers more sustainable, reducing the negative impact of our use of social media on the environment.

The poster doesn't really say that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment — it only tells you that it doesn't grow on trees. University of East London's ad did gather the interest of the people who saw it, especially as it seemingly contradicted something that most of us know as fact — that Wi-Fi is safe. It's quite effective, too. However, this ad can be easily misunderstood by some people, especially conspiracy theorists who think wireless technology is dangerous (like 5G) and are encouraging everyone to start wearing tin foil hats.

Nevertheless, we did see some hilarious responses to vx-underground's post, including users who were thinking about how it would be possible to use a router to cause actual harm to the environment by building a massive router that puts out high-energy microwaves. There are also a few who wanted to determine the actual energy consumption of every Wi-Fi device plugged into the outlet across the U.K., and some who are pondering the actual physical weight of the data transmitted across the waves.

A Medical University of South Carolina team reports in Frontiers in Immunology that it has engineered a new type of genetically modified immune cell that can precisely target and neutralize antibody-producing cells complicit in organ rejection. Similar strategies have been used to stimulate the immune system against certain cancers, but Ferreira's team is the first to show its utility in tamping down immune responses that can lead to organ rejection.

More than 50,000 organ transplants take place each year in the U.S. While often lifesaving, these procedures depend on a precise match between donor and recipient genes to avoid rejection. When the immune system detects foreign tissue, it can attack the transplanted organ.

For decades, doctors have used immunosuppressant drugs to lower the risk of rejection. But these drugs work broadly, suppressing the entire immune system. This can lead to side effects and shorten the life of the transplanted organ.

The MUSC team, led by Leonardo Ferreira, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Pharmacology and Immunology, showed the feasibility of targeted immunosuppression after transplant that could one day reduce rejection without leaving patients vulnerable to infection and other side effects. This strategy could also level the playing field for patients who have limited eligibility for organs because they are especially prone to rejection.

Jaime Valentín-Quiroga, first author of the article and a Ph.D. candidate at University Hospital La Paz in Madrid, Spain, working in the lab of Eduardo Lopez Collazo, Ph.D., is also co-advised by Ferreira. López-Collazo's research team provided the patient samples for the study.

Spain is one of the leading countries worldwide in organ transplantation and offers the perfect platform to move from bench to bedside. I am lucky to be co-advised by Dr. Ferreira. His research combines my favorite topics, fine-tuning the immune system and using cutting-edge biotechnology to enhance immune cells' natural functions.""

Jaime Valentín-Quiroga, first author of the article

When in working balance, the immune system protects the body against outside invaders without attacking its own tissues. B-cells release antibodies that attack pathogens and infected cells. Regulatory T-cells, or Tregs, keep the immune response from going too far, preventing tissue damage and autoimmune diseases.

""When you prick your finger, it is important to mount a strong immune response to kill all the bacteria that entered your finger,"" Ferreira said. ""But it's also important to bring that immune response to a halt when all the bacteria have been killed. Otherwise, you could lose your finger in the process, and the cure would be as bad as the disease.""

A key target for B-cells are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins, which help the immune system to tell self from non-self. Doctors try to match donor and recipient HLA proteins as closely as possible, but with more than 40,000 HLA variants, perfect matches are rare.

One variant, HLA-A2, is found in nearly one-third of the global population. Patients who have had previous exposure to HLA-A2 are considered ""pre-sensitized,"" meaning their immune systems are primed to respond to it and release very large amounts of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies. These include previous transplant patients; women who, during pregnancy, carried a child with HLA-A2 inherited from their partners; and recipients of HLA-A2-positive blood transfusions. Pre-sensitized patients have a much more difficult time finding a compatible donor organ.

Ferreira's team has developed a novel way for the Tregs to find and neutralize specifically the B-cells producing anti-HLA-A2 antibodies. They have fitted the Tregs with a CHAR – short for chimeric anti-HLA antibody receptor – which detects the appropriate B-cells and alerts the Tregs to suppress them. When CHARs detect and attach to B-cells secreting anti-HLA-A2 antibodies, they alert the Tregs to neutralize these problematic B-cells, essentially signaling the immune system to stand down and not attack the organ. In this way, not only do CHARs act like heat-seeking missiles to find the right B-cells to target, but they also hold the key to the Treg's ignition, activating its machinery to elicit a more precise immunosuppressive response and prevent it from going overboard.

Ferreira's team tested the efficacy of CHAR-Tregs in cells from dialysis patients with a history of kidney rejection. The cells showed high levels of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies, but exposure to CHAR-Tregs dramatically decreased antibody levels.

""We took patients' cells that have been shown to make an extremely strong response against HLA-A2-expressing cells, and we showed that the novel CHAR-Tregs calmed them down,"" said Ferreira. ""I think that's the most exciting part of our study – we show that this strategy works in the cells of actual pre-sensitized patients.""

Enzo Maresca does believe the FIFA Club World Cup and a shorter pre-season campaign was to blame for Chelsea's goalless draw with Crystal Palace in their Premier League opener.

Chelsea opened the campaign with a stalemate against their London rivals on Sunday. The Blues failed to break down Palace, as new signings Joao Pedro and Jamie Gittens failed to fire in attack.

Maresca's side were also spared after Eberechi Eze scored a fantastic free-kick for Palace, only for VAR to disallow the effort for Marc Guehi's infringement of the Chelsea wall.

Chelsea mustered just three shots on target but Maresca feels his team deserved the win. He said he was confident Chelsea would improve and refused to blame their unusual pre-season preparations.

“We always try to win the game. Unfortunately, we didn't win but overall we deserved [to],” he told the club's official website.

“We created enough chances in the first half and the second half. Apart from the free-kick, we didn't concede any [clear-cut] chances.

“But at the same time, we know how tough they are, how well organised they are, and that is why in the last two finals they have beaten Liverpool and Manchester City.”

Asked whether Chelsea's Club World Cup-impacted pre-season impacted their performance, Maresca added:” I don't think so, because until the end we competed and we tried to win the game. We had some chances at the end with Estevao and Andrey Santos, so that showed that we competed overall quite well.

“For sure, they played seven or eight games and we played two games last weekend where we shared the minutes, so for sure this was the first real game today but for sure slowly slowly we are going to be better.”

Chelsea's much-anticipated return to Premier League action ended in frustration on Sunday as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, despite the celebratory atmosphere that welcomed the “Champions of the World” back home.

A huge banner honouring the club's recent FIFA Club World Cup triumph was unveiled in The Shed End before kick-off, but the mood quickly shifted as Chelsea struggled to break down a resilient Palace side.

The visitors thought they had taken the lead in the 13th minute when Eberechi Eze's thunderous free-kick flew past Djordje Petrović, only for the goal to be chalked off due to an infringement in the defensive wall.

For Chelsea, big-money summer signings João Pedro and Jamie Gittens failed to make a significant impact on their league debuts. Instead, it was 19-year-old academy graduate Josh Acheampong, starting in central defence, who impressed with a composed performance under pressure.

The Blues, who dismantled Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final last month and followed up with pre-season wins over Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan, were unable to reproduce that attacking fluency against Palace.

The home fans' chants of “We've won it all” gradually faded as frustration mounted with every missed opportunity.

One bright spark was Brazilian teenager Estevão, who injected pace and urgency after coming off the bench in the 54th minute.

The winger came closest to snatching victory late on when he met a Marc Cucurella cross, only to blaze his shot over the bar from close range.

Head coach Enzo Maresca will take positives from the resilience of his youthful side but knows his team must rediscover their cutting edge quickly if they are to mount a serious challenge in the league this season.

As of August 2025, 210 countries feature in the FIFA men's rankings - with East African nation Eritrea unranked as they have not played a competitive match in the last four years.

It has been claimed that their governing body often take the decision to postpone games to avoid players trying escape from the country and request political asylum when playing away games.

Eritrea are not banned from competing as they are still eligible to do so. However, 17 countries have been suspended from football - including one who remain unable to play in competitive fixtures.

Having hosted the 2018 World Cup won by France, Russia were banned by FIFA and UEFA in May 2022 - following on from the invasion of Ukraine and a plethora of European associations refusing to play them.

They were banned from the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024 as well as qualification for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Advert

In recent times Russia have played Belarus, Nigeria, Zambia and Grenada in unofficial friendly fixtures and Donald Trump has hinted at Russia returning.

At the first meeting of his administration's 2026 World Cup task force, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he hopes ""peace will happen and Russia can be readmitted - which prompted the US president to reply, ""That could be a good incentive, right? We want them to stop.""

Fellow World Cup hosts South Africa were banned during the period of racial apartheid. It was lifted in 1963 following a visit from then-FIFA President Stanley Rous but his successor Joao Havelange expelled them in 1976.

Advert

The suspension was lifted properly in 1991 when apartheid was nearing its end and they won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996.

For different reasons, Mexico were banned from two tournaments because they fielded four overage players during a qualifying round for a world junior tournament.

Having been the hosts in 1986, four years later they were not allowed to complete at the showpiece in Italy, where West Germany went all the way.

In easily the most bizarre reason for a World Cup ban, goalkeeper Roberto Rojas used a hidden blade in his glove to cut himself in a qualifier against Brazil - and pretended he had been injured by a flare thrown by a fan.

Advert

His actions led to him being banned for life and his country suffered too as they were not allowed to compete at the 1994 World Cup.

In the 1950 World Cup, the first since 1938, Germany and Japan were barred due to their actions during World War II. Many years later, both went on to successfully host the tournament four years apart.

Pakistan were first suspended by FIFA when its federation's offices came under the control of an administrator, who had been put in place by a court in a move which breached FIFA's third-party rules.

Advert

A second suspension came in 2021 when a ""hostile takeover"" of the Pakistan Football Federation took place and then the hat-trick was completed when the association had failed to adopt a constitution approved by FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation amid governance issues.

It was lifted in March after the PFF agreed to comply.

In a similar timeframe, Congo were suspended in February following government interference. They were readmitted after FIFA were satisfied that the requested conditions were met.

Alexander Zverev played the semifinal of the 'Cincinnati Open' against Carlos Alcaraz, but it was clear to everyone that he was not at the top of his shape due to a malaise already suffered during his match against Ben Shelton in the quarterfinals.

The German ace was unable to recover all his energies in 24 hours, but chose not to retire out of respect for the crowd and the tournament organizers. The champion from Hamburg unleashed a performance very far from expectations and was defeated in two sets by the world number 2, who dedicated a very nice thought to him at the end of the clash and wished him the best for the future.

Admiration for these 2 Top athletes !  Zverev doesn't retire till end, barely standing up, almost fainting on the bench..  Alcaraz emphasizes on Sascha's health, their friendship, not his win ..  Credit 🎥 to @TennisTV IG's post@AlexZverev @carlosalcaraz @Fans4AlexZverev pic.twitter.com/emuqzY3AfW

Sascha's next goal is the US Open, which will be staged in New York from August 24 to September 7, but we will have to see the evolution of his condition in the coming days. The former world No.2 reached his first major final at Flushing Meadows in 2020, when he was defeated by Austrian star Dominic Thiem in a tense match.

Theoretically, Alexander should also participate in the mixed doubles tournament in New York together with Belinda Bencic. This event will be staged during 'Fan Week' – more precisely on August 19 and 20 – but it would not be a surprise if the German changed his plans and skipped the mixed doubles to recharge his batteries for the singles.

Fans and insiders appreciated the fact that Zverev fought until the last point against Carlitos, despite his condition worsening from the beginning of the second set and he even struggled to walk at one point.

He reached the semifinals in both Toronto and Cincinnati, two good results, but the feeling is that he needs some more time to find his best version. It will be interesting to watch his level at the US Open, where he will try to finally break the curse.

There's a riveting sideshow that happens on the courts of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center during the US Open in Queens each year — and it has nothing to do with the famous players vying for the crown.

The event's quick-footed and eager “Ball Crew” regularly enthrall the crowds as they zip across the facility's famous blue arenas between every serve and volley to scoop up balls discarded by the likes of Naomi Osaka and Carlos Alcaraz.

There are 315 members of the agile work crew, and they range in age from 14 to their early 50s, according to team leader Neal Kitson.

Each person is put through a rigorous try-out that tests their agility and speed for grabbing balls off the court in the middle of game play.

This year, there were only 80 spots for newbies open. Out of 1,600 applicants, just 500 were invited to try out — and 420 were sent home. 

At 14 years old, Jayden Wong is among the youngest ball kids serving the iconic tennis tournament this summer.

“It definitely feels a little bit pressuring, but I like knowing that the older kids are watching over me,” said Jayden of Bayside, Queens.

“They have high expectations, but it's definitely not too hard on me — just knowing that we're all a team and that we're all just here to help each other out,” he said.

The ball boy said he was “surprised” earlier this summer when he learned he had been plucked from a pool of thousands of applicants to serve as a ball kid — a dream he'd had for as long as he could remember.

His deep-rooted passion for tennis sprouted when he first picked up a racket at age 6 to connect with his four older brothers, who were enamored with the game.

By age 10, Jayden was logging practices five days a week with the New York Junior Tennis League, and his family was capping off every summer with a trip to the US Open qualifying round.

“I would just go down there, see how fluid everything was and how everyone was together. And I thought to myself, I was like, ‘You know, one day I want to be down there. I want to be just like them,' ” Jayden said.

“I really felt that I had that ability just to play with them. And I had the skills to be in front of the top tennis players. I'm just really excited that I got selected.”

Akari Weintzen's first year as a ball girl was when Italy's Jannik Sinner took home the top men's trophy last year at the facility's centerpiece arena, Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Akari, 17, had originally requested off that day to prepare for her upcoming SATs — until Kitson called her and specifically asked her to work.

“Obviously I skipped SAT prep!” said Akari of Murray Hill in Manhattan.

“I couldn't believe that I was able to do that match. And it's what I'm most proud of in my whole life — to be able to say that I worked the men's finals is really cool.”

Akari herself first picked up a racket at 6 years old during an after-school program — and it was love at first swing.

She now plays for Junior Tennis, as well as her varsity team at Bronx Science High School.

For Olivia Chen, her four years on the Ball Crew have brought valuable life lessons along with lifelong friendships.

For her second year in 2023, Olivia, 18, was honored to serve as a member of the all-female Ball Crew on the court when fellow teenager Coco Gauff smashed her way into the history books.

“The whole year's theme was to honor Billie Jean King and her fight for equal prize money in tennis. I was chosen to be part of the all-female ball crew for the women's finals championship and, wow, it was just so empowering,” said Chen of Bayside.

“Billie Jean King came up to talk to us after the match had ended, and she explained to us what it was all for, and just getting to see so many confident females on court, getting to be on court with them too, it was just so empowering. It was amazing.”

The moment was a dream come true for Chen, whose parents had been taking her to the stadium since she was an infant.

While the US Open lasts three weeks every year — which some extra days tacked on for Ball Crew training — Chen emphasized that she leaves every tournament with a trove of memories and new friends from across the globe.

“It's just an incredible team. The sense of camaraderie is really there,” she said. “Our culture motto is: One team, one dream, and it's really something that we live by. 

“I know that if I look at anyone on the crew, they'll have my back on or off the court and I feel that same responsibility towards them. And it's just a blast. Ball Crew is so special.”

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

With Alpine currently last in the 2025 Teams' Standings, we sum up their season so far in their half term report.

Alpine have had an eventful season so far – again. After something of a rollercoaster 2024 campaign, they went into this year with a pairing of Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan, only for the rookie Australian to find himself back on the sidelines after the team opted for the services of Franco Colapinto from Imola onwards. However, amid another Team Principal departure, the underlying facts are that Alpine's car isn't quite fast enough this season, leaving the Enstone-based outfit sitting bottom of the Teams' Standings. Here's the lowdown on their 2025 so far…

Pierre Gasly – 6th in Great Britain

Gasly perfectly described his sixth-placed finish at the British Grand Prix as ‘unreal' – given the Alpine driver had started the Silverstone weekend with P19, P18 and P20 finishes in the first three practice sessions.

Having impressively hauled his car into the top 10 in Saturday's Qualifying, the subsequent wet-dry race on Sunday brought chaos – and opportunity – for those up and down the grid. While Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg stole the show with his rise to the podium that day, Gasly's own efforts in maximizing what was on offer shouldn't be ignored.

He expertly held onto his top-10 start for much of the race before eventually picking off the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll on the final lap of the Grand Prix to score Alpine's best result of the season so far, as well as eight very valuable points.

Gasly 5-1 Doohan
Gasly 6-2 Colapinto

Doohan spent the opening six rounds of the season alongside Gasly, but it was the more experienced Frenchman who led in the Qualifying head-to-head statistics. The only event where the Australian came out on top in Qualifying was in Miami – as he made it to Q2 before securing 14th on the grid after Gasly was knocked out in the first phase.

However, Doohan's race on the Sunday would last less than a lap after he and Liam Lawson made contact at the first corner – and for the next round in Imola he was dropped back down to reserve with Colapinto taking his place.

With the Argentine now having had eight race weekends of his own alongside Gasly, it is still the Frenchman who leads the way — though Colapinto showed pace in Canada and Hungary.

Gasly 4*-1 Doohan
Gasly 5-3 Colapinto

When it comes to the race head-to-head, Gasly again comes out on top compared to his less experienced team mates at Alpine — while his disqualification from the Chinese Grand Prix sees him lose out on a score against Doohan.

The Frenchman is also responsible for scoring all of the team's points thus far – with neither Doohan or Colapinto able to finish in the points-scoring positions in 2025. Currently Colapinto's highest finish is 13th in both Monaco and Canada, while Doohan's highest was also 13th, achieved in China (though this was aided by three post-race disqualifications.)

Gasly's 20 points for Alpine do, however, make them the highest scoring last-placed team in F1 history, so there's something to shout about.

*Gasly was disqualified from the Chinese Grand Prix for an underweight car

There haven't been too many contenders for this section in 2025, so Gasly's remarkable sixth in the British Grand Prix gets another mention here.

Given the Frenchman has openly admitted the car is relatively slow compared to the opposition, and that much of the squad's focus is on 2026 and the new set of regulations, then there probably won't be too many more results like this for the rest of the year.

Mind you, we said similar this time last season before Gasly and Esteban Ocon went on to secure a double podium in Brazil…

There's been plenty of off-track news surrounding Alpine again this year – not only was there the aforementioned driver swap with Doohan and Colapinto but Team Principal Oli Oakes also exited the squad earlier this year due to reasons of a ""personal nature"".

But for Alpine's worst moment of 2025 we're going to nominate Gasly's disqualification in China. It went under the radar at the time – given Ferrari's duo of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were both also disqualified from the race – but being excluded from a Grand Prix is never something you want on your record.

Much of Alpine's focus is lasered in on 2026 and the new regulations, but the arrival of Steve Nielsen on September 1 as Managing Director will be a significant step in solidifying the team's leadership structure.

Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore has been covering many of the duties previously performed by Oakes, with Nielsen being recruited to oversee the day-to-day running of the team. The Briton also has previous experience with the Enstone-based squad having worked with them under their previous guises as Benetton, Renault and Lotus.

As highlighted by Gasly, much of Nielsen's focus will be on maximising what's possible in 2026 to ensure the team are performing to the best of their abilities. Quite simply, last in the Teams' Standings is not where they expect to be.

But away from 2026, there also needs to be a focus on helping guide Colapinto through a challenging phase in his F1 career. The Argentine showed what he was capable of last season with Williams, but he is yet to hit those heights in an Alpine.

If they can get him firing on all cylinders alongside Gasly then the prospects look brighter for the future, as well as their hopes for finishing a little further up the standings.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

As we reach the halfway point of the season, it's time to look back on how Haas' campaign has unfolded so far with their new-for-2025 line-up of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman.

After a respectable P7 finish in 2024, Haas currently hold ninth place in the Teams' Championship at the midway point of 2025, a season in which the team have fielded an all-new line-up in Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman. Amid a tight midfield battle, can the American outfit find more consistency during the remainder of the campaign? Let's take a look at their half term report…

Esteban Ocon – 5th in China

Following a challenging weekend at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix – in which the team qualified at the back of the grid – Haas bounced back in style one week later in China, with the squad scoring their first double points result of the year.

Ocon and Bearman initially crossed the line in seventh and 10th respectively but were later promoted by two positions each following the disqualifications of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, handing them a P5 and a P8.

While other points finishes have followed, the squad have yet to match that fifth place achieved by Ocon, having struggled to find a consistent level of performance during the first half of the season.

Ocon 8-6 Bearman

The more experienced Ocon has beaten his rookie team mate in Qualifying on eight occasions, which included a season-best P8 on the grid at Monaco.

This position was initially matched by Bearman at Silverstone, but a 10-place penalty for an FP3 red flag infringement dropped the Briton down to P18, a punishment that he also received during the Monaco weekend.

Ocon 9-5 Bearman

Ocon has also just had the edge over Bearman in race trim, the Frenchman crossing the line ahead at nine Grands Prix. Bearman, however, faced slightly worse luck in terms of retirements, having twice recorded a DNF owing to a mechanical issue in comparison to only one non-finish for Ocon.

Of the team's current total of 35 points, Ocon is responsible for 27, putting him in 10th place of the Drivers' Standings, while Bearman has scored eight points in 19th place.

That aforementioned double points haul in Shanghai was a promising moment for the team, with it highlighting that there was not only pace to unlock in the VF-25 but that they could also master solid strategy calls, after an alternate plan for Bearman saw him climb up from P17 on the grid.

Given the troubles of Australia, Ocon hailed the outcome one week on as an “amazing turnaround”, while Bearman admitted that he felt “really proud” of the team for taking such a step forwards.

Other highlights during the season included further double points finishes, including at Round 4 in Bahrain as well as in the Sprint at the Belgian Grand Prix more recently.

Haas experienced a tricky run of point-less races between Saudi Arabia and Imola, while the squad also endured a challenging moment in the British Grand Prix when Ocon and Bearman collided, on a day where Ocon felt that both drivers “deserved to be in the points”.

But perhaps their toughest moment of all was facing such a nightmarish start straight out of the blocks in Australia, with Bearman acknowledging that not being in the fight for points had come as an “unwelcome surprise”.

It had also proved to be a shock to Team Principal Ayao Komatsu, who later conceded that he “felt sick” at how far off the pace the car was, leading to a concerted effort to fix the issue as quickly as possible.

While there have been positive moments for Haas, their form has been somewhat unpredictable from one weekend to the next – and, given how fine the margins are in the midfield, developing more consistency will be a key aim going forwards if they are to make gains from P9.

As Ocon summarised ahead of the summer break: “Looking at this first half, I think there are some positives, definitely. We've scored a decent amount of points, but we are not consistent enough and where we want to be every single time. We'll give it everything for the next half.

“If you look at Spa, we had mega performance, it was a great weekend. We are not there every single weekend, and this is where we need to get the consistency together. We are working on that. I have full trust behind the team and it's far from over this season.”

Komatsu has stated that the team's long-term goal is to reach the podium, which would suggest that – in the short-term – they will be hoping to move nearer to the head of the midfield and take further steps towards realising that ambition.

The actor earned an Oscar nom for his first film, 'Billy Budd,' was menacing in 'Superman,' 'The Limey' and 'The Collector' and romanced Julie Christie on and off the screen.


							By 

	Rhett Bartlett



	Terence Stamp, the strikingly handsome British actor who embodied the swinging sixties and whose versatility shone in Billy Budd, Superman and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, died Sunday, his family told The New York Times. He was 87.


	They did not specify where he died or the cause, the newspaper said.




	Stamp won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for his terrifying performance as a psycho who holds a young woman (Samantha Eggar) hostage in William Wyler's The Collector (1965), then experienced a resurgence when he played the Kryptonian megalomaniac General Zod in Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980).

	











	Stamp had supporting roles in Legal Eagles (1986) and Wall Street (1988), then received critical praise for portraying a veteran English crook in the Steven Soderbergh crime drama The Limey (1999). Also that year, he gained Star Wars immortality by playing Chancellor Valorum in The Phantom Menace.


	In his youth, the blue-eyed Stamp was widely considered one of the most handsome men onscreen, and Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini used that to peculiar effect in Teorema (1968), casting the actor as a nameless and wordless visitor who seduces an entire household. Pasolini made sure to include several close-up shots of Stamp's crotch in the film.


	As the cavalry sergeant in Far From the Madding Crowd (1967), he received equal top billing with Julie Christie despite the fact that Peter Finch and Alan Bates also played characters who romanced her flirtatious Bathsheba. “That was my mum's favorite movie of mine,” he once said. “She always thought I looked better [in it] than I looked in anything else.”

	











	The feature includes a memorable whirling montage of Stamp, who was naturally left-handed, showing off his swordsmanship to woo Christie on a hillside. Director John Schlesinger insisted that all cavalry men before 1860 were right-handed, and so Stamp obliged.


	Offscreen, he romanced Christie, and he claimed both were name-dropped in The Kinks' 1967 hit song “Waterloo Sunset” — “Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station, every Friday night” — though the band's frontman, Ray Davies, denied that in his autobiography.


	Stamp also dated English supermodel Jean Shrimpton, and when that relationship ended, he began a round-the-world trip to make sense of it all, stopping first in Egypt and winding up in Bombay. It was there that he received a telegram addressed to “Clarence Stamp,” inviting him to meet Superman director Richard Donner for a chance to star opposite Marlon Brando.


	“Two actors of my generations were Brando and [James] Dean,” he told interviewer Michael Parkinson in 1988. “They were the two idols. Dean was no longer with us and Brando was still around, so the idea of getting up on film with him, albeit brief, was irresistible.”


	However, working alongside the two-time Oscar winner was disappointing, he said. Brando, playing Superman's father, Jor-El, didn't bother to learn his lines, having his dialogue written in a large font on posters placed behind the set lights. “How are you going to play King Lear and Macbeth if you can't learn a line?” Stamp asked. “I've learned them already,” was Brando's dismissive retort.

	










Terence Stamp in his first film, ‘Billy Budd.'


	Stamp, then 24, received a supporting actor Oscar nomination in 1963 for his screen debut as the angelic and optimistic HMS Avenger crewman Billy Budd. His captain was played by Peter Ustinov, who directed, co-wrote and produced the film.


	Stamp's confidence in the screen test was shattered when he spied Ustinov looking out over the rooftops as he waited for him. “He was so powerful that everything that I said seemed very thin. And I just stopped speaking,” he said. Ustinov hired him, though, as Stamp had unwittingly replicated Billy Budd's gormless behavior.


	“This is Terence Stamp” the film's trailer screams, “the young actor hailed by famed columnist Louella Parsons as the screen's outstanding new star discovery.”


	He received the most promising newcomer (male) award at the Golden Globes, and the film was voted one of the year's 10 best by the National Board of Review.


	In a career spanning six decades, perhaps his most challenging performance came after he was offered the role of Bernadette, a transgender woman who embarks on an Australian road trip with two drag queens, in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994).


	“I thought it was a joke, but a woman friend of mine just happened to be present when I was getting calls from my agent about the script, and she pointed out to me in a very incisive way that my fear was out of all proportion to the possible consequences,” he told the British Film Institute.

	











	“But it wasn't a fun thing, or anything I was looking forward to. It was, ‘Fuck me, this is the last thing in the world I want to do: be in fucking Australia with paparazzi.' It was like a nightmare. But it was only when I got there, and got through the fear, that it became one of the great experiences of my whole career. It was probably the most fun thing I've ever done.”


	The film grossed more than $16 million at the Australian box office, screened at Cannes and won the Oscar for best costume design.


	“At the beginning of the film, we're distracted by the unexpected sight of Terence Stamp in drag,” Roger Ebert wrote, “but Stamp is able to bring a convincing humanity to the character.”


	Stamp was born on July 22, 1938, in Stepney, London, the oldest of five children. His father was a tugboat captain who was often away for long stretches.


	He won a scholarship to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and later shared a house in London with Michael Caine as the two began their movie careers. When Stamp turned down the film lead in Alfie despite playing the role on Broadway in 1964, Caine snapped it up. (The British acting legends acted on stage in The Long and the Short and the Tall yet never appeared together in a movie.)


	Stamp's spark for acting began, he said, when he saw Beau Geste (1939) in a movie theater.


	“The empathy I felt from Gary Cooper was life-changing, and a secret dream was born in the darkened auditorium,” he wrote in his 2017 memoir, The Ocean Fell Into the Drop.












	His earlier memoirs were 1987's Stamp Album, 1988's Coming Attractions, 1989's Double Feature and 2011's Rare Stamps: Reflections on Living, Breathing and Acting. He wrote the 1993 fiction novel The Night and in 2001 co-authored with Elizabeth Buxton a healthy eating manual for those who are wheat and lactose-intolerant called The Stamp Collection Cookbook.


	His other films included the spy comedy Modesty Blaise (1966); Ken Loach‘s 1967 debut, Poor Cow; Frank Oz's Bowfinger (1999); and Bryan Singer‘s Valkyrie (2008). More recently, he appeared in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016), Viking Destiny (2018), Murder Mystery (2019) and Edgar Wright's Last Night in Soho (2021).


	For television, Stamp hosted the first season of the horror anthology series The Hunger, re-entered the Superman world by voicing Jor-El on Smallville and tried to solve the crime at the center of the 2017 Agatha Christie adaptation Crooked House.


	On New Year's Eve in 2002, Stamp, then 64, married 29-year-old pharmacologist Elizabeth O'Rourke, whom he had met in Bondi, Australia. They divorced in 2008.


	His late brother, Chris Stamp, was a co-manager and producer for The Who in the band's earlier days.


	In the DVD extras of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Stamp — in character as Bernadette — is asked, “Why is Terence Stamp so attractive?”


	“Well, he possesses the three things that any woman would want,” he says. “He's funny, he's romantic, and he has wisdom.”

	Although The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is coming to an unceremonious end, Conan O'Brien is confident its host isn't going anywhere.


	While speaking Saturday at his induction into the Television Academy Hall of Fame, the 5x Emmy-winning comedian praised Colbert as “too talented and too essential” and shared his thoughts on the future of late-night television.


	“Yes, late-night television as we have known it since around 1950 is going to disappear. But those voices are not going anywhere,” said O'Brien. “People like Stephen Colbert are too talented and too essential to go away. It's not gonna happen.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Meanwhile, Paramount is under fire for canceling The Late Show on the heels of the company's $16M settlement with Trump, which has been scrutinized as potential bribery by some lawmakers. Following Colbert's ongoing jokes at the president's expense, Trump has celebrated the talk show's demise.


	George Cheeks, CBS‘s Chair of TV Media, has since claimed that the talk show's “economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.” Jeff Shell, president of Paramount under its new Skydance acquisition, has shown his support for the decision, explaining, “Late-night has a huge problem right now. … You can't make it work economically anymore.”


	Going scorched-earth on CBS ahead of his May 2026 departure, Colbert recently kicked off the job search while signing off for summer hiatus from The Late Show. “Netflix, call me I'm available in June,” he said last weekend on the show. “I will also entertain offers from Amazon.”

	Scottish filmmaker Kevin Macdonald shared an intriguing behind-the-scenes anecdote about the production of his 2009 fiction feature State Of Play this afternoon at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where he gave a keynote Q&A session alongside his brother, producer Andrew Macdonald. 


	In the session, chaired by Edinburgh TV Festival head Rowan Woods, Kevin was asked about his filmmaking forays in Hollywood, when he zeroed in on State of Play. 


	“I didn't realize at the time, but looking back, that was a pivotal film in Hollywood, as well as for me, because it was sort of the end [of an era],” Kevin said of the film, which starred an A-list cast including Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck.

	“Donna Langley mentioned it too when she did Desert Island Discs. It was a turning point movie for her at Universal and the rest of Hollywood because it was conceived as an all-star, intelligent thriller for adults at $100 million. Can you imagine that today?” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Kevin continued to say that the film was originally seen by its studio, Universal, as a star vehicle for Brad Pitt, and he was tasked with tightening up the film's screenplay and went looking for a writer to collaborate with to complete the job. 


	“I got Tony Gilroy, who was very hot off the back of doing the Bourne films and many other great films,” Kevin said. “We spent two months in his apartment, rewriting the script, spending untold amounts of money, and then showed it to Brad Pitt, and he hated it.” 


	Kevin added, “That was just the beginning of a long and very Hollywood-y saga, which I'm glad I had. It was the tail end of a certain kind of wasteful Hollywood filmmaking.” 


	Pitt was later replaced by Crowe. The film's starry ensemble also features Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright, Jason Bateman, Jeff Daniels, and Helen Mirren. The film tells the story of Cal McAffrey, a fictional journalist, and his probe into the suspicious death of the assistant and mistress of a Congressman. 

	











	Kevin added that the entire film was shot on a sound stage in Hollywood. 


	“We knocked down the wall between two huge sound stages,” he said. “We had to build a big enough set for an office, even though we could have just gone to Washington, D.C.. But because Brad had a young family at the time and didn't want to travel, we built this set that in the end he didn't end up being able to use.”


	This afternoon's session between Kevin and Andrew was the centerpiece of this year's Industry section at Edinburgh. Andrew is the Chair of the festival, and before the session, the pair screened one of their early shorts, which was shot on site at Edinburgh in the early 90s. 


	The short features the brothers attempting to sell the screenplay for Shallow Grave to a producer. They are unsuccessful in raising funds for the film, but Andrew explained that the short helped to launch their careers. 


	“It screened on the last day of the festival in '92,” he said. “From that, we met this amazing woman who was the commissioning editor at Scottish television called Maxine Baker, and she then commissioned us to make a series called Shadowing.”


	He later added: “And when we were making this TV show Shadowing in Edinburgh, we got the script [for Shallow Grave] to somebody at Channel Four.”


Shallow Grave was eventually directed by Danny Boyle, marking his first collaboration with Andrew. The pair went on to make Trainspotting and several other features, including The Beach.


	This year's Edinburgh Film Festival ends on August 20.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Terence Stamp, British actor behind Superman's General Zod","https://www.avclub.com/rip-terence-stamp-obituary-superman-general-zod","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 18:56:07 GMT","

Terence Stamp has died. Known for bringing erudite stateliness and dignity to Superman's General Zod, Stamp's decades-long film career contains far more than comic book villainy. With his piercing stare and ridiculously well-defined cheekbones, Stamp brought a palpable intensity to the screen. Amid his time as London's “It” boy of the Swinging Sixties, he worked with cinema's most revered actors and directors. He also lived on an ashram, published memoirs, and wrote cookbooks for wheat-, dairy-, salt-, and sugar-free diets. Per Reuters, his family confirmed his death Sunday morning. He was 87.

“He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,” the family said in a statement. “We ask for privacy at this sad time.”

Born in London's East End in 1938, Stamp grew up poor during the Blitz, with his father, a tugboat stoker, heading to war. In between shifts as a barmaid, his mother raised Stamp and his four siblings through the London bombings. She also introduced him to acting by taking a 4-year-old Stamp to see Gary Cooper in Beau Geste. He immediately knew he wanted to be an actor. “Who better to mold your life on?” Stamp later said. After working in advertising for several years, Stamp won a scholarship to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where he became roommates with Michael Caine, Stamp's one-time mentor. He made his screen debut in Peter Ustinov's adaptation of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, which earned him an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe. The role catapulted him to stardom, as did his dating life. Stamp became one of the era's most photographed stars while dating Julie Christie and supermodel Jean Shrimpton. He was even considered to succeed Sean Connery as James Bond. Unfortunately, his ideas “put the frighteners” on producers. “I didn't get a second call.”

The '60s saw Stamp reach remarkable creative heights, working opposite cinema's most revered names, including Laurence Olivier and Ken Loach. In William Wyler's The Collector, Stamp played his first unsettlingly calm villain, an archetype he'd return to with masterful variation throughout his career. He traveled to Italy to act for Federico Fellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Still, he learned his greatest lessons working for directors “who don't really like me and never really wanted me.”

“John Schlesinger, when I did Far From The Maddening Crowd, made it very clear that I wasn't his first choice. I was foisted on him by the producer,” Stamp told BFI. “For the first time, I had to work without the cooperation of a director. I discovered a lot about myself. I discovered that, left to my own devices, I could pull something out of the bag.”

After his public breakup with Jean Shrimpton, Stamp moved to India to live in an ashram. He returned broke and landed the most popular role of his career, demanding Earthlings “knee before Zod” as General Zod in Superman and Superman II. Working opposite one of his heroes, Marlon Brando, Stamp brought the ashram's teachings to the set. “I'll play this role as though I'm in the ashram,” he said. “I won't worry about being evil or what I say or what I do. I'll bring this kind of all-enveloping presence to it.” The result was a high-water mark for the genre.



Stamp built upon his Superman success with a diversity of roles. He starred as a transgender woman traveling the Australian outback with two drag queens in The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. It was a groundbreaking role. “My characterization was based on how it would feel to be born into the wrong body,” he told The A.V. Club in 2013. “My feeling was, this was always a woman, she'd always only been a woman. But the truth is, the more I became familiar with the movie, I realized that it kind of is a masterpiece, really. It's so silly that people don't take it seriously, and it's kind of a perfect movie. Flawless.”

Five years later, he played Steven Soderbergh's seething career criminal on the hunt in The Limey. In addition to Limey, he was a fixture of the 1999 box office, appearing in Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace and Bowfinger. During this time, he met his first and only wife, Elizabeth O'Rourke, who was 33 years his junior. The couple published two cookbooks, based on his various dietary allergies, and divorced in 2008.

Stamp continued working throughout the 2000s. He returned to Kypton, playing Jor-El on Smallville, and appeared in Tim Burton's Big Eyes. His career remained varied, starring in the 2019 Adam Sandler comedy, Murder Mystery, and HBO's His Dark Materials. Appropriately, he returned to Mod London for 2021's Last Night In Soho, playing the type of brooding baddie that made him a star.

Contrary to popular belief, longtime HGTV stars Erin and Ben Napier can't actually save the world — despite many of their fans hoping they will. 

The couple's list of talents and achievements seems never-ending, from inspiring small town transformations across North America to launching a movement to raise children without access to social media. But on August 16, 2025, Erin inadvertently ruffled some feathers with an “inconsequential” Instagram post about her and Ben's date night.

Noting that they had “had dinner and a good state of the union,” Erin received lots of pushback from followers who thought she meant they'd been happily discussing how America is doing, rather than the state of their union as a couple — a popular strategy developed by The Gottman Institute for married couples to discuss their relationship weekly. 

Erin told one fan that anyone who misunderstood her post should “unfollow me immediately.” And when another fan insinuated that Erin and Ben were not doing enough to influence positive change in the United States, Erin was quick to respond with a hilarious bit of sass, sarcastically vowing to go “fix everything.”

A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)

Erin posted a photo on August 16 of Ben on their date night, looking relaxed in a floral shirt at an outdoor dining spot, and she wrote, “grandparents had the girls so we had dinner and a good state of the union. and a little sunburn. also, can non strategic and inconsequential instagram posts make a comeback?”

“Not while your countries on fire,” responded one follower in a since-deleted comment reviewed by EntertainmentNow. “Sticking your head in the sand isn't going to make it go away and Southerners need to take their share of responsibility for this mess.” 

Within minutes, Erin replied to that follower — who signed the comment from a “concerned” Canadian, including the Canadian flag emoji — with a sarcastic quip that's also since been deleted. 

Erin wrote, “yeah you're so right. ben and i will fix everything, brb”

Although Erin had been trying to inspire others to share “inconsequential” posts about everyday life, her August 16 post appeared highly consequential to some of her 1.5 million Instagram followers who assumed her “state of the union” comment was politically motivated. Erin not only denied this in her comment section, but urged those who misunderstood her to unfollow her. 

On August 17, one fan wrote, “My hope is you worded your post this way so unhinged people would comment 😂 …. Lovely couple!!! ❤️”

Erin, who has since limited her comments on the post, replied, “anyone who thinks this post has a thing to do with politics needs to unfollow me immediately 😄 seriously though.”

Oscar nominee, character actor extraordinaire, and one of the most multi-faceted actors of his generation, the British star Terence Stamp died on Sunday at the age of 87. The news was first reported by the New York Times, which shared that the actor's family had “confirmed his death but did not specify where he died or the cause.”

Born in July 22, 1938, in London, one of five children of Thomas Stamp and Ethel (Perrott) Stamp, the idea of growing up to become a movie star could not have been further from Stamp's mind or early experience. Initially, young Stamp worked in advertising, but he had long harbored dreams of acting, and trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

His first major role in “Billy Budd” earned him his first and only Oscar nomination, but it also set his career on fire. Early success, including acclaim for his piercing blue eyes and iconic voice, notched him work with everyone from Federico Fellini to Marlon Brando, but his career seemingly fell off as he approached his thirties. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






His casting as General Zod in the first two “Superman” films of the '70s has long been viewed as his great comeback, but over the following decades, he continued to make compelling, often off-beat choices. Those included starring in “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” as a transgender woman with unexpected tenderness and bringing his unique zeal to Steven Soderbergh's “The Limey.” Always wonderful, always unpredictable. 

In 2013, the actor reflected on the ups and downs of his career with IndieWire. At the time, he was returning to the big screen with a lead role in “Unfinished Song.” “I've just grown used to doing roles that are tough guys, and it hasn't really made any difference to my life,” he said. “I guess in the big trajectory of things, I was out of work for most of the ‘70s and I just traveled. I got to the point where I just thought I was never going to get the call. But I did.”

Stamp looked back on the career- and life-changing calls behind his work in the “Superman” films, telling IndieWire, “I got recalled to do the first two ‘Superman' movies, that I think are the very best of all those comic book movies. But during that leave of absence, I guess I changed, like emotionally, I was changed from a leading man to a character actor. In a way it was very painful at the time, but it's proven to be a blessing in disguise. The reason that I've had such a long career is because I'm up for anything. I'm sort of fearless at this point in my life. So even when I did General Zod, can you really imagine Robert Redford or Warren Beatty playing General Zod? I was of a similar ilk.”

 










He continued, “Initially I never really understood why I couldn't get a lead part after '69. My own understanding of it was that I was so identified with the ‘60s period, that when it ended, the word on the street was, ‘Well, we're looking for a young Terence Stamp,' and I was in my thirties. The fundamental change was in Terence. So by the time Zod came up, I was really hungry to work. I guess that's why it became such a landmark role for me. There was nearly eight years of storing up energy being ready to let loose on the set of the ‘Superman' movies.”

He was nominated for two BAFTAs, two Golden Globes, and won Cannes' Best Actor award in 1965 for his work in William Wyler's “The Collector.” He last appeared on-screen in 2021, care of a small but notable role in Edgar Wright's “Last Night in Soho.”

The NYT notes that in “2002, at age 64, he married Elizabeth O'Rourke, a 29-year-old Australian pharmacist; they divorced in 2008.” The NYT reported that “information on survivors was not immediately available.”

Godspeed You! Black Emperor are the latest indie-rockers to pull their music from Spotify. However, the Canadian post-rock band have gone one step further and removed nearly their entire discography from all major streaming services. Pitchfork has reached out to the band's label, Constellation Records, for comment.

Currently, no Godspeed You! Black Emperor records are available to stream on Spotify or Tidal. The band's two albums for Kranky—1998's F# A# ∞ and 2000's Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven—are still up on Apple Music, but a representative for the label confirmed to Pitchfork that they are in the process of being taken down. “Kranky has always granted artists control over how their music is presented and disseminated,” they shared in a statement. Godspeed You! Black Emperor's catalog can still be purchased and streamed via Bandcamp.

Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu, and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have all left Spotify in the last two months. All three groups cited the military investments made by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek through his investment fund Prima Materia. Since 2021, Prima Materia has been investing in Helsing, a defense company that sells software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to inform military decisions.

Last year, Godspeed You! Black Emperor shared the album “No Title As of 13 February 2024 28,340 Dead”, named for what was, at the time, the Palestinian death toll of Israel's war in Gaza as reported by Gaza's Health Ministry.

	Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows food prices have spiked by 2.9 percent since last July, and wholesale prices on fresh and dry vegetables increased by nearly 40 percent last month — the biggest increase in the last three years. And rising prices are likely to continue. Why? Donald Trump‘s tariffs.


	Producers are already seeing rising costs. The Labor Department's producer price index, a measure of inflation on wholesale goods and producer costs, increased by nearly one percentage point from June to July. Wholesale prices are up by 3.3 percent over last July. These numbers were significantly higher than economists predicted.


	The data “points to pipeline inflation that's likely to spill into consumer prices in the months ahead,” Michelle Green, a former Labor Department economist currently working at corporate planning firm Board, told Axios.


	According to the Consumer Price Index, prices for consumers have already risen on several foods. Prices have increased by 5.8 percent on meat, 3.1 percent on poultry, 16.4 percent on eggs, and 14.5 percent on coffee.

	“Keep in mind, certain foods like coffee, cocoa that's used in chocolate, we can't grow these here, so we're going to be faced with higher prices or changing what we drink,” food trends expert Phil Lempert told WPTV West Palm Beach.


	Prices will likely increase on other foods as well. While for now, it seems some companies are eating the cost of tariffs, they won't be able to hold off forever on pushing those rising costs to consumers.

	











	“It will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at financial markets research firm fwdbonds told PBS.


	These rising prices will not just be limited to foods. Home electronic prices, for example, rose 5 percent in July as compared to June. Core consumer prices overall increased from 2.9 percent in June to 3.1 percent in July, far above the Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent.

	Trump has also fired the head of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the Consumer Price Index because he didn't like the July jobs numbers, potentially putting into question future reports by the bureau.


	As wholesale and consumer prices have risen, so has the demand on food banks, which were already hit hard with shortages due to federal budget cuts earlier this year and actions at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” congressional Republicans passed last month also cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by $186 billion, meaning more people may be turning to increasingly strapped food banks to make up for the loss in food assistance.

Terence Stamp, the Oscar-nominated British actor who starred in The Limey, Billy Budd, and as General Zod in Superman, has died at the age of 87.


	Stamp's death was announced Sunday by his family, who said in a statement, “He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and a writer that will continue to touch people for years to come,” the BBC reports. No cause of death was provided.


	The actor's six-decade film career began in 1962 with the titular role in Billy Budd, which earned the then-24-year-old an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Stamp would next star in Sixties films like The Collector, Far From the Maddening Crowd, Modesty Blaise, Poor Cow, Teorama, and the horror anthology Spirits of the Dead.


	In the Seventies, Stamp stepped back from acting to become a swami in India, but he experienced a career resurgence in 1978 when he was cast as the villainous General Zod in the big screen adaptation of Superman; he would reprise the role in the 1980 sequel Superman II. 

	











	Notable films in the decade that followed include supporting roles in Wall Street, The Hit, Young Guns, and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, where Stamp's turn as a transgender woman earned him both a Golden Globe and BAFTA nomination for Best Actor.

	In 1999, Stamp starred in director Steven Soderbergh's nonlinear revenge film The Limey. “I would play this game with Terence, because he literally has no fixed address — but he's seen everything, done everything, lived everywhere,” Soderbergh told Rolling Stone in a 20th anniversary interview about the acclaimed film. “So I'd just turn to him and go, ‘The best necktie shop?' And he'd pause and go, ‘Oh, there's this place in London . . .' I mean, whatever you asked him — the best French restaurant, the best this, the best that — he knew it. He had an answer immediately.

	











	Over the past two decades, Stamp also appeared in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Soderbergh's Full Frontal, Wanted, Get Smart, Tim Burton's Big Eyes, the Adam Sandler comedy Murder Mystery, and his last big screen credit, Edgar Wright's 2021 horror film Last Night in Soho. Stamp would also return to the Superman universe, albeit on the small screen, to portray the hero's father Jor-El on the series Smallville.

            In New Mexico's most populous city, National Guard troops are listening to the police dispatch calls, monitoring traffic cameras and helping to secure crime scene perimeters, tasks not usually part of the job.
    


            The New Mexico National Guard is in Albuquerque to help counter what officials have called a surge in crime, but unlike the recent deployment of troops in military fatigues by the federal government in the nation's capital and earlier in Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement, the state's polo-shirted Guard troops were ordered in by the Democratic governor.
    


            And last week, New Mexico's governor declared a state of emergency in other parts of the state, which gives her the discretion to mobilize more troops.
    


            Here's how a National Guard deployment is playing out in New Mexico and why it matters.
    


            Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's state of emergency order issued for Rio Arriba County, the city of Española and area pueblos, was made at the request of the local governments, she said.
    


            The Albuquerque deployment of 60 to 70 troops came after an emergency request from the city's police department citing the “fentanyl epidemic and rising violent juvenile crime as critical issues requiring immediate intervention.”
    


            The new declaration is aimed at helping local police respond to a “significant surge” in violent crime, drug trafficking and public safety threats that have “overwhelmed local resources.” Rio Arriba County has the highest overdose death rate in the state, the governor's news release said.
    


            The troops are helping police with non-law enforcement duties and are not armed, will not make arrests, detain anyone, use force or engage in any immigration-related activities, the city said.
    


            “We understand there are concerns based on what is taking place in other parts of the country, and we want to assure the public that here in Albuquerque, the Guard's role is clearly defined, and focused on support without enforcement,” Police Chief Harold Medina said in a June news release.
    


August 12, 2025: National Guard appears in DC after Trump surges federal authorities



            CNN has contacted the Albuquerque Police Department and the New Mexico National Guard about whether the deployment has been effective but did not receive a response.
    


            “There is no question why the NM National Guard is helping out,” New Mexico National Guard spokesman Hank Minitrez said in a June Facebook post.
    


            The post described troops working behind the scenes in police offices, and conducting traffic management and manning perimeters around crime scenes when necessary.
    


            Albuquerque officials said last month they saw “success with targeted resources” in the city's downtown. Shootings are down 20% this year compared with 2024, the city said in a news release, a figure that tracks with data provided to CNN by the governor's office.
    


            Grisham, a Democrat, criticized President Donald Trump's deployment of 800 troops in Washington, DC, as “executive overreach” and said the contrast “couldn't be clearer” between her state's usage of the National Guard and that of Trump's.
    


            The DC National Guard reports only to the president, while a governor acts as the “commander in chief” of their state's troops and police agencies.
    


            Trump has suggested he could do the same in other major Democratic-led cities despite their leaders not asking for help.
    


            Meanwhile on the West Coast, questions are still lingering in a court case over the president's deployment of troops to Los Angeles in June as dramatic protests unfolded over immigration enforcement in parts of the city.
    


            The visual contrast between the troops in New Mexico and those sent to LA and the capital shows a difference in approach and intent.
    


            Grisham's office said the “key difference” between her deployment of troops and Trump's is her order was in response to direct requests from local communities. “While President Trump uses the National Guard to trample local leadership, New Mexico brings together local and state governments to make our communities genuinely safer,” she said.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the federal intervention in his state “purposely inflammatory.” Washington, DC, Attorney General Brian Schwalb called the president's actions unnecessary and pointed out violent crime in the district reached 30-year lows last year.
    


            Trump said he was going to “look at” taking action in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles because of their crime rates when he announced his plans to take control of DC's police department this week. It is not clear what specifically Trump wants to do in other cities.
    


            New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have all seen a sustained decline in crime so far this year, according to a mid-year report from the independent nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice.
    


            It's a “dangerous precedent” for the federal government to start deploying troops to deal with local and state policing matters, as they are historically used for crowd control, protecting federal property and federal workers, or responding to a natural disaster, according to Jeffrey Swartz, a former National Guard member and professor emeritus at Cooley Law School.
    


            The courts in California have yet to address a claim at the center of the case brought by Newsom to block Trump's deployment of troops in the city: whether the troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law prohibiting the use of the US military for domestic law enforcement.
    


            The three-day trial concluded last week, but the judge did not say when he will rule.
    


Federal judge questions if Trump's deployment of the National Guard in the Los Angeles area is lawful



            “When the president nationalizes a unit or a state National Guard, they now fall under the Posse Comitatus Act saying they are not allowed to be used for civil policing,” said Swartz. “He cannot authorize federal troops to make arrests. That is solely within the power of the governor.”
    


            The National Guard can, however, take someone into custody under circumstances where there's a danger to federal property or federal officers, he added.
    


            The act reserves law enforcement functions to the states, but its language is short, which “lends itself to vagueness and argumentation,” said David Shapiro, lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
    


            Swartz said National Guardsmen “don't like the idea of being on the streets and being put in a position where they might have to use force against fellow citizens.”
    


            “These people are citizen soldiers, not full-time. They have jobs. They have families,” he said. “They signed up to protect the country against external threats, not internal ones.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump that the United States and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the war, a U.S. official said Sunday.

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, who took part in the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, said it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called it “game-changing.”

“We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” Witkoff told CNN's “State of the Union.” 

Witkoff offered few details on how such an arrangement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his deep-seated objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership, a step that Kyiv has long sought.

It was expected to be a key topic Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and major European leaders meet with Trump at the White House to discuss ending the 3 1/2-year conflict.

“BIG PROGRESS ON RUSSIA,” Trump said Sunday on social media. “STAY TUNED!”




Article 5, the heart of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance, says an armed attack against a member nation is considered an attack against them all.

What needed to be hammered out at this week's talks were the contours of any security guarantees, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also participated in the summit. Ukraine and European allies have pushed the U.S. to provide that backstop in any peace agreement to deter future attacks by Moscow.

“How that's constructed, what we call it, how it's built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that's what we'll be talking about over the next few days with our partners,” Rubio said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” 

It was unclear, however, whether Trump had fully committed to such a guarantee. Rubio said it would be “a huge concession.”

The comments shed new light on what was discussed in Alaska. Before Sunday, U.S. officials had offered few details even as both Trump and Putin said their meeting was a success.

Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty.”

“The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that would prevent them from — or that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels alongside Zelenskyy, applauded the news from the White House as a European coalition looks to set up a force to police any future peace in Ukraine.

“We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the ‘coalition of the willing' — including the European Union — is ready to do its share,” she said.

Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. for signaling that it was willing to support such guarantees but said much remained unclear.

“There are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do — and this is our main task: We need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO,” he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the substance of security guarantees to secure any peace arrangement will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label.

At the White House meeting, Macron said European leaders will ask the U.S. to back their plans to beef up Ukraine's armed forces with more training and equipment and deploy an allied force away from the front lines.

“We'll show this to our American colleagues, and we'll tell them, ‘Right, we're ready to do this and that, what are you prepared to do?'” Macron said. “That's the security guarantee.”

Witkoff and Rubio defended Trump's decision to abandon a push for a ceasefire, arguing that the Republican president had pivoted toward a full peace agreement because so much progress had been made at the summit.

“We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. “We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.”

Rubio, appearing on several TV news shows Sunday, said it would have been impossible to reach any truce Friday because Ukraine was not there.

“Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.”

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, also voiced caution on the progress made.

“We're still a long ways off,” he said. “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We're not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made towards one.”

Among the issues expected to dominate Monday's meeting: What concessions Zelenskyy might accept on territory.

In talks with European allies after the summit, Trump said Putin reiterated that he wants the key Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas, European officials said. It was unclear among those briefed whether Trump sees that as acceptable.

Witkoff said the Russians have made clear they want territory as determined by legal boundaries instead of the front lines where territory has been seized.

“There is an important discussion to be had with regard to Donetsk and what would happen there. And that discussion is going to specifically be detailed on Monday,” he said.

Zelenskyy has rejected Putin's demands that Ukraine give up the Donbas region, which Russia has failed to take completely, as a condition for peace.

In Brussels, the Ukrainian leader said any talks involving land must be based on current front lines, suggesting he will not abandon land that Russia has not taken.

“The contact line is the best line for talking, and the Europeans support this,” he said. “The constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible, impossible to give up territory or trade land.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Inside BYD's plan to rule the waves","https://www.businessinsider.com/see-byds-fleet-car-carrying-cargo-ships-tesla-2025-8","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

Elon Musk had a problem. As Tesla struggled to ramp up sales in October 2022, it faced a critical shortage of ships to deliver its EVs.

""There weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains, there weren't enough car carriers,"" Musk told investors, after Tesla announced it had delivered tens of thousands of cars fewer than it made over the previous quarter.

As Tesla struggled, its biggest Chinese rival devised a novel solution.

BYD, which is on course to surpass Tesla this year as the world's top seller of EVs, decided in 2022 to build a fleet of seven giant ships, each capable of carrying thousands of cars.

Unlike most of its Western rivals, which typically buy space on car carriers operated by shipping companies, BYD has cut out the intermediary as it doubles down on ambitious plans to sell half its cars outside China by 2030.

Six of BYD's giant ships, which are emblazoned with the company's livery and a striking red and white color scheme, have entered service in the past year.

Data obtained by Business Insider from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic shows how the Chinese carmaker is using this fleet to drive an unprecedented international expansion, flooding ports in Europe, Brazil, and Mexico as it takes the fight to Tesla and overtakes legacy automakers.

BYD's first ship set sail in January 2024, when the BYD Explorer No.1 — a 200-meter-long, 13-deck, roll-on roll-off behemoth — went into service.

In July, the Zhengzhou, which can carry up to 7,000 vehicles, became the seventh vessel to join the fleet. The largest ship in BYD's armada, the Shenzhen, has a capacity of over 9,000 vehicles, making it one of the world's largest car-carrying vessels.

The massive ships have been busy. After launching, Explorer No.1 immediately began a 41-day voyage to Europe, the first of three separate trips there in 2024.

Explorer No.1 has also made three voyages to Brazil since May 2024. In May this year, it docked in the Brazilian port of Portocel in its second visit in four months, with two other BYD ships, the Hefei and the Shenzhen, also arriving in Brazil in April and May.

All three arrived fully laden and left empty as BYD raced to deliver its vehicles to Brazil ahead of a planned EV tariff rise in July.

The voyages to Europe and Brazil coincide with BYD's sales surging in both markets.

BYD, which did not respond to a request for comment for this story, sold just 2,500 vehicles in Brazil in the first half of 2023. It's sold over 56,000 vehicles there so far this year, per data from Brazil's National Federation of Automotive Vehicle Distribution.

That's more than Nissan, Renault, and Ford, and it has seen BYD take a dominant position in one of the world's fastest-growing EV markets.

In Europe, BYD's sales in the first half of the year were more than 300% higher than over the same period in 2024.

The Chinese carmaker sold more pure battery-electric vehicles than Musk's automaker in Europe for the first time in April, and its global EV sales have outpaced Tesla's for the past three quarters.

Stian Omli, a senior vice president at logistics intelligence firm Esgian, told Business Insider that BYD was essentially operating a ""shuttle service"" between its production hubs in China and key ports in Europe and Brazil.

BYD's strategy is shaking up the car shipping industry, which has been dominated historically by a handful of established shipping companies that usually plan and invest on cycles of a decade or longer.

Companies like Norwegian logistics giant Wallenius Wilhelmsen and Japanese firm NYK Line sell space aboard their ships to multiple companies, then try to stop at as many ports as possible and pick up cargo for the return voyages. But Omli said BYD's strategy was to go direct, dump a massive number of EVs at one or two destination ports, and often return to China empty.

""Just like they have changed the competitive landscape when it comes to cars, the Chinese are also changing the competitive landscape when it comes to the car carriers,"" Omli said.

Stephen Dyer, managing director at auto consultancy AlixPartners, told Business Insider that the Chinese EV industry's drive to expand overseas is driven by a ""never-ending"" price war at home, as over 100 EV brands fight it out in the world's most brutally competitive car market.

""If you can succeed outside China, you gain credibility with your core market consumers in China,"" said Dyer.

BYD could do with a boost. In July, the automaker's sales fell for the first time this year, putting its target of selling 5.5 million cars in 2025 at risk.

BYD's decision to operate its own ships had its roots in a post-COVID supply crunch between 2021 and 2023, when high demand combined with a shortage of specialised car carriers. This crunch sent the price of one car carrier for a yearlong charter soaring as high as $125,000 per day, far above the typical pre-COVID high of around $25,000, Omli said.

This is what made Musk rage and prompted BYD to embark on its radical strategy just as it was beginning to enter international markets in earnest.

BYD's setup allows the company to avoid being caught out if prices soar again, Omli said, and also gives it more flexibility to send its cars where and when it wants.

Control over its supply chain is a key part of BYD's formula for building EVs quicker and cheaper than its rivals. The company manufactures almost all of its own parts. Executive vice president Stella Li previously said that the tires and windows of BYD's Dolphin hatchback were the only parts not made in-house.

""Developing your own component suppliers gives BYD not only some cost leverage over other suppliers, but also the flexibility to do things much faster,"" Dyer said.

""When you have your own fleet, it's the same idea. It allows you to do things quickly and flexibly. You can divert them to anywhere that you want to go, even part of the way on the voyage. You're assured of supply,"" he added.

BYD is not the only Chinese EV company to dabble in deep-sea shipping.

Rivals such as SAIC Motors have built even larger fleets, and Omli estimated the share of the global deep-sea car carrier fleet controlled by Chinese companies will rise from 10-15% to as much as 25% in the next few years.

It's a hefty investment. Omli estimated that building the first four ships in its fleet cost BYD around $500 million, with such ships typically costing between $100 and $130 million each to build.

BYD's fleet shows no signs of slowing down. The automaker's monthly vehicle exports in July were nearly three times higher than a year ago, per company figures, and its vessels have made six voyages to Europe so far this year.

Recently, BYD's fleet has deployed its ""shuttle service"" strategy in Mexico. The 200-meter-long Changzhou became the first BYD vessel to arrive in the country in June, before criss-crossing the Pacific and returning with another load a month later.

The Explorer No.1 has just made the same journey, docking at the Mexican port of Lazaro Cardenas on 14 August.

BYD recently abandoned plans to build a factory in Mexico, but the company's EVs are still in high demand there. Executives say they expect sales to double this year.

Data from Esgian shows that the four BYD vessels it tracks — The Explorer No.1, Shenzhen, Hefei, and Changzhou — have visited the Mexican ports of Mazatlan and Lararo Cardenas, along with Portocel, more than any other ports outside Asia this year.

While BYD's shipbuilding surge has given the company the flexibility to export its EVs at unprecedented volume, the strategy has risks.

The company and its Chinese rivals have shipped so many vehicles to Europe over the past two years that it has put shipping infrastructure under pressure and turned some ports into giant parking lots.

Germany-based auto analyst Matthias Schmidt told Business Insider that most of BYD's sales in Europe were to companies and dealerships, rather than consumers.

Schmidt said he believed BYD's strategy was to flood the market through corporate channels and build enough momentum to become a recognisable brand for European consumers.

The shipping supply crunch that pushed BYD to build its fleet has now mostly abated. A wave of car-carrying ships has been launched in the past two years, easing the shortage and bringing prices down to around $50,000 per day for one car carrier on a one-year charter, with Omli estimating they will probably fall to around $30,000.

With shipping via external carriers a more affordable option, Schmidt said BYD now has to justify the massive costs of running its own fleet by exporting more vehicles.

""That's probably partly behind the high number of vehicles coming to Europe right now. They need to ship those vessels relatively full to maximise utilisation,"" Schmidt added.

Alexander Brown, a senior analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies, said that ""a lot has changed"" since BYD went all in on its own ships three years ago.

Since then, Western economies have raised trade barriers to protect their own auto industries from Chinese carmakers, and the Trump administration has set about reordering global trade with tariffs.

With this protectionism in mind, BYD has another big investment: factories. It recently began production at its new factory in Brazil, on the site of a plant Ford closed in 2021 after years of poor sales and big losses, ending a century of Ford production in the country.

The Detroit automaker also shut down multiple plants in Europe, and Chinese automakers are now filling that gap. BYD is building production sites for the European market in Hungary and Turkey.

Brown added that, if BYD had known how much tariffs would rise after going all in on cargo ships, ""they may have done things a little bit differently.""

Kanika Mohan thought she'd have a job after graduation — and hopefully it would come with three meals and laundry service.

The 21-year-old studied computer science, had a slate of summer internships at top tech companies, and regularly attended campus career fairs. A first-generation college student, the 2025 grad felt STEM was the surefire path to corporate success.

""I love building things and computer science was a pretty hot topic over social media,"" Mohan said. The jobs were cushy, with all kinds of perks. ""It was just insane to think about,"" she added. ""I never saw my parents have any of those jobs. My parents worked regular, non-corporate, blue-collar jobs.""

Frustrated by a monthslong job hunt, Mohan began looking outside Big Tech. She said she applied for business analyst and marketing roles at airlines, banks, and consumer companies, and any other opportunity she could find in her skillset. She was eventually hired by a major tech company, but she's glad that she broadened her search.

Mohan's experience is increasingly common. Jobs in computer science and tech have long been advertised as a path to lucrative salaries and luxurious office perks. But, with AI and widespread corporate cost-cutting contributing to a white-collar hiring slowdown, the industry is hemorrhaging entry-level opportunities.

The tech job market is not just rough for newcomers. Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor, wrote in a new blog post that the US tech industry seems to be in an employment recession because it mirrors the Great Recession. US job postings for tech workers on job-search platform Indeed have cooled more than overall postings from Great Resignation peaks. However, some more experienced job seekers may fare better if they have the skills needed in the growing AI talent war.

As doors close across the industry, tech grads are having to rethink their dream roles. BI spoke with Gen Zers and labor market experts to understand the challenges young tech aspirants are facing — and potential solutions.

Business Insider is reporting on how each generation is experiencing the job market. If you're open to sharing your experience, reach out to one of these reporters at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com, jkaplan@businessinsider.com, and mhoff@businessinsider.com.

And read our coverage:

After landing her role, Mohan now teaches other 20-somethings on TikTok about how to break into the tech industry.

""One thing I realized is that a lot of people have a dream company or a dream role,"" she said. ""But it's really tough to do that anymore. You can't just be like, 'I want to work at Microsoft, so I'm only going to apply to Microsoft.' Chances are you won't get a job at Microsoft.""

Economists said this is a smart strategy. The number of computer and information sciences grads has increased in recent years, so holders of those degrees face more competition for a shrinking number of openings. AI is also shifting what entry-level work looks like in those fields, and companies are looking for ways to cut costs and streamline their workforce.

Zhao, the Glassdoor economist, told Business Insider that many tech employers have been slow to hire entry-level workers. A Burning Glass Institute report showed that the unemployment rate for Gen Zers and younger millennials in computer and math occupations has recently increased from before the pandemic, meaning recent graduates could be up against others competing for similar roles.

""It's no surprise that new graduates in computer science and engineering have had a tough time getting their foot in the door,"" Zhao said.

It's part of why Gen Zers like Timothy Innamorato are considering pivoting. He wanted to work in tech, but he's also been applying for grocery store and janitorial jobs.

Since completing a certification program in computer science and information technology last year, 27-year-old Innamorato has sent out a few hundred job applications, he said, and has landed around eight interviews in his field.

""I've been shifting my views on whether or not I even want to continue looking at the moment, especially with the AI thing that's happening now,"" he said.

He's also gotten a few interviews for grocery store jobs, which he's been applying to because he needs something to keep him afloat. He's had some success getting callbacks when he applies to custodial positions in his local school district.

""Everybody now is shifting over to the idea of going to do trades, so being a plumber or doing HVAC or being an electrician. Honestly, that doesn't sound like a bad thing, it's just that you got to be on your feet a lot more and you got to go to people's houses and crawl in attics,"" he said. ""It's not the same as IT. But I mean, I don't know.""

Charley Kim, 23, recently landed a software engineering role at a Big Tech company. He said he's lucky — he graduated in 2024 with a computer science degree and knows several friends who are still looking for work.

""There are just so many people applying to the jobs, and there's only a limited number of jobs out there,"" Kim said, adding, ""Getting an interview is probably harder than the interviews themselves.""

Though Kim said that the job hunt can feel like a random ""numbers game,"" he thinks the effort he put into networking paid off. Not only did talking to people already in the tech industry help him hone his application, he said it allowed him to get the referrals he needed to make his résumé stand out from the pile.

Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, said it's important to build a community because job searching can be time-consuming and emotionally taxing. As Mohan put it, the post-grad job search can feel ""really scary, really harsh, and really painful.""

Cruzvergara said your community can include friends, advisors, or whoever can help you feel better and give you real feedback during job hunting.

Cruzvergara also suggested not filling out hundreds of applications and instead making sure you're putting enough time into checking out the company, including whether it seems like a good fit.

""Mass applying is actually hurting people because they're putting in lower-quality applications that aren't going to stand up in a competitive applicant pool,"" Bonnie Dilber, a recruiter at a software company, previously told Business Insider.

Natasha Pillay-Bemath, vice president of global talent acquisition and executive search at IBM, said there will continue to be demand for entry-level talent, especially in ""more critical, complex spaces of tech like AI and cloud."" Strong applicants should show that they can both master using AI and also lean on soft skills like creativity and effective communication, she said, as AI takes away the ""rote work"" of an entry-level hire.

Mohan said she had a few different versions of her résumé and cover letter depending on the types of roles she was applying for. Putting her experience and interests on paper — and occasionally using AI to optimize for specific positions — helped her build confidence.

""Building my résumé early on helped me also realize that I know I can switch industries,"" she said. ""I realized what industry I like and what roles I like because there's so, so many different things you can do. You won't know that unless you actually try.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Wellgistics Launches Blockchain Payment System for 6,500 US Pharmacies","https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/wellgistics-launches-blockchain-payment-system-for-6500-us-pharmacies","Sun, 17 Aug 2025 19:54:11 GMT","



This marks the biggest deployment of cryptocurrency payments in healthcare to date. The system runs on the XRP Ledger, offering pharmacies instant payments instead of waiting days for traditional bank transfers.

A major pharmaceutical distributor just made crypto payments a reality for thousands of pharmacies across America. Wellgistics Health rolled out its XRP-powered payment system on August 13, 2025, letting over 6,500 independent pharmacies process drug purchases using blockchain technology.

The XRP Implementation Program works through a partnership with RxERP, a pharmacy software company. Pharmacies can now pay suppliers and move money in seconds rather than the usual 1-3 days needed for wire transfers or bank payments.

The blockchain system cuts costs dramatically. Traditional bank wires cost $10-$30 per transaction, while XRP transfers cost less than $0.0002 each. For small pharmacy owners dealing with tight profit margins, these savings add up quickly.

Brian Norton, CEO of Wellgistics Health, said pharmacy owners understand the benefits. “Independent pharmacy owners are far more forward-thinking than many realize,” Norton explained. “They see the power of blockchain and understand how transformative this will be as it scales across the industry.”

The system handles compliance requirements that are crucial in healthcare. All payments meet HIPAA privacy rules and anti-money laundering laws. Every transaction gets recorded on the XRP Ledger, creating a permanent record for audits and tracking.

Independent pharmacies face serious cash flow problems with traditional payment systems. When they order drugs from suppliers, they often wait days for payments to clear. This delay makes it harder to restock inventory quickly when patients need medications.

The new blockchain system solves this problem by settling payments instantly. Pharmacies can now reorder supplies immediately after making payments, improving their ability to serve patients. The 24/7 operation means payments work even on weekends and holidays.

Wellgistics already serves more than 6,500 independent pharmacies and 200 pharmaceutical manufacturers nationwide. The company handles wholesale drug distribution and prescription routing services across the United States.

Wellgistics committed to blockchain technology earlier this year. In May 2025, the company announced it would hold XRP as a treasury asset alongside using it for payments. The company secured a $50 million credit line to support its blockchain infrastructure development.

The NASDAQ-listed company (WGRX) went public in February 2025 after being spun off from Danam Health. However, the stock has dropped more than 80% since its debut, closing recently at $0.62 per share.

Despite stock performance issues, Wellgistics continues expanding its blockchain initiatives. The company filed SEC documents outlining plans to use XRP for treasury management and capital raising purposes.

The healthcare sector is slowly adopting blockchain technology for various uses. The global blockchain healthcare market was worth $7.04 billion in 2023 and could reach $214.86 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Other healthcare companies have also started using cryptocurrency. Prenetics Global Limited, a health sciences company, bought 187 Bitcoin worth $20 million earlier this year. Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin for its reserves.

Wellgistics joins other companies that have added XRP to their strategic holdings, showing growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency for business operations.

The pharmaceutical industry processes massive amounts of payments between manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies. Blockchain technology offers transparency and speed that traditional banking cannot match for these complex transactions.

Wellgistics plans to expand the program beyond pharmacy payments. The next phase includes onboarding pharmaceutical manufacturers for direct blockchain-to-blockchain transactions. This would eliminate even more intermediaries from the drug supply chain.

The company also wants to launch direct-to-patient programs. These would let manufacturers ship medications straight to patients' homes while coordinating with pharmacies and doctors through the blockchain system.

Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan called the development “real utility and use for XRP and the XRPL.” He shared evidence showing that pharmacies are already joining the program, not just planning to join in the future.

The program currently operates in beta mode while pharmacies complete onboarding and training. Full 24/7 operations will roll out as more pharmacies join the system and become comfortable with blockchain payments.

Wellgistics has created the first large-scale cryptocurrency payment system in American healthcare. The XRP-powered platform offers 6,500 pharmacies instant, low-cost payments that could transform how the industry handles money.

Success of this program may encourage other healthcare companies to adopt similar blockchain solutions. For an industry known for slow adoption of new technology, Wellgistics is proving that cryptocurrency can solve real business problems in regulated sectors.

I appreciate that they call this out.  This means that if you're using Postgres primarily for storing data where it's ok if you lose a few (like time series data) then Clickhouse is the clear and obvious choice.But if the transactionality is key for you (like a financial application or the data for an application) then Postgres still makes more sense.

ClickHouse defaults to: ""fsync_after_insert = false"".A more fair comparison might at least do ""SET synchronous_commit TO OFF"" on the PostgreSQL side. (But for this UPDATE benchmark, I think the results would still largely be the same.)

As long as you can get away with Postgres, stay with Postgres. I'm sure this update here is a step forward just like version-merging is much better than cancelling rows but it's always got a ton of downsides.Unrelated to updating data, the CH defaults drive me insane, the null join behavior alone made me reconsider trying to rip CH out of our infrastructure (after wasting too long trying to figure out why my query ""wasn't working"").Lastly I'll say, if CH does what you need and you are comfortable learning all the ends and outs, then it can do some really cool things. But it's important to remember it's NOT a normal RDMS nor can you use it like one. I almost wish they didn't use SQL as the query language, then people would think about it differently, myself included.

We've been doing our best to address and clarify these differences, whether through product features like this one or by publishing content to educate users. For example: https://clickhouse.com/blog/postgres-to-clickhouse-data-mode... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ipwqfuBEbc.From what we've observed, the learning curve typically ranges from a few weeks for smaller to medium migrations to 1–2 months for larger ones moving real-time OLAP workloads from Postgres to ClickHouse. Still, customers are making the switch and finding value — hundreds (or more) are using both technologies together to scale their real-time applications: Postgres for low-latency, high-throughput transactions and ClickHouse for blazing-fast (100x faster) analytics.We're actively working to bridge the gap between the two systems, with features like faster UPDATEs, enhanced JOINs and more. That's why I'm not sure your comment is fully generalizable — the differences largely stem from the distinct workloads they support, and we're making steady progress in narrowing that gap.- Sai from the ClickHouse team here.

If you are needing updates then perhaps ClickHouse isn't the perfect choice. Something like ScyllaDB might be a better compromise if you want performant updates with (some sort of) consistency guarantees. If you need stronger guarantees you will need a ""proper"" database but then you're unlikely to get the performance. AKA tradeoffs or no free lunch.

reply

Either way, CH shouldn't be the store of truth when you need record level fidelity.

CH has been my favorite database since I discovered PostgreSQL 20 years ago. My view point is don't use postgres unless you can't use CH.

Prior to July 2025 (ClickHouse v25.7), ClickHouse did not support UPDATE statements. At all. Like most columnar, analytics databases. We spent a lot of effort designing and implementing a way to support high-performance, SQL-standard UPDATE statements. This test was pretty much just trying to see how good of a job we had done, by comparing ourselves to the gold standard, Postgres. (If you're curious, we also wrote about how we built the UPDATE support in depth https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-2-sql-styl...)We have some updates to the post in progress; we originally deliberately used cold runs for both ClickHouse & Postgres, because we wanted to look at the ""raw"" update speed of the engine, vs. the variability of cache hits. But TL;DR when you run a more ""real world"" test where caches are warm and Postgres is getting very high cache-hit ratio, its point updates are consistently ~2ms, while ClickHouse is somewhere ~6ms (bulk updates are still many multiples faster in ClickHouse even with the cache in play).

A test that would show PG's strengths over ClickHouse for OLTP would be a stress test with a long-running set of updates.ClickHouse maintains updates as uncompacted patches merged in the background, which is how you would do it with a columnar store. But if you have an update-heavy workload, these patches would accumulate and your query performance would start to suffer. PG on the other hand completes all update work inline, and wouldn't get degrading performance under update-heavy regimes.This is just a fundamental artifact of OLAP vs OLTP, maybe OLAP can be optimized to the point where it doesn't really matter for most workloads, but a theoretical edge remains with row-based stores and updates.

I'd wager the overhead in Postgres is probably lighter (though it's also light in ClickHouse), so you're right, this would be an interesting test. We actually had something like that planned, to run concurrent UPDATEs and SELECTs at different volumes for a period of time, to see how they each cope. Will definitely do it!

Did you run any tests with the new transaction system in ClickHouse? It would be super interesting to see how it effected the batch updates.

Medicare enrollees who buy the optional Part D drug benefit may see substantial premium price hikes — potentially up to $50 a month — when they shop for next year's coverage.

Such drug plans are used by millions of people who enroll in what is called original Medicare, the classic federal government program that began in 1965 and added a drug benefit only in 2006. The drug plans are offered through private insurers, and enrollees must pay monthly premiums.

It's not known whether insurers will pursue the maximum increase allowed, as premium prices for next year won't be revealed until closer to open enrollment, which starts Oct. 15.

Increases are expected to mainly affect stand-alone Part D plans, not the drug coverage offered as part of Medicare Advantage, the private sector alternative to original Medicare. More on that later.

Policy experts say premiums are likely to go up for several reasons, including increased use of some higher-cost prescription drugs; a law that capped out-of-pocket spending for enrollees; and changes in a program aimed at stabilizing price increases that the Trump administration has continued but made less generous.

One thing is surer than ever, say many policy experts: Beneficiaries should not simply roll over their existing stand-alone Medicare drug plans.

""Everyone should shop plans in open enrollment,"" said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Here are three reasons prices would rise.

1. It's the spending!

Every year, insurers keep an eye on what they're spending on drugs so they can build that into their premium estimates. Spending covers both the prices charged by drugmakers and volume, meaning how many people take the medications and how often.

And it's up. Spending by insurers and government programs for prescription drugs in 2024 across the market grew more than 10%, which is slightly greater than in recent years, according to a research report published last month in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy. Estimates are not yet available for this year's trends.

Still, in 2024, researchers found that drug prices overall decreased slightly. Spending rose because of drugs coming on the market and increased utilization, especially for pricey weight loss drugs and another category of medications that treat various autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Such increased use is evident in Medicare. Many beneficiaries, for example, are treated for autoimmune conditions. And even though Medicare doesn't cover treatment for weight loss, many members have diabetes or other conditions that a new type of weight loss drugs can treat.

The Trump administration, according to The Washington Post, is considering a five-year pilot program in which Medicare Part D plans could voluntarily expand access to the drugs, which can cost more than $1,000 a month without insurance. Details have not yet been provided, but the pilot program would not begin in Medicare until 2027.

Another wild card for insurers is the Trump administration's tariffs on businesses that purchase products made overseas, which could boost drug prices because the U.S. imports a lot of its pharmaceuticals. Much, however, remains unknown about whether drugmakers will pass along any additional tariff costs to consumers.

So, while rising spending is one factor, it isn't the only reason next year's premium prices are expected to go up.

2. New out-of-pocket caps for consumers

Changes made to Medicare aimed at helping people with high out-of-pocket costs for expensive medications may be a bigger factor.

Here's why: Starting this year, Medicare enrollees have a limit on how much they must pay out-of-pocket for prescription drugs. It's capped at $2,000, a threshold that will rise each year to cover inflation.

Lawmakers in Congress set those changes in the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden. The law also shifted a larger share of the cost of drugs used by Medicare beneficiaries from the federal program to insurers.

That $2,000 cap is a big change from previous years, when people taking expensive drugs had a higher threshold to meet annually and were on the hook to pay 5% of the drug's cost even after meeting that amount. Those additional 5% payments ended last year under the provisions of the IRA.

Before that law passed, ""people would spend $10,000 or $15,000 out-of-pocket each year just for a single drug,"" Dusetzina said. ""The Inflation Reduction Act was necessary to make Part D proper health insurance, but there's a cost to do so.""

While the cap is a big help for affected consumers, the reduced amounts paid by some beneficiaries — coupled with the cost shift to insurers — could lead plans to spread their increased expenses across all policyholders through higher premiums. A growing number of health plans have also begun to require enrollees to pay a percentage of a drug's cost, rather than a flat-dollar copay, which can lead to larger-than-expected costs at the pharmacy counter, Dusetzina said.

While consumers not currently taking high-cost specialty drugs may not see a benefit in the $2,000 cap initially, they might one day, say policy experts, who note that drugmaker prices continue to rise and that enrollees could fall ill with a condition like cancer or multiple sclerosis for which they need a very high-priced drug.

""It's important to think not just in context of those groups who hit the cap every year, but also people are paying more in premiums to protect their future selves as well,” said Casey Schwarz, the senior counsel for education and federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group.

The new prescription drug cap and other changes apply to both the stand-alone Part D drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans. But those Medicare Advantage plans are not expected to increase the drug portion of their premiums, partly because the private sector plans are paid more per member than what it costs taxpayers for the traditional program.

That means Advantage plans have far more money to add benefits, such as vision and dental coverage, which traditional Medicare does not include, or to use them to cushion the impact of rising spending on drug costs, thus limiting premium increases.

Those additional benefits are advertised to attract customers to Medicare Advantage, which also sometimes offers plans with minimal or no monthly premium costs. There are other differences between traditional Medicare and private sector plans. For example, Advantage members must stick to doctors and hospitals in the plan's networks, and they may face more prior authorization or other hurdles than in the traditional program.

The growing difference between premiums — fueled by the extra rebates flowing to the private sector plans — ""is increasingly tilting coverage toward Medicare Advantage and making traditional Medicare plus a stand-alone PDP [prescription drug plan] unaffordable for many enrollees,"" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

3. Trump administration reduced funding meant to slow premium growth

The final factor in the premium increase equation is a program set up to slow the rise of premiums in stand-alone Part D plans.

It began under the Biden administration to offset premium increases tied to changes in the Inflation Reduction Act by temporarily injecting additional federal dollars to help insurers adjust to the new rules.

That plan sent just over $6 billion this year to Part D insurers.

And it had an effect.

The average monthly premium for a stand-alone Part D drug plan dropped 9%, from $43 last year to $39 this year, according to KFF, even when factoring in that some plans raised prices by up to $35 a month, the maximum increase allowed under the stabilization plan for this year.

In a memo released in late July, the Trump administration said it would continue the program for next year, while shaving about 40% of the funding. A government official told The Wall Street Journal that the administration felt that keeping the full funding would have mainly benefited the insurers and cost taxpayers an ""enormous, excess amount.""

The stabilization effort next year will send $10 a month per enrollee to Part D insurers to help keep premiums in check, down from $15 this year. Among other changes, it allows insurers to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month, up from the $35 allowed this year.

That would be a substantial increase, Cubanski noted, although it is not clear just how many insurers would pursue the full amount.

""We did see some plans this year were taking premium increases of that $35 amount in 2025, and I fully expect we will see some plans with increases up to $50 a month"" next year, she said.

Another reason to take a close look at all the options once open enrollment begins.

Jannik Sinner ended the dream run of World No. 136 Terence Atmane on Saturday at the Cincinnati Open, but not before navigating a tricky first-set test from the French lefty.

Celebrating his 24th birthday in style, defending champion Sinner delivered a rock-solid display to triumph 7-6(4), 6-2 and reach his eighth ATP Masters 1000 final. With his 86-minute victory, during which he did not face a break point, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings recorded his 200th tour-level win on hard courts and extended his win streak on the surface to 26 matches.

Many happy returns, Jannik 🎉Defending champion @janniksin celebrates his 24th birthday by returning to the showpiece final, defeating Atmane 7-6(4) 6-2! @CincyTennis | #CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/BcNCd0mrtT

Into his 28th tour-level final, Sinner awaits fierce rival Carlos Alcaraz or World No. 3 Alexander Zverev. The Italian trails first-placed Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, with both players battling it out in a thrilling contest for Year-End ATP No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Sinner will aim to defend his Cincinnati title and close the more than 1,000 point lead that Alcaraz owns in the Race.

Now a two-time Cincinnati finalist and a fan favourite in Ohio, Sinner was serenaded with 'Happy Birthday' by the adoring crowd after the match.

“It was a very, very tough challenge,” said Sinner. “Every time you play against something completely new, it's difficult, but playing against this guy in the later stages of a tournament is even more difficult. The pressure is higher and you know they deserve to be there… He has beaten incredible players throughout his wins.

“I knew that I had to be very careful, and my mindset was in a good spot. I felt like I handled the situations on the court very well. He was serving incredibly well in the first set. He has huge, huge potential, and I think we saw that in the tournament.”

After coming through qualifying and earning consecutive Top-10 wins against Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune en route to his first ATP Tour semi-final, Atmane imposed himself on the occasion with a supreme serving display in the opening stages, including dropping three consecutive aces on Sinner in the seventh game.

Yet the Frenchman undid his hard work by hitting his first double fault of the match to open the tie-break, which proved to be the difference-maker in an evenly contested first set.



While Sinner's own serving performance in the opener was admirable — he dropped just one of 21 points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats — there were concerning signs at the start of the second. Yet after a lengthy opening hold, which featured four Deuces, Sinner quickly brushed aside any doubts and began to make significant ground in Atmane's service games.

Moments before the players walked out onto Centre Court for their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, Atmane lightened the mood by surprising Sinner with a gift in the tunnel. The Frenchman, a fond fan of the Japanese trading card game Pokemon, gave the World No. 1 a card from his collection before they embraced and headed into battle.

Despite defeat, Atmane can reflect on a milestone week in Cincinnati, where he has surged 67 spots to a new career-high No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 23-year-old is next scheduled to compete in the qualifying event for the US Open, which begins Monday.
