                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Known for bringing erudite stateliness and dignity to Superman's General Zod, Stamp's decades-long film career contains far more than comic book villainy. With his piercing stare and ridiculously well-defined cheekbones, Stamp brought a palpable intensity to the screen. Amid his time as London's ‚ÄúIt‚Äù boy of the Swinging Sixties, he worked with cinema's most revered actors and directors. ‚ÄúHe leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,‚Äù the family said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe ask for privacy at this sad time.‚Äù Born in London's East End in 1938, Stamp grew up poor during the Blitz, with his father, a tugboat stoker, heading to war. In between shifts as a barmaid, his mother raised Stamp and his four siblings through the London bombings. ‚ÄúWho better to mold your life on?‚Äù Stamp later said. After working in advertising for several years, Stamp won a scholarship to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where he became roommates with Michael Caine, Stamp's one-time mentor. He made his screen debut in Peter Ustinov's adaptation of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, which earned him an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe. The role catapulted him to stardom, as did his dating life. Stamp became one of the era's most photographed stars while dating Julie Christie and supermodel Jean Shrimpton. He was even considered to succeed Sean Connery as James Bond. Unfortunately, his ideas ‚Äúput the frighteners‚Äù on producers. The '60s saw Stamp reach remarkable creative heights, working opposite cinema's most revered names, including Laurence Olivier and Ken Loach. In William Wyler's The Collector, Stamp played his first unsettlingly calm villain, an archetype he'd return to with masterful variation throughout his career. Still, he learned his greatest lessons working for directors ‚Äúwho don't really like me and never really wanted me.‚Äù ‚ÄúJohn Schlesinger, when I did Far From The Maddening Crowd, made it very clear that I wasn't his first choice. I was foisted on him by the producer,‚Äù Stamp told BFI. He returned broke and landed the most popular role of his career, demanding Earthlings ‚Äúknee before Zod‚Äù as General Zod in Superman and Superman II. Stamp built upon his Superman success with a diversity of roles. ‚ÄúMy characterization was based on how it would feel to be born into the wrong body,‚Äù he told The A.V. In addition to Limey, he was a fixture of the 1999 box office, appearing in Star Wars: Episode I‚ÄîThe Phantom Menace and Bowfinger. The couple published two cookbooks, based on his various dietary allergies, and divorced in 2008. He returned to Kypton, playing Jor-El on Smallville, and appeared in Tim Burton's Big Eyes. Appropriately, he returned to Mod London for 2021's Last Night In Soho, playing the type of brooding baddie that made him a star.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contrary to popular belief, longtime HGTV stars Erin and Ben Napier can't actually save the world ‚Äî despite many of their fans hoping they will. But on August 16, 2025, Erin inadvertently ruffled some feathers with an ‚Äúinconsequential‚Äù Instagram post about her and Ben's date night. Noting that they had ‚Äúhad dinner and a good state of the union,‚Äù Erin received lots of pushback from followers who thought she meant they'd been happily discussing how America is doing, rather than the state of their union as a couple ‚Äî a popular strategy developed by The Gottman Institute for married couples to discuss their relationship weekly. Erin told one fan that anyone who misunderstood her post should ‚Äúunfollow me immediately.‚Äù And when another fan insinuated that Erin and Ben were not doing enough to influence positive change in the United States, Erin was quick to respond with a hilarious bit of sass, sarcastically vowing to go ‚Äúfix everything.‚Äù also, can non strategic and inconsequential instagram posts make a comeback?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot while your countries on fire,‚Äù responded one follower in a since-deleted comment reviewed by EntertainmentNow. Within minutes, Erin replied to that follower ‚Äî who signed the comment from a ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù Canadian, including the Canadian flag emoji ‚Äî with a sarcastic quip that's also since been deleted. On August 17, one fan wrote, ‚ÄúMy hope is you worded your post this way so unhinged people would comment üòÇ ‚Ä¶. Erin, who has since limited her comments on the post, replied, ‚Äúanyone who thinks this post has a thing to do with politics needs to unfollow me immediately üòÑ seriously though.‚Äù That life style is now gone for those of us who care about democracy and freedom‚Äù It received over 48,000 likes within 24 hours and her comment section had plenty of supportive comments from fans who agreed with her wish for more posts about everyday life. ‚ÄúI'd love it if IG went back to ‚Äòhere's a piece of my day' type posts,‚Äù one fan wrote. Sometimes it's okay just to breathe and appreciate your life too üíû‚Äù Back to when social media was fun‚Ä¶end ‚Äúdoom scrolling‚Äù one inconsequential post at a time!‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows food prices have spiked by 2.9 percent since last July, and wholesale prices on fresh and dry vegetables increased by nearly 40 percent last month ‚Äî the biggest increase in the last three years. The Labor Department's producer price index, a measure of inflation on wholesale goods and producer costs, increased by nearly one percentage point from June to July. The data ‚Äúpoints to pipeline inflation that's likely to spill into consumer prices in the months ahead,‚Äù Michelle Green, a former Labor Department economist currently working at corporate planning firm Board, told Axios. According to the Consumer Price Index, prices for consumers have already risen on several foods. ‚ÄúKeep in mind, certain foods like coffee, cocoa that's used in chocolate, we can't grow these here, so we're going to be faced with higher prices or changing what we drink,‚Äù food trends expert Phil Lempert told WPTV West Palm Beach. While for now, it seems some companies are eating the cost of tariffs, they won't be able to hold off forever on pushing those rising costs to consumers. ‚ÄúIt will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers,‚Äù Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at financial markets research firm fwdbonds told PBS. These rising prices will not just be limited to foods. Home electronic prices, for example, rose 5 percent in July as compared to June.

The ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù congressional Republicans passed last month also cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by $186 billion, meaning more people may be turning to increasingly strapped food banks to make up for the loss in food assistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While speaking Saturday at his induction into the Television Academy Hall of Fame, the 5x Emmy-winning comedian praised Colbert as ‚Äútoo talented and too essential‚Äù and shared his thoughts on the future of late-night television. ‚ÄúYes, late-night television as we have known it since around 1950 is going to disappear. But those voices are not going anywhere,‚Äù said O'Brien. Meanwhile, Paramount is under fire for canceling The Late Show on the heels of the company's $16M settlement with Trump, which has been scrutinized as potential bribery by some lawmakers. George Cheeks, CBS‚Äòs Chair of TV Media, has since claimed that the talk show's ‚Äúeconomics made it a challenge for us to keep going.‚Äù Jeff Shell, president of Paramount under its new Skydance acquisition, has shown his support for the decision, explaining, ‚ÄúLate-night has a huge problem right now. ‚Ä¶ You can't make it work economically anymore.‚Äù Going scorched-earth on CBS ahead of his May 2026 departure, Colbert recently kicked off the job search while signing off for summer hiatus from The Late Show. ‚ÄúNetflix, call me I'm available in June,‚Äù he said last weekend on the show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years after its six-season run ended, Bob Odenkirk doesn't expect Better Call Saul to escape from behind bars anytime soon. Although he didn't sound optimistic about a revival of the Breaking Bad spin-off, which ran for six seasons on AMC from 2015 to '22, Odenkirk said ‚Äúof course I would‚Äù reprise his role as the titular scam artist/lawyer Saul Goodman. ‚ÄúThat part turned my life around, and I've given more to that part than anything I've done,‚Äù he said on Today. ‚ÄúVince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. They are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV. Odenkirk added of the possibility, ‚ÄúBut I don't think so. I think they've all moved on to some more amazing projects that you'll soon see.‚Äù In the Aug. 15, 2022 series finale ‚ÄòSaul Gone', Saul takes responsibility for years of his criminal activity, including his work with Walter White, resulting in an 86-year prison sentence. If there's another Saul show, it takes place inside prison,‚Äù added Odenkirk of a potential revival. After Breaking Bad‚Äòs five-season run from 2008 to 2013, Better Call Saul followed Saul Goodman six years before he got tangled up in Walter White's criminal enterprise. The show was nominated for multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. I'd give anything to see a BCS spinoff featuring Rhea Seehorn as Kim.

Born in July 22, 1938, in London, one of five children of Thomas Stamp and Ethel (Perrott) Stamp, the idea of growing up to become a movie star could not have been further from Stamp's mind or early experience. Initially, young Stamp worked in advertising, but he had long harbored dreams of acting, and trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Related Stories ‚ÄòTwo Seasons, Two Strangers' Review: Sho Miyake Is One of Japan's Most Perceptive Modern Filmmakers How ‚ÄòNight Always Comes' Cracks Action Sequences Wide Open Early success, including acclaim for his piercing blue eyes and iconic voice, notched him work with everyone from Federico Fellini to Marlon Brando, but his career seemingly fell off as he approached his thirties. His casting as General Zod in the first two ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù films of the '70s has long been viewed as his great comeback, but over the following decades, he continued to make compelling, often off-beat choices. Those included starring in ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert‚Äù as a transgender woman with unexpected tenderness and bringing his unique zeal to Steven Soderbergh's ‚ÄúThe Limey.‚Äù Always wonderful, always unpredictable. At the time, he was returning to the big screen with a lead role in ‚ÄúUnfinished Song.‚Äù ‚ÄúI've just grown used to doing roles that are tough guys, and it hasn't really made any difference to my life,‚Äù he said. Stamp looked back on the career- and life-changing calls behind his work in the ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù films, telling IndieWire, ‚ÄúI got recalled to do the first two ‚ÄòSuperman' movies, that I think are the very best of all those comic book movies. In a way it was very painful at the time, but it's proven to be a blessing in disguise. I'm sort of fearless at this point in my life. So even when I did General Zod, can you really imagine Robert Redford or Warren Beatty playing General Zod? So by the time Zod came up, I was really hungry to work. I guess that's why it became such a landmark role for me. There was nearly eight years of storing up energy being ready to let loose on the set of the ‚ÄòSuperman' movies.‚Äù The NYT notes that in ‚Äú2002, at age 64, he married Elizabeth O'Rourke, a 29-year-old Australian pharmacist; they divorced in 2008.‚Äù The NYT reported that ‚Äúinformation on survivors was not immediately available.‚Äù We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bob Odenkirk's modestly budgeted sequel Nobody 2 is having to settle for a third-place finish in its domestic box office debut as Zach Cregger's Weapons continues to fire on all cylinders and stay atop the chart in its sophomore outing, followed by Disney's family comedy Freakier Friday. Nobody 2, about a seemingly average suburban dad who leads a double life as a stealth operative, is on course to open on the lower end of expectations with $9.3 million from 3,260 locations after receiving a B+ CinemaScore from audiences (its audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes is more promising at 89 percent). Sydney Sweeney Just Had the Biggest Controversy of Her Career. Black Bear Names Lionsgate Vet David Spitz Head of U.S. The sequel cost a modest $25 million to make before marketing, so no one at Universal is losing sleep, since it is sure to make up ground when hitting premium VOD as early as three weeks from now (the studio has perfected the art of PVOD). From New Line and Warner Bros., Weapons had no trouble staying atop the chart in its sophomore outing with an estimated $25 million from 3,450 locations ‚Äî a scant decline of 43 percent. The female-skewing Freakier Friday, reteaming Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, is likewise grinning in its sophomore outing with an estimated haul $14.5 million from 3,975 cinemas for a worldwide cume of $86.3 million against a budget under $45 million. While Apple is making a major push into theatrical ‚Äî F1: The Movie is one of the summer's biggest blockbusters and is getting a traditional release in cinemas ‚Äî Highest 2 Lowest doesn't appear to be part of that strategy. A24, which partnered with Apple on Lee's latest movie, isn't making grosses public so far, but those with visibility into numbers being reported by some theaters suggest Highest 2 Lowest is doing tepid business for a movie with such a high-profile director and cast, who gathered together for a splashy world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The pic opened to an estimated $500,000 for a sixteenth-place finish. The crime-heist movie, which has been well received by critics, has taken more than two years to arrive on the big screen after first premiering at SXSW in 2023. Lionsgate insists the film is part of a multi-platform strategy, including premium VOD, and that its box office performance is in no way a disappointment, financial or otherwise. Americana opens in the wake of a media firestorm engulfing Sweeney after American Eagle dropped its ‚ÄúSydney Has Great Jeans‚Äù campaign July 23. Almost overnight, some TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying, ‚ÄúGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.‚Äù They claimed the comments promote eugenics since Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. While countless users dismissed such theories as utter nonsense, the debate went viral. Even President Donald Trump weighed in after The Guardian reported that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida prior to the 2024 election.

His recent features, all patiently-paced dramas about circumstantial relationships, share a compelling interest in the quiet. Not necessarily tranquility; almost every Miyake lead is outright depressed or a bundle of nerves about key issues in their life. Rather, he favors characters who struggle with loneliness, withdrawing from engaging with people much at all due to factors that make human connection harder for them. ‚ÄúAll the Long Nights‚Äù saw two office workers suffering from different detrimental conditions form a supportive bond to ease their respective pains. And in Miyake's gorgeous, lo-fi take on a sports movie, ‚ÄúSmall, Slow but Steady,‚Äù the quiet demeanor of its young boxer protagonist is due to a literal hearing impairment. She reads lips to understand people, while choosing to not articulate many of her inner thoughts.In Miyake's latest tender, beautifully textured feature (which just won Locarno's highest honor, the Golden Leopard), ‚ÄúTwo Seasons, Two Strangers,‚Äù the main character's tendency to say very little is rooted in a creative slump, intertwined with cultural isolation. At a Q&A session, she seems scared to answer the first question, suggesting that her main takeaway from watching her own work is that she doesn't have much talent.Within her own mind, she's a little more articulate. Japanese is the only language that leaves Li's mouth, but her occasional inner monologues are in her mother tongue, the most crucial example expressing her growing conflict with the very act of writing itself. Related Stories How ‚ÄòNight Always Comes' Cracks Action Sequences Wide Open ‚ÄòDry Leaf' Review: Alexandre Koberidze's Latest Is Low-Resolution and Hard Going ‚ÄúThings happen in life that can't be put into words,‚Äù she thinks. I want to just stand there forever, far away from words. But words always take hold of me without fail. When I first came to Japan, everything around me was full of mystery and fear. The things and feelings that used to be fresh have now been overtaken by words. Maybe travel is about trying to get away from words.‚ÄùTraveling to get away from the noise of urban life, in the hope it might provide greater clarity or purpose, drives both female protagonists in Miyake's film of two distinct halves. Contrasting Li, whose trip occurs in the winter, is Nagisa (Yuumi Kawai, ‚ÄúDesert of Namibia‚Äù), a young Japanese woman wandering a seaside town in the summer. Avoiding the tourist traps, she connects, albeit awkwardly, with Natsuo (Mansaku Takada), a similarly lonely soul visiting his relatives nearby.Miyake's ‚ÄúAll the Long Nights‚Äù was adapted from a novel by Maiko Seo and ‚ÄúSmall, Slow but Steady‚Äù was loosely based on ‚Äãthe autobiography of boxer Keiko Ogasawara. His introspective works would range from stories of ordinary life to more overt surrealism, their atmospheres tinged with dreaminess, eroticism and mysterious tensions. In pairing the otherwise unconnected comics, Miyake doesn't quite follow the template of Jacques Audiard's recent ‚ÄúParis, 13th District,‚Äù which interweaved the plots of three previously separate short stories by American cartoonist Adrian Tomine. When a typhoon hits the town, neither is deterred from honoring their plans. Sheltered by a hut, he sits and waits for her as torrential showers surround him. When she shows up, they share dessert that he brought, both of them wearing what they would have anyway if the sun had kept shining, to the extent that Nagisa has a bikini ready underneath her dress to swim with Natsuo in the rain-drenched ocean.Despite the seemingly sweet resolution to their storyline (and an ostensibly upbeat last line of dialogue), there's a strange undercurrent to the Nagisa and Natsuo segment that suggests foreboding as much as potential happiness ‚Äî a mysterious tension befitting the creator that Miyake is adapting. The rest of Miyake's film finds Li years after her Tsuge adaptation was written, still stuck on the idea of traveling from the tale of Nagisa and Natsuo as she struggles to write another project ‚Äî apparently about ninjas. The magic structural trick that Miyake pulls with Li is that she herself is the protagonist of another Tsuge story: an adaptation of ‚ÄúMr. The pair's initially stiff but gradually warm chats echo and augment those from Li's previous screenplay, including bonding over an understanding of deep loneliness.The build-up to the film's low-key, poetic resolution is made all the more moving by Shim's intelligent performance, which is effectively informed by the actor's positioning between two languages throughout, giving her a platform and reason to convey additional emotional nuances without dialogue ‚Äî the performer, in a sense, also breaking free from ‚Äúa cage of words‚Äù like her character. When working things out for the next chapter of our lives, we could all stand to get out of our own heads more to properly appreciate and take inspiration from the possibilities before us, instead of overthinking and then over-vocalizing our worries and doubts to the point of blocking our progress.

Have you been to the ‚ÄòLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran' Tour? So first of all, Shakira is an icon. This lady really has my heart. I have been playing drums for Shakira since 1998 I did an MTV Unplugged with her. We put a band together, and that's been kind of more or less the band ever since. It just feels like family here on the tour. It's a family environment, and I'm just proud that we can stand in solidarity as an Angeleno, as a native Mexican from Los Angeles, to be able to come back home after touring in Europe, and then to be able to open up for Shakira in front of our hometown, it's a blessing. I would say she's 110% involved in every decision that's being made. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

The former ‚ÄúReal Housewives of Beverly Hills‚Äù star is in treatment with Dr. Michael Scoma, whose first course is getting the reality star on antibiotics and antifungals, per Us Weekly. ‚ÄúI always joke my life is like ‚ÄòThe Last of Us?' I'm just turning into one of those black mold people. I have lumps on my face, and they're moving around,‚Äù Glanville told the outlet.

Glanville, who first noticed strange lumps on her face after filming ‚ÄúThe Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip‚Äù in 2023, is hopeful that Dr. Scoma's treatment plan will clear her symptoms. She discovered that she had a parasitic infection, and the lumps had spread to her upper body, causing a sensation of movement.

Two limited edition TAP cards featuring the late rapper were also released on Friday as part of the L.A. transit agency's Metro x Culture series, which highlights the city's cultural landscape, artists, musicians and community figures.

The station known in the short-term as Nipsey Hussle Station will hold on to its new name through Aug. 31.Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins notes, ‚ÄúHussle's legacy goes far beyond music. He was a visionary who understood the power of community, connection and opportunity. At Metro, we share his belief that public transportation is more than just a way to get around; it's a vital lifeline that can unite neighborhoods, open doors and uplift lives. Honoring Hussle with these commemorative TAP cards and temporarily renaming the Hyde Park station is our way of celebrating his enduring impact on Los Angeles and reaffirming our commitment to building an accessible, inclusive transit system that serves all Angelenos.‚Äù A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
