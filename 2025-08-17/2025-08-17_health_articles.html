                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pop-up screening for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk held at community pharmacies and large-scale sporting events can identify people with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors, according to a study published in JACC, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology, and simultaneously presented at the 73rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand. Regular preventative screenings can identify modifiable risk factors like elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated body mass index (BMI) and smoking, but many people aren't participating in screenings or receiving recommended preventative care. Heart health checks in the community can identify risk factors for future heart disease that can be managed by lifestyle changes or early preventive medications and save lives down the road. In this study, researchers performed pop-up screenings at community pharmacies and an international cricket game to determine the number of participants who had uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors. Health stations were placed in 311 community pharmacies across Australia between Dec. 15, 2023 and Jan. 31, 2024. The health stations were also available for nine hours a day during an international cricket match played daily between Dec. 26-29, 2023. Screenings were performed as part of the Shane Warne Legacy Health Test initiative in memory of Shane Warne, an Australian cricket icon who suffered a premature and sudden death in 2022. Overall, 52,453 (68.9%) of participants met the primary outcome of having at least one uncontrolled risk factor: elevated BP reading, overweight or obese, or active smoker. Over one third (37.2%) of participants with recorded BP readings were in the hypertensive range. By individual risk factor, those at the cricket match had higher rates of elevated BP and BMI, but lower rates of smoking compared to those at pharmacies. About half of those with elevated BP readings had not had a BP check in the past year and over 80% were not on any antihypertensive medication. About half of those with elevated BP readings had not had a BP check in the past year and almost 70% were not on any antihypertensive medications. "Pop-up screening can be creatively nested into community-based programs and events that are frequented by specific at-risk populations," Nicholls said. "These could direct screening efforts towards populations that could stand to benefit the most from ASCVD risk reduction while concurrently addressing disparities in access to healthcare."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Medical University of South Carolina team reports in Frontiers in Immunology that it has engineered a new type of genetically modified immune cell that can precisely target and neutralize antibody-producing cells complicit in organ rejection. Similar strategies have been used to stimulate the immune system against certain cancers, but Ferreira's team is the first to show its utility in tamping down immune responses that can lead to organ rejection. More than 50,000 organ transplants take place each year in the U.S. While often lifesaving, these procedures depend on a precise match between donor and recipient genes to avoid rejection. For decades, doctors have used immunosuppressant drugs to lower the risk of rejection. But these drugs work broadly, suppressing the entire immune system. The MUSC team, led by Leonardo Ferreira, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Pharmacology and Immunology, showed the feasibility of targeted immunosuppression after transplant that could one day reduce rejection without leaving patients vulnerable to infection and other side effects. This strategy could also level the playing field for patients who have limited eligibility for organs because they are especially prone to rejection. Jaime Valentín-Quiroga, first author of the article and a Ph.D. candidate at University Hospital La Paz in Madrid, Spain, working in the lab of Eduardo Lopez Collazo, Ph.D., is also co-advised by Ferreira. Spain is one of the leading countries worldwide in organ transplantation and offers the perfect platform to move from bench to bedside. I am lucky to be co-advised by Dr. Ferreira. His research combines my favorite topics, fine-tuning the immune system and using cutting-edge biotechnology to enhance immune cells' natural functions." B-cells release antibodies that attack pathogens and infected cells. Regulatory T-cells, or Tregs, keep the immune response from going too far, preventing tissue damage and autoimmune diseases. "When you prick your finger, it is important to mount a strong immune response to kill all the bacteria that entered your finger," Ferreira said. A key target for B-cells are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins, which help the immune system to tell self from non-self. Doctors try to match donor and recipient HLA proteins as closely as possible, but with more than 40,000 HLA variants, perfect matches are rare. One variant, HLA-A2, is found in nearly one-third of the global population. These include previous transplant patients; women who, during pregnancy, carried a child with HLA-A2 inherited from their partners; and recipients of HLA-A2-positive blood transfusions. When CHARs detect and attach to B-cells secreting anti-HLA-A2 antibodies, they alert the Tregs to neutralize these problematic B-cells, essentially signaling the immune system to stand down and not attack the organ. "We took patients' cells that have been shown to make an extremely strong response against HLA-A2-expressing cells, and we showed that the novel CHAR-Tregs calmed them down," said Ferreira. "I think that's the most exciting part of our study – we show that this strategy works in the cells of actual pre-sensitized patients." Valentín-Quiroga, J., et al. (2025) Chimeric anti-HLA antibody receptor engineered human regulatory T cells suppress alloantigen-specific B cells from pre-sensitized transplant recipients.
