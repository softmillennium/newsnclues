                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Russian President Vladimir Putin met US President Donald Trump in Alaska, a video of their conversation after their joint press conference has gone viral. It showed the Russian leader's legs 'twitching suspiciously' as he bid farewell to Trump. The Kremlin footage showed Putin's knee jolting repeatedly as he stood in a corner talking to his US counterpart, along with a translator, flanked by security teams and aides. In the clip, the Russian leader kept dipping one knee as he stood beside Trump, making his legs appear wobbly, as he continued to raise his left toe and heel. While some accused him of wearing "hidden platforms" in his shoes due to a “Napoleon complex”, others claimed that he donned an "exoskeleton” to better his posture. On X, many began theorising that the twitching and “jelly legs” were caused by a "mysterious" health condition. The 72-year-old Putin with a swollen face is suffering from jelly legs (uncontrollable leg twitching)," claimed one user. Look at his body, almost convulsing, unable to stand still.” "I don't think a KGB Master Spy would shake his legs so much when standing. Many also pointed to Putin's absence of his usual “gunslinger gait.” The Russian leader usually walks with one arm still by his side and the other swinging, likely due to his KGB training, in which agents hold a gun close to themselves when walking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Exclusive, Horror, Interview, Movies | Tagged: The Avenue, Witchboard She's done her share of comedy, horror, action, and drama with memorable roles on ABC's Modern Family, Nickelodeon's Henry Danger, CMT's Still the King, Columbia/Sony's Jumanji franchise, New Line's Annabelle Comes Home (2019), Prime Video's TV adaptation of I Know What You Did Last Summer, and FX's American Horror Stories. Dominguez spoke to Bleeding Cool about working with horror legend writer-director Chuck Russell, giving Emily the depth required of her character, the over-the-top practical effects sequences, and working with co-stars Aaron Dominguez and Jamie Campbell Bower. What originally drew me to it so much was Chuck, who's been around forever. 'Dream Warriors' (1987) was one of my favorite films when growing up. He had all these incredible ideas, and it was something that I wanted to dive into. It was unlike anything that I had done before. What was it about Chuck's script that stood out to you? There are cats all over the whole thing, which I'm a huge cat lady. I was jumping at the opportunity to work with cats, but other than that, it was a fun acting challenge. She's grounded, curious, and starts to get her life back together, and then she goes through this wave of emotions as she finds this board and gets enthralled with it, possessed by it, and without giving anything away, then somehow becomes a bit of a different person. So, reading it from the perspective of an actor, there was a lot to jump into that made me excited, and a lot of elements that I haven't gotten to do yet in my career. I was wondering about that bed sequence with the multiple hands coming from below. How do you prep yourself to deal with that and go through the motions? When I talked to Chuck early on, I brought up a lot of these scenes written on the page that were a bit larger than life, and one of my questions was, "How are we planning on tackling half of these things?" What makes Chuck so great is the practical effects, and he had all these crazy ideas about how we were going to get through them. The Hands was a big one because, written on page, it reads one way, but then you're like, "How do you pull this off?" I remember that day we showed up, he had a whole rig set up where they cut holes into the bottom of the mattress. We had about eight stunt people underneath me, choreographed the whole thing to where they stuck their hands through, and it was such a well-oiled machine from all the practical effects they did. There was a board underneath that would drop through whenever I needed to fall into the water. We would bounce off each other a bit, and he would get excited when I got excited, and so we were a match made in heaven. Was there any other sequence that stood out, and you might have had a hard time with? It was so beautifully done, but that was one of those things I remember reading it on the page, being like, "Okay, this is going to be a feat to get through." The fun part about that sequence is I'm standing off to the edge, which ended up being so great, because I was able to watch everyone do their incredible work and see it from the side. That was probably one of the most impressive sequences I got to witness, our whole time filming. What'd you like about working with Aaron and Jamie on set? They both have become such good friends of mine. They're both so sweet, and some of the most present actors I've ever worked with. Aaron's been such a dear friend, and he's so good as Christian. He's so grounded and brings our movie home, which is what I love so much about his character, because we're all these larger-than-life people in these larger-than-life experiences. He had all the exposition in our film, so no one else could do it better than Jamie, explaining all these crazy instances we're going through. Also, more than anything, we just had such a good time. There are some moments when we're doing the most insane things possible, and all you can do is laugh and have a good time. It's crazy because we filmed this so long ago, around 2023. The Avenue and Highland's Witchboard, which also stars Melanie Jarnson, Charlie Tahan, and Antonia Desplat, comes to theaters on August 15th.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He holds a degree in graphic design from the Kent Institute of Art and Design at Kent University, a post graduate certificate of education from Goldsmiths, at the University of London, as well as a master's degree and a doctorate in art history from Open University. "As a historian, you only work with secondary source material," Lee said. "With all that information, you have an educated guess as to what took place in the era (as) we weren't actually there. It was remarkable for me as a historian to realize that you could have a conversation with someone that died 150 years ago and you can ask them what it was like." Lee spoke to a sold out crowd on Saturday night at the Iowa State Fair in an event titled "Ghost Hunting 101: How to be a Paranormal Investigator." Though he has conducted paranormal investigations around the world, most of Lee's recent work has been focused in and around the Midwest, with many episodes of his show "Unscripted Paranormal" shot in Iowa. The State Fair was the pefect place for a hunt, Lee said, as fairgrounds tend to retain lots of spiritual energy. Certain attire is strictly prohibited, according to Lee's rule book. Patterned clothing could be picked up by specialized cameras and cause a false positive. Light from flash photography can bounce off of jewelry, resulting in the same outcome. They talked the crowd through the technology behind electromagnetic field readers, spirit boxes — also known as electronic voice phenomena devices — and structured light sensor cameras. Newer voice recorders come with settings installed that function to filter out the background noise. A key part of paranormal investigations is patience, according to Lee. "If you put yourself in the right place at the right time, law of averages, you'll start to see (ghosts,)", Lee said. "But during a person's everyday life, I mean, very rarely have I seen a ghost outside of my investigating...I think an average person's life wouldn't take them to where a ghost would perhaps exist." Lee also professed psychic ability to the crowd gathered in Pioneer Hall, saying much of his communication with the spirit realm comes in the form of mental images, which he then transcribes. Lee said this psychic ability allows him to feel a physical empathy for the spirits with whom he speaks. “If your grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis, I'll feel my fingers start to get stiff,” Lee said. Everyone has different things, but being psychic for me is almost like daydreaming.” Lee said all of his books are all backed by historical research, though he added, most of the time his first clue as to what to look for comes from interactions with the dead. As the event drew to a close, attendees walked out into the gathering darkness, sure to have a shiver or two running down their spine as they wove their way back out onto the fairgrounds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A strange object hurdling through our solar system from interstellar space may, according to one of academia's most controversial astronomers, have been sent by aliens to see how smart we are. While most astronomers, including those at NASA, believe it to be a comet, Harvard's resident alien-hunter Avi Loeb has repeatedly suggested that it was sent to us by an extraterrestrial civilization — and may even function as something of a "Turing Test" for humanity. "It is well known to any interstellar traveler that there are plenty of icy rocks in planetary systems," Loeb wrote. "For that reason, an alien might assume that any intelligent observer on Earth must be familiar with space rocks as they impact the Earth on a regular basis," he continued, before advising: "Not so fast." Citing "terrestrial comet expert" Chris Lintott of Oxford, who insisted last month that Loeb's alien-origin theory is "nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object," the Harvard alien hunter suggested that any extraterrestrial being who encountered such dismissals could "justifiably conclude that humans failed the test and do not deserve a high status in the class of intelligent civilizations within the Milky-Way galaxy." As the Harvard astronomer has contended, the scientific establishment at large may have gotten it wrong by immediately declaring 3I/ATLAS to be a comet. He pointed out new Hubble Space Telescope images of the object to back up his claim, which show a "glow" ahead of it, but "no prominent cometary tail behind it, as is the case for common comets." To Loeb, there is one predominant alternative explanation about the origins of 3I/ATLAS if it's not a comet: that it's "a technological object which targets the inner solar system," and even perfectly times its "arrival time" for "a close encounter with Mars, Venus and Jupiter." Obviously, in a Universe as vast and unknowable as our own, there are other, non-alien explanations for all those anomalous properties seen in 3I/ATLAS. To test his alien-origin theory out, Loeb has another, even more provocative proposal: sending a Morse code message to 3I/ATLAS, and seeing if anything (or anyone) responds. As easy as it may be to dismiss Loeb's constant stream of strange alien claims, he does offer a fascinating alternate look at space rocks, and his notion that "3I/ATLAS is a blind date of interstellar proportions" is indeed pretty romantic to consider. "As an optimist, I prefer to approach it with a positive mindset," Loeb wrote of the interstellar object.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Cregger's horror thriller Weapons turned into a surprise crowd-puller and critical favorite. All thanks to its unsettling blend of mystery, gore, and psychological dread. Fronted by Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, and Amy Madigan, the movie dives into a small town terrorized after 17 children inexplicably abandon their homes one night. They later vanish into the woods as if under a spell. The culprit, a parasitic evil with an appetite for human life, eventually faces destruction. But the chaos it leaves behind is laced with unanswered puzzles. And like any good genre hit, those loose ends are the ones people can't stop talking about. Dream sequences in horror films usually scream “symbolism,” and Weapons delivered one that viewers haven't stopped dissecting. Talking to Variety, he admitted, “It's a very important moment for me in this movie, and to be frank with you, I think what I love about it so much is that I don't understand it. I like the idea that everyone is probably going to have their own kind of interaction or their own relationship with that scene, whether they don't give a shit about it and it's boring, or whether they think it's some sort of political statement, or whether they think it's just cool.” The sequence exists more as a provocation, the kind of surreal imagery that pushes an audience into debate without handing them a conclusion. just got out of weapons but I keep thinking to myself, what was the purpose of the floating gun above the dads house and it showing 217… like that was so random and not elaborated on at all #WeaponsMovie #Weapons If anyone walked out of the theater unsure about who or what Aunt Gladys really was, that's exactly how Cregger wanted it. Her powers don't come from a normal source; she thrives by siphoning the life force of others. Early drafts reportedly gave her an entire backstory chapter, but Cregger scrapped it in favor of ambiguity. The result is a character who feels ancient, almost mythological, without ever being explained outright. Her presence ties into the central theme of parasitism, like how evil feeds, grows, and refuses to die unless completely burned out. I can't stop thinking about Aunt Gladys character design pic.twitter.com/aEnziiwRoq Covered in cryptic markings, the bell becomes her most lethal tool. It is not just an accessory, but the key to unleashing possession. Its engravings include an inverted triangle and the number six, both steeped in occult history. This was Gladys' weapon, a ritual device meant to seal curses once she brewed them. That small adjustment may hint at something alchemical, a nod to potions and transformations. Like much of Weapons, the bell leaves audiences piecing together lore from scraps, a mystery preserved by design. One that may be explored further if the rumored prequel plans come to fruition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Residents of upstate New York were recently met with an unusual sight — a bright white light in the night sky with a strange-looking aura. A number of area residents posted about the sighting on social media, with several speculating it might be a UFO, according to the New York Post. It launched with four side-mounted rocket boosters in order to send the satellite directly into geosynchronous orbit. Additionally, it was the U.S. military's first experimental navigation satellite to be launched in 48 years, per Space.com. The spacecraft is designed to provide data similar to that of a GPS system and will test a variety of new technologies.
