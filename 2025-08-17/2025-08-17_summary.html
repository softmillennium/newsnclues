WASHINGTON, August 17. /TASS/. The United States believes that the European leaders are coming to Washington not to "keep Vladimir Zelensky from being bullied" into a bad deal, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

"This is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because Trump is going to bully Zelensky into a bad deal. We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come," Rubio told CBS.

"They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelensky from being bullied," Rubio said. "They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the UK over the previous weekend."

On August 15, a meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump took place at a military base in Alaska. The rendezvous lasted about three hours: there was a one-on-one discussion in the American leader's limousine on the way to the main venue for the talks and a narrow "three-on-three" meeting. The Russian side was also represented by Presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the American side was represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

In a statement to the press following the talks, Putin said that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and returning to cooperation, and invited Trump to Moscow. For his part, the US president announced the progress made in the talks, but noted that the parties had not managed to reach agreement.

After returning to Washington, Trump held a phone call with Vladimir Zelensky and later with the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland, and France, as well as with the NATO secretary general and the European Commission president. Later, Zelensky said that he would travel to Washington on Monday to discuss details of a potential peace deal with Trump. According to The New York Time, Trump also invited the European leaders to join.

President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff — one of three American participants in Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin — described on Sunday several major agreements reached during the Alaska talks that he said created strong momentum toward a peace agreement with Ukraine.
    


            Witkoff told CNN that Putin had signed off on allowing “robust” security guarantees as part of an eventual peace accord, including a provision that would provide for a collective defense of Ukraine by the United States and Europe should Russia attempt another invasion.
    


            “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as game changing,” Witkoff told Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” adding the Russians had also pledged “legislative enshrinement” of a promise not to invade Ukraine or another European country in any forthcoming peace plan.
    


            Neither provision has been mentioned in Russian accounts of the summit.
    


            Witkoff's public description of Friday's summit was the most fulsome yet of what was discussed for nearly three hours behind closed doors in Anchorage. Trump will meet Monday at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and several European leaders to discuss the matter in more detail.
    


            Still, many questions remained about how the US is assessing Putin's seriousness about reaching a deal, whether his promises can be trusted after a track record of violating previous peace agreements and what exactly Trump is willing to offer to ensure Ukraine isn't invaded again.
    


            Heading into Friday's meeting, Trump said he would be disappointed if a ceasefire wasn't reached and threatened “severe” consequences on Russia if Putin didn't end the fighting.
    


            But as he departed, Trump said he was no longer aiming for an immediate ceasefire and declared “we don't have to think” about sanctions after the talks.
    


            Witkoff said significant progress during the summit led Trump to abandon his push for an immediate ceasefire and instead work toward advancing a larger peace agreement.
    


            “We made so much progress at this meeting with regard to all the other ingredients necessary for a for a peace deal that we, that President Trump, pivoted to that place,” Witkoff said.
    


            The other US participant in the talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offered a more guarded assessment of how close a peace agreement may be.
    


            “We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off,” he said on ABC's “This Week.” “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement, we're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made.”
    


            He said later on CBS' “Face the Nation” that any agreement to end the war would cause disappointment on both sides.
    


            “It may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end to the war, there are things that Russia wants that it cannot get and there are things that Ukraine wants that it's not going to get,” he said.
    


            The agreements Witkoff described will be at the center of meetings Monday between Trump and Zelensky. A large delegation of European officials — including the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, the European Union and NATO — will accompany the Ukrainian leader for the talks.
    


            European leaders have been pressing Trump to follow through on his threat of tough new economic penalties on Russia, but Rubio cautioned such steps could scuttle progress on a peace deal.
    


            “The minute he takes those steps, all talks stop,” he said. “The minute we take those steps, there is no one left in the world to go talk to the Russians and try to get them to the table to reach a peace agreement.”
    


            A breakout session during Monday's talks at the White House will explore options for security guarantees for Ukraine that would ensure Russia is unable to re-invade the country once a peace deal is in place. Zelensky and European leaders have said such assurances are necessary as part of a peace accord.
    


            Witkoff said the clause agreed to by Russia — akin to NATO's “Article 5” agreement that an attack against one country is an attack against all — was a workaround for Russia's insistence Ukraine never be able to join NATO.
    


            He described it as the “first time we had ever heard the Russians agree” to such a provision being included in a peace deal.
    


            What the United States would contribute to the effort — versus the the Europeans — remained unclear. Trump has previously stated clearly that American troops won't be on the ground in Ukraine, and has said the onus is on European nations to take the lead in protecting it.
    


            Some officials believe a robust security infrastructure for Ukraine could make it easier for Zelensky to accept some of Russia's demands for land concessions as part of a peace deal.
    


            Putin has not abandoned some of his maximalist ideas, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donbas region, where Russia currently occupies large swaths of territory.
    


            But Witkoff said Putin did make some concessions on his land requirements, suggested the Russians now see “land swapping” occurring at the current frontlines of the war rather than the administrative boundaries of at least some of the five regions long in Putin's sights.
    


            “The Russians made some concessions at the table with regard to all five of those regions,” he said, adding the issue would be discussed with Zelensky on Monday and “hopefully we can cut through and make some decisions right then and there.”

            Terence Stamp, the British actor who became synonymous with Swinging London in the 1960s, has died, his family said Sunday, according to Reuters. He was 87 years old.
    


            Stamp first came to prominence when he took on the titular role in the 1962 film “Billy Budd.” The black and white drama, directed by Peter Ustinov, who also starred, saw Stamp nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor - the only Oscar nomination of his lengthy career.
    


            He went on to star in a host of films in the 1960s, among them John Schlesinger's Thomas Hardy adaptation “Far From the Madding Crowd” and Ken Loach's first feature film, “Poor Cow.”
    


            CNN has reached out to his representatives for confirmation of his death.
    


            He was a star who rose from humble beginnings in London's East End, about as far from Hollywood as you can get. He was born on July 22, 1938, to parents Ethel and Thomas, a merchant seaman.
    


            In a 2013 interview with the British Film Institute (BFI), Stamp revealed that his father tried to deter him from a career in showbiz.
    


            “He genuinely believed that people like us didn't do things like that,” he said. But his mother, he said, “loved every second of it.”
    


            “In retrospect, my mother must have always wanted me to do it and must have wished that she could have been more supportive. But my dad was the head of the family and I never really knew what he thought of it because he was of that generation.
    


            “He was a merchant seaman, he shovelled coal, and in that confined living quarters any show of emotion would have been considered unbearably flash.”
    


            Stamp would become one of the biggest figures of 1960s London, romantically linked to model Jean Shrimpton and actresses Julie Christie - his “Far From the Madding Crowd” co-star - and Brigitte Bardot.
    


            His only marriage came in 2002 - to an Australian pharmacist 35 years his junior - but that lasted just six years, according to the Guardian.
    


            Stamp famously roomed with fellow actor Michael Caine, who was also a rising star at the time. The pair lost touch, however, as he disclosed in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2015.
    


            “We just went different ways. I can understand it: in many ways he was much more mature than me,” he said of Caine, who was five years older.
    


            “Caine gave me all my early values, like making sure you were doing good stuff, waiting for the right things – then as soon as he got away he did exactly the opposite. Went from one movie to another.”
    


            After a few years away from the screen, Stamp appeared in the 1978 blockbuster “Superman” as the superhero's adversary, General Zod. He reprised the role of the comic book villain in the sequel two years later.
    


            Ironically, more than two decades later Stamp went on to voice the role of Superman's father Jor-El in the TV series “Smallville.”
    


            His many screen credits also included his role as drag queen Bernadette in the 1990s Australian comedy “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.”
    


            Of his eclectic career - including roles in Hollywood's “Wall Street” and “The Adjustment Bureau” - he told the Guardian that he had no ambitions, adding: “I've had bad experiences and things that didn't work out; my love for film sometimes diminishes but then it just resurrects itself.
    


            “I never have to gee myself up, or demand a huge wage to get out of bed in the morning. I've done crap, because sometimes I didn't have the rent. But when I've got the rent, I want to do the best I can.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff on Aug. 17 said that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed at Friday's Alaska peace summit to allow U.S. and European allies to grant Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an impending deal to end the war.

“We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” Witkoff said on CNN's “State of the Union.”

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) carried out a drone strike on Russian military logistics in the Voronezh region overnight, damaging infrastructure at a key transportation hub, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 17.

The operation was conducted together with Ukraine's State Border Guard Service and other units of the Armed Forces, the source said. 

The strike disrupted train traffic through the Lisky station, halting the supply of ammunition and troops to aid Russian forces fighting on Ukrainian territory, according to the source.

HUR described Lisky station as a key transportation hub for Russian military logistics.

Earlier on Aug. 17, Russian independent outlet Astra published footage purportedly showing a fire at the station following the attack. 

Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev confirmed a drone strike on a railway station in the region, though he did not name it. 

Gusev said a railway worker was injured, a power line was damaged, and several trains were delayed. Gusev added that the worker had been hospitalized and that train movement had since been restored. He also reported fires at a market, a store, and a gas pipeline in separate incidents in the region.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 46 Ukrainian drones overnight across several oblasts, including 16 over Belgorod Oblast, 14 over Nizhny Novgorod, nine over Voronezh Oblast, three over Bryansk Oblast, and one each over Kursk, Oryol, Kaluga, and Smolensk oblasts.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also backed "Article 5-like security guarantees" for Ukraine, saying the country must become "a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders."

First face-to-face meeting between Russian President Putin and U.S. President Trump since the latter's second term to the major push of Russian forces in the embattled Donetsk Oblast.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told journalists on Aug. 17.

According to the German government, the discussions will cover the state of peace efforts, security guarantees, territorial questions, continued support for Ukraine, and maintaining sanctions pressure.

The General Staff said Russian forces suffered significant losses in the area, including 910 killed, 335 wounded, and 37 captured. 

According to the presidential decree, restrictions were introduced against 39 Russian nationals and 55 companies from Russia, China, and Belarus. 

The Air Force said Russia launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile and 60 Shahed-type attack drones and drone decoys overnight on Aug. 17. 

The number includes 900 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Ukraine's military has reportedly advanced about two kilometers in Sumy oblast, just a day after Putin and Trump discussed a deal that would give unoccupied Ukrainian territories to Russia.

In an Aug. 16 video, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico praised the recent Putin-Trump summit in Alaska and repeated Kremlin propaganda about the "root causes" of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"If they do not have the will to implement a simple order to stop the attacks, it may take a great deal of effort to get Russia to implement something much more significant, namely peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades to come."

"Ultimately it is Russia's responsibility to end its blatant violations of international law. Russia's aggression and imperialist ambitions are the root causes of this war," the Nordic-Baltic Eight said after Putin's meeting with Trump. 



The documents disclose the exact locations and meeting times of the summit and phone numbers of U.S. government staff. They also reveal other sensitive details, such as a menu for a luncheon in honor of "His Excellency Vladimir Putin." 

Trump appeared to endorse Russia's plan as the fastest way to a peace deal, abandoning the demand for a ceasefire and threats of sanctions agains Moscow, officials told the NYT.

            Large crowds of Israelis took to the streets on Sunday, launching a nationwide grassroots strike and widespread protests to demand the government secure the release of 50 hostages still in Gaza.
    


            In one of the largest coordinated demonstrations since the beginning of the Gaza war nearly two years ago, protesters blocked major roads, closed private businesses, and staged rallies in big cities.
    


            People also protested outside government minister's homes. Organizers estimated that hundreds of thousands took part in the strike across Israel.
    


            The day of protests began at 06:29am, the exact time when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel on October 7.
    


            Family members of the hostages, leading the strike alongside the October Council, which represents bereaved families from the war, held a press conference in Tel Aviv, announcing an “emergency break” until the hostages are released.
    


            “Today, we stop everything to save the lives of 50 hostages and soldiers. Today, we stop everything to remember the supreme value of the sanctity of life,” said Anat Engrest, whose son Matan, is held hostage in Gaza.
    


            Polls have repeatedly shown a large majority in Israel support a ceasefire deal to release all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war. The last round of negotiations fell apart in late-July, when the US and Israel withdrew their teams from talks in Doha, accusing Hamas of not negotiating in good faith.
    


            “We are united in one simple demand directed at the Israeli government: Put an Israeli proposal on the table today for a comprehensive deal - to end the war in exchange for the return of the last hostage. No slogans, no sabotage, no demands that we know the other side won't accept,” said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod, is a hostage. “It's time to end the horrific nightmare the entire country has been living in for 22 months.”
    


            The strike was announced last week, following the Israeli security cabinet's decision to expand the war and take over Gaza City, despite the Israeli military's warning that the operations could endanger the 50 remaining hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.
    


            The Israeli military says the operation will begin “soon” and the government says it will provide the local population with tents before relocating them “for their protection.” Almost the entire population in Gaza has been displaced, with many forced to move multiple times.
    


            As of early Sunday afternoon, Israeli police say 38 protesters had been arrested across the country for disturbing the peace.
    


            Israel's largest labor organization, the Histadrut, did not join the strike, though it encouraged employers to let workers participate. But many technology companies, law firms, academic institutions and private sector enterprises announced their participation and support, alongside citizens who declared they would take the day off or refrain from business transactions.
    


            Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed support for the hostage families, while visiting the central gathering at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. “All of the people of Israel are anxious, concerned, and want the hostages to come home. There is not a single Israeli woman or man who does not want them home,” Herzog said.
    


            But members of the Israeli government slammed the day of protests.
    


            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting: “Those who are calling today to end the war without defeating Hamas not only harden Hamas's stance and delay the release of our hostages – they are also ensuring that the horrors of October 7 will repeat themselves again and again.”
    


            Itamar Ben Gvir, the far-right Minister of National Security, said the strike was a “cynical political maneuver on the backs of the hostages,” linking it to long-standing anti-government protest movement.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most of the hostages who remain in Gaza, said in response: “You can continue to hide behind spins and political calculations, but you cannot escape responsibility.”
    


            The Forum announced plans to set up a protest encampment on the Gaza border called “Waypoint 50” – representing the 50 hostages – to continue pressuring the government to secure their release.

Union to challenge order issued less than 12 hours after start of action that has left more than 100,000 travellers stranded

Air Canada's flight attendants plan to remain on strike, their union has said, defying government efforts to force them back to work and into binding arbitration over a dispute that has left more than 100,000 travellers stranded around the world during the peak summer travel season.

About 10,000 flight attendants who work for Canada's largest airline walked out on the job early on Saturday amid a bitter dispute over what the union has described as “poverty wages” and unpaid labour.

Around the same time, Air Canada, which operates about 700 flights a day, said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.

Less than 12 hours later, the Canadian government said it had ordered an end to the work stoppage, leading Air Canada to announce plans to resume flying by Sunday evening. However, that timeline was thrown into question after the union told Reuters it would challenge the return-to-work order, which it described as unconstitutional.

It was the latest twist in talks that have dragged on since March as the flight attendants seek to address the fact that they are not compensated for work carried out when planes are not in the air such as time spent on the ground between flights or helping passengers to board.

On Saturday, Canada's federal jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, said it was clear the talks had reached an impasse and that the impact was being felt by Canadians and visitors across the country.

“The talks broke down,” said Hajdu as she told reporters that she had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order an immediate end to the strike and to impose binding arbitration. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”

She appeared to link her actions to the toll that US tariff increases had taken on the Canadian economy. “In a year in which Canadian families and businesses have already experienced too much disruption and uncertainty, this is not the time to add additional challenges and disruptions to their lives and our economy,” she said in a statement.

Hajdu's power to halt the strike stems from a section of the Canada Labour Code, which gives the minister unilateral authority to end work stoppages in order to “maintain or secure industrial peace”. While the section was rarely used by previous governments, the Liberal government has invoked it several times in the past year, quelling strikes by workers at Canadian ports, the post office and railway companies. Analysts have voiced concerns that the use of the clause may be undermining workers' rights.

The union representing the flight attendants decried the Liberal government for stepping in within hours, accusing it of violating their right to take job action. Air Canada had reportedly previously requested that the government intervene to impose binding arbitration.

Wesley Lesosky, of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the government was giving “Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation”.

According to the aviation analytics firm Cirium, the airline had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, leaving some travellers stranded overseas and others scrambling to find alternatives during the busy summer travel season. About 130,000 customers a day could be affected by a disruption, according to the airline.

The airline said earlier it had offered its flight attendants “an increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the union said the figure failed to fully account for inflation. Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully compensated for their labour.

About 70% of the airline's flight attendants are women, said Natasha Stea, a local union president and flight attendant. She questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada pilots, the vast majority of whom are men, received a significant raise last year.

“We are heartbroken for our passengers,” she told the Associated Press late last week. “Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans, but we cannot work for free.”

Air Canada flight attendants will defy an order that they end their strike and return to their jobs after the federal government issued a back-to-work order, according to a statement from the Canadian Union of Public Employees.

The company said Sunday morning it would resume flights after the Canada Industrial Relations Board directed the airline and striking flight attendants to resume service operations for all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights at 2 p.m. ET.

However, the Air Canada component of CUPE, which represents the striking workers, said in a statement it will be “challenging this blatantly unconstitutional order that violates the Charter rights of 10,000 flight attendants.”

“We remain on strike. We demand a fair, negotiated contract and to be compensated for all hours worked,” the statement read.

Outside of Toronto Pearson International Airport, union executives insisted the strikers won't back down.

“This is a completely legal strike, with legal protests happening until 2 p.m. At that point, we will carry forward with the demonstrations. We're asking that the company come back to the table and deal with it,” said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada component of CUPE.

He said the only communication from the company Sunday was when it asked if the union had issued the directive to its membership.

While Air Canada has not updated its earlier statement that flights would begin to resume Sunday evening, “I can't see how flights can resume without flight attendants,” he said. 

“This ends when we say it's over, because we have something happening at the table,” he said.

Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the federal government issued a directive to end a cabin crew strike, with one union official calling it "incredibly disgusting."

As he spoke, lines of striking workers walked in a circle, chanting, “Say it loud, say it proud, unpaid work is not allowed.” They carried signs bearing the CUPE union flags that read, “We love our passengers, not poverty pay,” and “Would you work for free?” Several cars honked and people cheered for the group as they drove by.

Even without the latest threat of continued strike action, the Montreal-based airline said the complete shutdown of service early Saturday, which left crews out of position for its flights, meant it would take at least a week to restore full operations. 

Air Canada warned further flight cancellations will occur over the next week as it resumes normal operations.

The company did not immediately respond to questions about CUPE's announcement. 

“Air Canada expects it will take several days before its operations return to normal. During this process, some flights will be cancelled over the next seven to ten days until the schedule is stabilized,” the statement said.

Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu had directed the labour board to order the parties to resume work and extend the terms of the existing collective agreement until a new one could be determined by an arbitrator.

At Pearson Airport, uncertainty over the status of the strike was causing confusion among passengers. 

Sabrina Marrati, 34, travelled for the first time to Canada from Italy for a two-week honeymoon with her husband. She was scheduled to fly to Calgary from Toronto early Sunday morning, but her flight was cancelled. Air Canada was unable to book the couple on another flight because they were all sold out, she said.

“We have no alternatives right now. We're just here waiting for another flight which might come, but we don't know yet,” she said, as she stood with her luggage by the exit door at Pearson airport.

She said the airline is telling passengers to remain at the airport, or accept a refund. But Ms. Marrati and her husband, who spent a week on the east coast, already have a tour and hotels booked for a week out west. The trip cost them a total of about 10,000 Euros, she said.

“Terrible experience right now,” she said.

The flight cancellations have also left passengers who are stranded around the world furious at the lack of communication from the airline about the status of their tickets.

Lisa Pasquin's extended family has been on a two-week trip to Greece that was supposed to end Sunday with a flight back to Toronto.

Other than a single message from the airline last Friday advising her to wait before taking any action on her tickets, the Toronto resident didn't hear anything until Sunday at 1 a.m. Athens time, well after the strike had started, when Air Canada informed her the flight was cancelled.

In a text message to Ms. Pasquin, the airline said it searched for flights “on over 120 airlines for three days before and after” her cancelled flight but was “unable” to rebook her.

However, Ms. Pasquin had conducted her own search earlier, and found an alternate flight home, albeit by way of transfers at London's Heathrow airport and Newark, New Jersey, where the family must spend the night.

All told, she's out “thousands and thousands of dollars.” 

“I never in my wildest dreams imagined the response from Air Canada would be, ‘sorry, no flights, good luck,” said Ms. Pasquin, who holds Aeroplan Elite Status in the airline's loyalty program. “The company has shown an appalling disregard for both our emotional and financial wellbeing.” 

While union members picketed outside Toronto's Pearson Airport on Saturday, frustrated travellers inside huddled against banded barriers, waiting to speak with Air Canada representatives on the other side. Some sat in corners or against walls with stacked baggage carts. Others seemed frantic on laptops or on their phones, looking for accommodation or alternate flights, as demand, and prices, surged.

Drew Smith said he and his family drove two hours to Pearson to catch a flight to B.C. Saturday morning, only to find out that it had been cancelled.

“We're expected to be at work on Monday,” said Mr. Smith, of Kamloops, B.C., who was travelling with his wife and their kids. He said the children were being chauffeured around the area by their grandfather, to save them from the tension inside the airport.

Abigail Jackson's flight to Nanaimo, B.C., where she was expecting to pick up an RV from storage, was also cancelled.

Ms. Jackson said she went to the airport on Friday, hoping to find a solution ahead of the strike, and was told that her Saturday flight was still scheduled to depart.

“Four different Air Canada representatives have said different answers to me in the last couple hours we've been here,” she said Saturday. Calls to Air Canada did not go through, she added.

The CIRB's decision ordered the airline and its flight attendants to resume duties and “to continue such operations and duties until the final binding interest arbitration is completed.”

The union's counsel had argued the Board needs to delay imposing the ministerial order to allow time to issue an injunction against it with the federal court. 

“We're dealing with an exceptional situation,” Benjamin Piper, counsel for the union, said Saturday night, adding that the order was used “to override a legal and authorized and constitutionally protected right to strike.”

Air Canada counsel argued it needs to implement Ms. Hajdu's order as quickly as possible, as it does not have jurisdiction to pause a ministerial order, including to await a federal court proceeding.

Christopher Pigott, counsel for Air Canada, said the Board was tasked with “getting Air Canada operating again to assist the thousands of people who are literally sitting in airports, in Canada, around the world, who are stranded.”

The board later decided to impose the order, also extending the terms of the existing collective agreement retroactive to when it expired and until a new agreement between the parties comes into effect.

The ruling follows a decision reached between both parties allowing flight attendants 12 hours to prepare after the order is issued, to ensure they are mentally and physically fit to prepare to work – meaning not fatigued or under the influence of alcohol or drugs – and to arrange child care. 

Also during the hearing late Saturday, Mr. Piper argued that board chair Maryse Trembley should recuse herself from the case because of her past connection to Air Canada, creating legal grounds for a reasonable apprehension of bias.

Ms. Tremblay said she was in-house counsel for Air Canada from 1998 to 2004, and later represented Air Canada in labour and human rights proceedings. She last represented Air Canada in a human rights matter in May, 2022.

In a decision made during the tribunal hearing, the board dismissed the union's assertions.

Airlines work to add flights, make schedule adjustments in face of Air Canada labour dispute

The airline had been winding down operations since Thursday in response to the union's strike notice, coming to a complete halt on Saturday when more than 10,000 airline flight attendants walked off the job and began picketing at major airports across Canada.

As of Friday evening, Air Canada had cancelled 623 flights, impacting more than 100,000 travellers. 

The company said customers whose flights were cancelled, who did not travel and did not accept a refund or credit, will be contacted with new itineraries.

The EU and UK should not overestimate their influence on the settlement of the Ukraine conflict as the US will continue to play the leading role in the peace process with Russia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, met in Alaska on Friday for their first face-to-face encounter since 2018. Possible ways to resolve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine topped the agenda during the negotiations. Trump then held a phone call with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and the leaders of several Western European countries which are backing Kiev, including Merz, to inform them about his discussions with Putin.

The German chancellor told broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that “the talks have begun” on settling the Ukraine conflict, which escalated in February 2022.

“They will continue on Monday [when Zelensky is expected to arrive in Washington for a meeting with Trump], and of course, the Europeans will play a role,” he said.

However, Merz warned that Western Europe “must not overestimate ourselves. European unity is important, but the decisive role in this war will continue to be played by the US.”

Trump “has the power, both militarily and with appropriate sanctions, to influence Russia,” he claimed.

The “good news” that came from the Alaska summit is that “there are no territorial negotiations between Putin and Trump over the heads of Ukraine and the Europeans,” the chancellor added.

In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump insisted that Zelensky should “make the deal,” stressing that Putin “wants to see it done” and urging Western Europe to “get involved a little bit.”

Putin reiterated on Saturday that the elimination of the root causes of the crisis is key to the settlement of the conflict. According to Moscow, in order for lasting peace to be achieved, Ukraine should renounce its ambitions for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the current territorial realities.

BELGRADE, August 17. /TASS/. Mass riots took place late on Saturday night in a number of cities in Serbia, rioters attacked police officers, set fire to and destroyed offices of government agencies and political parties, Serbia's Interior Minister Ivica Dacic stated.

According to the minister, the most complicated situation has been reported in the city of Valjevo, where up to 4,000 people participated in protest actions. The offices of the Serbian Progressive Party were vandalized and set on fire.

"Fortunately, there was no one inside [the premises]," Dacic said. "Given the fact that the facility serves both as a residential and office building where people reside, a fire could have endangered their lives."

According to the local police reports, some 1,300 people participated in protests across Belgrade and they cast Molotov cocktails at law enforcement officers.

Up to 500 protesters gathered in Novi Sad, where the 50-meter-long concrete roof above the entrance of the railway station in Serbia's second-largest city collapsed in 2024 killing 15 people.

"The police stepped in and restored public order in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Valjevo," Serbia's top interior official added.

According to him, a police officer was injured in Valjevo, while a total of 18 rioters were reported to be detained.

Protests gripped Serbia in November 2024, sparked by the Novi Sad railway station canopy collapse. The tragedy left 15 people dead. Protestors blame the government and demand snap parliamentary elections.

On Wednesday night, protests took place in several Serbian cities, accompanied by attacks on the premises of the ruling SPP and the Socialist Party of Serbia. Dacic said 27 police officers and more than 80 civilians were injured in the attacks that day. The largest number of victims were supporters of the SPP, who gathered at the local branches of the party.

According to the Interior Ministry, protesters threw stones and pyrotechnics at buildings, five official vehicles and 22 pieces of equipment were damaged. A total of 47 people were detained, 47 administrative and five criminal protocols were drawn up. One of the most serious incidents was the attack on the soldiers of the special forces Cobra by a group of about 100 people in Novi Sad. A warning shot was fired into the air to protect the military.

BERLIN, August 17. /TASS/. The governments of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer plan to decide on August 17 whether their leaders would be travelling to the United States for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, Germany's Bild daily reported.

According to Bild, the governments of Merz, Starmer and Macron intend on Sunday, August 17, to coordinate their actions and jointly decide whether who would exactly be travelling to the United States on August 18 fro Trump's meeting with Zelensky. However, such a decision requires an official invitation on behalf of the United States, according to Bild.

The daily reported that US President Trump offered Zelensky to invite European politicians to the United States, however, there were no official invitations extended as of yet. Bild added that European leaders seek to avoid a meeting intended solely for publicity.

AFP reported earlier citing the Elysee Palace that the `coalition of the willing' will convene a meeting via video link on August 17.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and French President Emmanuel Macron, who earlier announced that the members of the coalition will hold a conversation soon without disclosing the date, will get together for an online conversation at 3:00 p.m. local time (1:00 p.m. GMT) on Sunday. The three leaders will discuss "next steps as part of the discussion on peace in Ukraine."

The New York Times reported earlier, citing sources, that following his meeting with Putin, the US leader proposed negotiating a peace deal under which Ukraine would give up the rest of the Donbass region to Russia, including areas not liberated by Russian troops, in a phone call with European leaders. A ceasefire in the rest of Ukraine at present-day battlefronts and security guarantees, both for Kiev and Europe, would be offered in return.

On August 15, Putin and Trump met at the Elmendorf-Richardson military base in Alaska. Their talks lasted approximately three hours, including a one-on-one conversation in the American leader's limousine en route to the main negotiation venue, as well as a subsequent small-group discussion involving three participants on either side.

The Russian delegation included Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the American side was represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff. In a statement to the media following the talks, Putin said they mostly focused on resolving the Ukraine conflict.

Trump described his summit with Putin as "very productive." Later, he called Vladimir Zelensky, EU leaders, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. After the summit and the phone calls, Trump stated that Ukraine and Russia should go straight to agreeing on a final peace deal as he dropped his demand for a ceasefire.

Trump and Zelensky are due to have a meeting in the White House on August 18. The US leader said that if talks with Zelensky are a success, another meeting with Putin will be scheduled.

NEW YORK (AP) — Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump that the United States and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the war, a U.S. official said Sunday.

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, who took part in the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, said it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called it “game-changing.”

“We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” Witkoff told CNN's “State of the Union.” 

Witkoff offered few details on how such an arrangement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his deep-seated objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership, a step that Kyiv has long sought.

It was expected to be a key topic Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and major European leaders meet with Trump at the White House to discuss ending the 3 1/2-year conflict.

“BIG PROGRESS ON RUSSIA,” Trump said Sunday on social media. “STAY TUNED!”




Article 5, the heart of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance, says an armed attack against a member nation is considered an attack against them all.

What needed to be hammered out at this week's talks were the contours of any security guarantees, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also participated in the summit. Ukraine and European allies have pushed the U.S. to provide that backstop in any peace agreement to deter future attacks by Moscow.

“How that's constructed, what we call it, how it's built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that's what we'll be talking about over the next few days with our partners,” Rubio said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” 

It was unclear, however, whether Trump had fully committed to such a guarantee. Rubio said it would be “a huge concession.”

The comments shed new light on what was discussed in Alaska. Before Sunday, U.S. officials had offered few details even as both Trump and Putin said their meeting was a success.

Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty.”

“The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that would prevent them from — or that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels alongside Zelenskyy, applauded the news from the White House as a European coalition looks to set up a force to police any future peace in Ukraine.

“We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the ‘coalition of the willing' — including the European Union — is ready to do its share,” she said.

Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. for signaling that it was willing to support such guarantees but said much remained unclear.

“There are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do — and this is our main task: We need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO,” he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the substance of security guarantees to secure any peace arrangement will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label.

At the White House meeting, Macron said European leaders will ask the U.S. to back their plans to beef up Ukraine's armed forces with more training and equipment and deploy an allied force away from the front lines.

“We'll show this to our American colleagues, and we'll tell them, ‘Right, we're ready to do this and that, what are you prepared to do?'” Macron said. “That's the security guarantee.”

Witkoff and Rubio defended Trump's decision to abandon a push for a ceasefire, arguing that the Republican president had pivoted toward a full peace agreement because so much progress had been made at the summit.

“We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. “We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.”

Rubio, appearing on several TV news shows Sunday, said it would have been impossible to reach any truce Friday because Ukraine was not there.

“Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.”

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, also voiced caution on the progress made.

“We're still a long ways off,” he said. “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We're not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made towards one.”

Among the issues expected to dominate Monday's meeting: What concessions Zelenskyy might accept on territory.

In talks with European allies after the summit, Trump said Putin reiterated that he wants the key Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas, European officials said. It was unclear among those briefed whether Trump sees that as acceptable.

Witkoff said the Russians have made clear they want territory as determined by legal boundaries instead of the front lines where territory has been seized.

“There is an important discussion to be had with regard to Donetsk and what would happen there. And that discussion is going to specifically be detailed on Monday,” he said.

Zelenskyy has rejected Putin's demands that Ukraine give up the Donbas region, which Russia has failed to take completely, as a condition for peace.

In Brussels, the Ukrainian leader said any talks involving land must be based on current front lines, suggesting he will not abandon land that Russia has not taken.

“The contact line is the best line for talking, and the Europeans support this,” he said. “The constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible, impossible to give up territory or trade land.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — European and NATO leaders announced Sunday they will join President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington to present a united front in talks with President Donald Trump on ending Russia's war in Ukraine and firming up U.S. security guarantees now on the negotiating table.

Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Finland are rallying around the Ukrainian president after his exclusion from Trump's summit on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Their pledge to be at Zelenskyy's side at the White House on Monday is an apparent effort to ensure the meeting goes better than the last one in February, when Trump berated Zelenskyy in a heated Oval Office encounter.

“The Europeans are very afraid of the Oval Office scene being repeated and so they want to support Mr. Zelenskyy to the hilt,” said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France's military mission at the United Nations. 

“It's a power struggle and a position of strength that might work with Trump,” he said.

Putin agreed at his summit in Alaska with Trump that the U.S. and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union.”

It “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that,” said Witkoff, who called it “game-changing.”




Later, French President Emmanuel Macron said the European delegation will ask Trump to back plans they drafted to beef-up Ukraine's armed forces — already Europe's largest outside of Russia — with more training and equipment to secure any peace.

“We need a credible format for the Ukrainian army, that's the first point, and say — we Europeans and Americans — how we'll train them, equip them, and finance this effort in the long-term,” the French leader said.

The European-drafted plans also envision an allied force in Ukraine away from the front lines to reassure Kyiv that peace will hold and to dissuade another Russian invasion, Macron said. He spoke after a nearly two-hour video call Sunday with nations in Europe and further afield — including Canada, Australia and Japan — that are involved in the so-called “coalition of the willing.”

The “several thousand men on the ground in Ukraine in the zone of peace” would signal that “our fates are linked,” Macron said.

“This is what we must discuss with the Americans: Who is ready to do what?” Macron said. “Otherwise, I think the Ukrainians simply cannot accept commitments that are theoretical.” 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said earlier at a news conference in Brussels with Zelenskyy that “we welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine. And the ‘coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share.”

Macron said the substance of security guarantees will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label.

“A theoretical article isn't enough, the question is one of substance,” he said. “We must start out by saying that the first of the security guarantees for Ukraine is a strong Ukrainian army.”

Along with Von der Leyen and Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb also said they'll will take part in Monday's talks, as will secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, Mark Rutte.

The European leaders' support could help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal.

Neil Melvin, director of international security at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said European leaders are trying to “shape this fast-evolving agenda.” After the Alaska summit, the idea of a ceasefire appears all-but-abandoned, with the narrative shifting toward Putin's agenda of ensuring Ukraine does not join NATO or even the EU.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday that a possible ceasefire is “not off the table” but that the best way to end the war would be through a “full peace deal.”

Putin has implied that he sees Europe as a hindrance to negotiations. He has also resisted meeting Zelenskyy in person, saying that such a meeting can only take place once the groundwork for a peace deal has been laid.

Speaking to the press after his meeting with Trump, the Russian leader raised the idea that Kyiv and other European capitals could “create obstacles” to derail potential progress with “behind-the-scenes intrigue.”

For now, Zelenskyy offers the Europeans the “only way” to get into the discussions about the future of Ukraine and European security, says RUSI's Melvin.

However, the sheer number of European leaders potentially in attendance means the group will have to be “mindful” not to give “contradictory” messages, Melvin said.

“The risk is they look heavy-handed and are ganging up on Trump,” he added. “Trump won't want to be put in a corner.” 

Although details remain hazy on what Article 5-like security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe would entail for Ukraine, it could mirror NATO membership terms, in which an attack on one member of the alliance is seen as an attack on all.

Zelenskyy continues to stress the importance of both U.S. and European involvement in any negotiations.

“A security guarantee is a strong army. Only Ukraine can provide that. Only Europe can finance this army, and weapons for this army can be provided by our domestic production and European production. But there are certain things that are in short supply and are only available in the United States,” he said at the press conference Sunday alongside Von der Leyen.

Zelenskyy also pushed back against Trump's assertion — which aligned with Putin's preference — that the two sides should negotiate a complete end to the war, rather than first securing a ceasefire. Zelenskyy said a ceasefire would provide breathing room to review Putin's demands.

“It's impossible to do this under the pressure of weapons,” he said. “Putin does not want to stop the killing, but he must do it.”

The explosion at U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh-area plant has reignited debate about its future. The plant, part of a long-standing steelmaking tradition in the Mon Valley, faces uncertainty despite recent investments.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The fatal explosion last week at U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh-area coal-processing plant has revived debate about its future just as the iconic American company was emerging from a long period of uncertainty.

The fortunes of steelmaking in the U.S. — along with profits, share prices and steel prices — have been buoyed by years of friendly administrations in Washington that slapped tariffs on foreign imports and bolstered the industry's anti-competitive trade cases against China.

Most recently, President Donald Trump's administration postponed new hazardous air pollution requirements for the nation's roughly dozen coke plants, like Clairton, and he approved U.S. Steel's nearly $15 billion acquisition by Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel.

Nippon Steel's promised infusion of cash has brought vows that steelmaking will continue in the Mon Valley, a river valley south of Pittsburgh long synonymous with steelmaking.

“We're investing money here. And we wouldn't have done the deal with Nippon Steel if we weren't absolutely sure that we were going to have an enduring future here in the Mon Valley,” David Burritt, U.S. Steel's CEO, told a news conference the day after the explosion. ”You can count on this facility to be around for a long, long time.”




The explosion killed two workers and hospitalized 10 with a blast so powerful that it took hours to find two missing workers beneath charred wreckage and rubble. The cause is under investigation.

The plant is considered the largest coking operation in North America and, along with a blast furnace and finishing mill up the Monongahela River, is one of a handful of integrated steelmaking operations left in the U.S.

The explosion now could test Nippon Steel's resolve in propping up the nearly 110-year-old Clairton plant, or at least force it to spend more than it had anticipated.

Nippon Steel didn't respond to a question as to whether the explosion will change its approach to the plant. 

Rather, a spokesperson for the company said its “commitment to the Mon Valley remains strong” and that it sent “technical experts to work with the local teams in the Clairton Plant, and to provide our full support.”

Meanwhile, Burritt said he had talked to top Nippon Steel officials after the explosion and that “this facility and the Mon Valley are here to stay.”

U.S. Steel officials maintain that safety is their top priority and that they spend $100 million a year on environmental compliance at Clairton alone.

However, repairing Clairton could be expensive, an investigation into the explosion could turn up more problems, and an official from the United Steelworkers union said it's a constant struggle to get U.S. Steel to invest in its plants.

Besides that, production at the facility could be affected for some time. The plant has six batteries of ovens and two — where the explosion occurred — were damaged. Two others are on a reduced production schedule because of the explosion. 

There is no timeline to get the damaged batteries running again, U.S. Steel said.

Accidents are nothing new at Clairton, which heats coal to high temperatures to make coke, a key component in steelmaking, and produces combustible gases as byproducts.

An explosion in February injured two workers.

Even as Nippon Steel was closing the deal in June, a breakdown at the plant dealt three days of a rotten egg odor into the air around it from elevated hydrogen sulfide emissions, the environmental group GASP reported.

The Breathe Project, a public health organization, said U.S. Steel has been forced to pay $57 million in fines and settlements since Jan. 1, 2020, for problems at the Clairton plant.

A lawsuit over a Christmas Eve fire at the Clairton plant in 2018 that saturated the area's air for weeks with sulfur dioxide produced a withering assessment of conditions there. 

An engineer for the environmental groups that sued wrote that he “found no indication that U.S. Steel has an effective, comprehensive maintenance program for the Clairton plant.”

The Clairton plant, he wrote, is “inherently dangerous because of the combination of its deficient maintenance and its defective design.”

U.S. Steel settled, agreeing to spend millions on upgrades.

Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, said U.S. Steel has shown more willingness to spend money on fines, lobbying the government and buying back shares to reward shareholders than making its plants safe.

It's not clear whether Nippon Steel will change Clairton.

Central to Trump's approval of the acquisition was Nippon Steel's promises to invest $11 billion into U.S. Steel's aging plants and to give the federal government a say in decisions involving domestic steel production, including plant closings. 

But much of the $2.2 billion that Nippon Steel has earmarked for the Mon Valley plants is expected to go toward upgrading the finishing mill, or building a new one.

For years before the acquisition, U.S. Steel had signaled that the Mon Valley was on the chopping block. 

That left workers there uncertain whether they'd have jobs in a couple years and whispering that U.S. Steel couldn't fill openings because nobody believed the jobs would exist much longer.

In many ways, U.S. Steel's Mon Valley plants are relics of steelmaking's past. 

In the early 1970s, U.S. steel production led the world and was at an all-time high, thanks to 62 coke plants that fed 141 blast furnaces. Nobody in the U.S. has built a blast furnace since then, as foreign competition devastated the American steel industry and coal fell out of favor. 

Now, China is dominant in steel and heavily invested in coal-based steelmaking. In the U.S., there are barely a dozen coke plants and blast furnaces left, as the country's steelmaking has shifted to cheaper electric arc furnaces that use electricity, not coal. 

Blast furnaces won't entirely go away, analysts say, since they produce metals that are preferred by automakers, appliance makers and oil and gas exploration firms.

Still, Christopher Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Social and Urban Research, questioned whether the Clairton plant really will survive much longer, given its age and condition. It could be particularly vulnerable if the economy slides into recession or the fundamentals of the American steel market shift, he said.

“I'm not quite sure it's all set in stone as people believe,” Briem said. “If the market does not bode well for U.S. Steel, for American steel, is Nippon Steel really going to keep these things?”

Former Vice President Mike Pence said he "welcomed" President Donald Trump's actions to combat crime in Washington, D.C., during an interview on CNN, Sunday.

Former Vice President Mike Pence said he supported President Donald Trump's action to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C., when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday.

During an appearance on "State of the Union," Pence was asked what he thought about Trump sending hundreds of National Guard troops to the nation's capital, after Trump faced criticism for how he responded to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

"Here in Washington, D.C., President Trump has deployed the National Guard and other federal troops, ostensibly in response to emergency of lawlessness and high crime in D.C.," Tapper began in his question to Pence.

"I am curious what goes through your mind when you see the president aggressively pushing out the National Guard when he didn‘t do so on January 6th, 2021, as the Capitol was under attack, a mob was trying to lynch you and your family was in danger?" Tapper asked.

CNN'S DANA BASH ROASTED FOR CALLING JAN. 6 ‘MOST VIOLENT MOMENT IN RECENT HISTORY' AFTER TRUMP CRIME PRESSER

Pence called January 6 "a tragic day," before praising Trump's efforts to combat crime in the city. 

He defended the president temporarily taking control of D.C.'s police force as an "important" step to tackle the city's high homicide rate.

"Well, January 6th was a tragic day. But I know we did our duty that day, and I wish the president would have done more. But I welcome his decision to deploy the National Guard and essentially federalize the D.C. police department," Pence said. "I know that it‘s all now working in a very cooperative way."

FORMER CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF SAYS CRIME BY ‘GANGS OF YOUTH' IN DC HAS SPIKED, ESCAPED ‘CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS'

"Jake, if the District of Columbia was actually a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country," he added. "And this is where our national government has to operate, where tens of thousands of people, you included, work every day. I think it's important what the president is doing. I fully support it. And I think the American people welcome the president taking decisive action to ensure the streets of our nation's capital are safe and also continue to provide resources across the country to make all of our cities and towns and communities safe."

Top Democrats across the country have pushed back on Trump's actions, claiming that violent crime is at a 30-year-low, a statistic challenged by some law enforcement experts.

"Violent crime in Washington, D.C., is at a thirty-year low," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on Monday. "Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost."

During a press conference on Monday, President Trump claimed the homicide rate in D.C. is higher than that in notoriously violent cities in nations across the world.

"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher," Trump said Monday. 

"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse," he added.

            In New Mexico's most populous city, National Guard troops are listening to the police dispatch calls, monitoring traffic cameras and helping to secure crime scene perimeters, tasks not usually part of the job.
    


            The New Mexico National Guard is in Albuquerque to help counter what officials have called a surge in crime, but unlike the recent deployment of troops in military fatigues by the federal government in the nation's capital and earlier in Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement, the state's polo-shirted Guard troops were ordered in by the Democratic governor.
    


            And last week, New Mexico's governor declared a state of emergency in other parts of the state, which gives her the discretion to mobilize more troops.
    


            Here's how a National Guard deployment is playing out in New Mexico and why it matters.
    


            Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's state of emergency order issued for Rio Arriba County, the city of Española and area pueblos, was made at the request of the local governments, she said.
    


            The Albuquerque deployment of 60 to 70 troops came after an emergency request from the city's police department citing the “fentanyl epidemic and rising violent juvenile crime as critical issues requiring immediate intervention.”
    


            The new declaration is aimed at helping local police respond to a “significant surge” in violent crime, drug trafficking and public safety threats that have “overwhelmed local resources.” Rio Arriba County has the highest overdose death rate in the state, the governor's news release said.
    


            The troops are helping police with non-law enforcement duties and are not armed, will not make arrests, detain anyone, use force or engage in any immigration-related activities, the city said.
    


            “We understand there are concerns based on what is taking place in other parts of the country, and we want to assure the public that here in Albuquerque, the Guard's role is clearly defined, and focused on support without enforcement,” Police Chief Harold Medina said in a June news release.
    


August 12, 2025: National Guard appears in DC after Trump surges federal authorities



            CNN has contacted the Albuquerque Police Department and the New Mexico National Guard about whether the deployment has been effective but did not receive a response.
    


            “There is no question why the NM National Guard is helping out,” New Mexico National Guard spokesman Hank Minitrez said in a June Facebook post.
    


            The post described troops working behind the scenes in police offices, and conducting traffic management and manning perimeters around crime scenes when necessary.
    


            Albuquerque officials said last month they saw “success with targeted resources” in the city's downtown. Shootings are down 20% this year compared with 2024, the city said in a news release, a figure that tracks with data provided to CNN by the governor's office.
    


            Grisham, a Democrat, criticized President Donald Trump's deployment of 800 troops in Washington, DC, as “executive overreach” and said the contrast “couldn't be clearer” between her state's usage of the National Guard and that of Trump's.
    


            The DC National Guard reports only to the president, while a governor acts as the “commander in chief” of their state's troops and police agencies.
    


            Trump has suggested he could do the same in other major Democratic-led cities despite their leaders not asking for help.
    


            Meanwhile on the West Coast, questions are still lingering in a court case over the president's deployment of troops to Los Angeles in June as dramatic protests unfolded over immigration enforcement in parts of the city.
    


            The visual contrast between the troops in New Mexico and those sent to LA and the capital shows a difference in approach and intent.
    


            Grisham's office said the “key difference” between her deployment of troops and Trump's is her order was in response to direct requests from local communities. “While President Trump uses the National Guard to trample local leadership, New Mexico brings together local and state governments to make our communities genuinely safer,” she said.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the federal intervention in his state “purposely inflammatory.” Washington, DC, Attorney General Brian Schwalb called the president's actions unnecessary and pointed out violent crime in the district reached 30-year lows last year.
    


            Trump said he was going to “look at” taking action in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles because of their crime rates when he announced his plans to take control of DC's police department this week. It is not clear what specifically Trump wants to do in other cities.
    


            New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have all seen a sustained decline in crime so far this year, according to a mid-year report from the independent nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice.
    


            It's a “dangerous precedent” for the federal government to start deploying troops to deal with local and state policing matters, as they are historically used for crowd control, protecting federal property and federal workers, or responding to a natural disaster, according to Jeffrey Swartz, a former National Guard member and professor emeritus at Cooley Law School.
    


            The courts in California have yet to address a claim at the center of the case brought by Newsom to block Trump's deployment of troops in the city: whether the troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law prohibiting the use of the US military for domestic law enforcement.
    


            The three-day trial concluded last week, but the judge did not say when he will rule.
    


Federal judge questions if Trump's deployment of the National Guard in the Los Angeles area is lawful



            “When the president nationalizes a unit or a state National Guard, they now fall under the Posse Comitatus Act saying they are not allowed to be used for civil policing,” said Swartz. “He cannot authorize federal troops to make arrests. That is solely within the power of the governor.”
    


            The National Guard can, however, take someone into custody under circumstances where there's a danger to federal property or federal officers, he added.
    


            The act reserves law enforcement functions to the states, but its language is short, which “lends itself to vagueness and argumentation,” said David Shapiro, lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
    


            Swartz said National Guardsmen “don't like the idea of being on the streets and being put in a position where they might have to use force against fellow citizens.”
    


            “These people are citizen soldiers, not full-time. They have jobs. They have families,” he said. “They signed up to protect the country against external threats, not internal ones.”

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff discusses the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska and the next steps to end the Russia-Ukraine war on ‘Fox News Sunday.'

U.S. Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff claims Russian President Vladimir Putin made "robust" steps toward peace during his meeting with President Donald Trump last week.

Witkoff made the statement during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday" with host Shannon Bream. The official was in the room for the Alaska meeting and has met previously with Putin several times.

"We agreed on much more robust security guarantees," Witkoff said. "The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders."

Witkoff also said Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders directly after the meeting. He said the meeting was "absolutely acknowledged as a win."

Bream pressed Witkoff to explain why Trump did not push Putin for a ceasefire agreement during the meeting as well. Trump had previously said a ceasefire was a top priority and claimed Putin would face consequences if he didn't agree to one.

"The president has always talked about a ceasefire, until he made a lot of different wins in this meeting and began to realize that we could be talking about a peace deal. The ultimate deal here is a peace deal, and we were talking about much more robust security guarantees than anyone ever imagined," he said.

In a statement after the call with Trump, major European leaders did not address whether they preferred a peace deal over a ceasefire.

The leaders said they "welcomed President Trump's efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia's war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace."

Putin described his talks with Trump in Alaska as "very frank."

"We, of course, respect the position of the American administration, which sees the need for a speedy end to military actions," Putin said at the follow-up meeting at the Kremlin, adding that "we would like to move to resolving all issues by peaceful means."

Ann Marie Lawrence, a Maryland mother and women's weight-loss coach, shares her quick-and-easy recipe for a one-pot Philly cheesesteak pasta dish that contains 32 grams of protein.

A frustrated man turned to Reddit after his pregnant sister kept eating his food without asking, leading to an outpouring of support.

In a post on the popular platform, the 30-year-old man shared that his 31-year-old sister had recently left her husband and moved in with him.

"I have a small apartment, but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she's six months pregnant," he wrote. "I wasn't very pleased about this situation, but she is my sis, after all."

At first, things were going fine – until his food started disappearing.

The man wrote that he has very specific foods for his fitness goals and that his sister has been eating these — including his expensive shakes, post-run snacks and meal preps.

A man described how his sister (not pictured) ate his specially chosen protein shakes and snacks without asking him.  (iStock)

"I'm pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly," he wrote. 

"I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something's gone. Makes me crazy."

When confronted about her eating habits, the sister responded by shrugging or blaming hormones.

"I asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. … She refuses to do anything about it," he said.

The brother (not pictured) said he portioned, labeled and planned his groceries each week to support his gym routine. (iStock)

When the man resorted to buying a small mini-fridge and putting it in his bedroom, the sister accused him of "treating her like a thief."

"I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights," he said.

"Now she's sulking and has told our parents, after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her."

"Sibling relationships are often the hardest ones we ever deal with."

The man sharing his story on Reddit also reported that his mother called him and said that "pregnancy isn't easy," especially with his sister's situation.

"I don't think I'm being cruel … I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But at my expense?" he concluded.

Commenters almost unanimously sided with the man.

"Where is she going to stay once the baby is born? You have got bigger problems than groceries, if she won't even contribute to food costs," one person observed.

"Tell your mother to come get your sister, so she can be sure that your sister is being taken care of," another chimed in.

"Boundaries must be put in place with no apologies."

California-based relationship expert Audrey Hope told Fox News Digital the central issue of the disagreement goes far beyond food.

"Sibling relationships are often the hardest ones we ever deal with," she noted. "And there [may be] a primal wound that began long ago in childhood that went unnoticed and unhealed."

Hope also said that the pregnant sister "was probably pampered" as a child, leading to her entitlement as an adult.

Commenters urged the man to set boundaries after his pregnant sister (not pictured) kept helping herself to his groceries. (iStock)

"Boundaries must be put in place with no apologies," she advised.

"The sibling with the apartment needs to know that he is being mistreated, and it is time to own his self-esteem and self-love and put up strong boundaries."

A Spike Lee-directed docuseries featuring Colin Kaepernick that was set to air on ESPN is no longer happening, the network and filmmaker said in a statement on Sunday.

ESPN said the issue was due to "creative differences."

"ESPN, Colin Kaepernick and Spike Lee have collectively decided to no longer proceed with this project as a result of certain creative differences," ESPN told Reuters in a statement. "Despite not reaching finality, we appreciate all the hard work and collaboration that went into this film."

Lee told Reuters on Friday that the documentary was not coming out and that's all he could say. He later added that he signed a nondisclosure about it.

Reuters reported that a Kaepernick rep had no comment.

It was nearly a decade ago when Kaepernick, then of the San Francisco 49ers, protested against racial injustice in the U.S. when he knelt during the national anthem before a preseason game. The demonstrated kickstarted a firestorm around the league, prompting NFL players and President Donald Trump to clash at one point.

Kaepernick protested throughout the 2016 season and left the 49ers before the start of the 2017 season. He has not played in the NFL since then. He filed a collusion lawsuit against the NFL, which was settled in 2019.

Production on the docuseries began in 2022, but the film reportedly faced delays and issues over the direction of the film.

NEW YORK (AP) — Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.

“We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” he told CNN's “State of the Union.” He added that it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called them “game-changing.”

Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.

Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.

Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. “We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the ‘Coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share,” she said.




Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but that much was unclear.

“It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,” he said, “But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees,” he said.

Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which Trump had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

“We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. “We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.”

Rubio, who appeared on three Sunday news shows, said there was not going to be any kind of truce reached because Ukraine was not at the summit.

“Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.”

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, said he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.

“The minute you issue new sanctions, your ability to get them to the table, our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished,” Rubio told NBC's “Meet the Press.”

He also said “we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement” and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work.

“We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off,” Rubio said.

Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.

“I think everybody agreed that we had made progress. Maybe not enough for a peace deal, but we are on the path for the first time,” Witkoff said.

He added: “The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians -- that could not have been discussed at this meeting” with Putin. “We intend to discuss it on Monday. Hopefully we have some clarity on it and hopefully that ends up in a peace deal very, very soon.”

Fox News Digital spoke with APCO International Executive Director and CEO Mel Maier on the need to invest in next-generation 911. 

Healthcare institutions have become a favorite target for bad actors, largely because of how easy they make it for attackers. In June, researchers discovered a healthcare data breach that exposed the personal information of around 8 million patients. All of this information was publicly accessible online without any passwords or authentication protocols.

The latest healthcare organization to fall victim to a breach is DaVita, which has put nearly a million people at risk. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita provides dialysis treatment to about 200,000 patients across the U.S. and 13 other countries.

Kidney dialysis giant DaVita says nearly 916,000 people had personal and medical information exposed in an April ransomware attack (via Comparitech). The breach, which the company disclosed in state filings, compromised names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance details, medical records, tax ID numbers, addresses and even images of checks made out to the company.

DaVita says the incident disrupted internal operations and primarily affected its laboratories. In its latest notice to victims, the company says the cyberattack began March 24, 2025, and continued until April 12. It has not confirmed whether a ransom was paid.

Ransomware gang Interlock claimed responsibility on April 25, posting screenshots of alleged stolen documents and saying it took 1.5TB of DaVita's data. The group lists the company on its public leak site, where it pressures victims by threatening to sell or release stolen files.

DaVita is offering eligible breach victims free identity restoration services through Experian, with a Nov. 28 enrollment deadline. The company has not confirmed how attackers gained access to its network or the size of the ransom demand.

CyberGuy reached out to DaVita for comment but did not receive a response before publication.

Interlock, which first appeared in October 2024, has claimed responsibility for the DaVita attack and at least 23 other ransomware attacks, plus dozens more that remain unverified. Healthcare targets have included Texas Digestive Specialists, Kettering Health and Naper Grove Vision Care, all of which reported data breaches in 2025.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

The DaVita incident is the second-largest U.S. healthcare ransomware attack by number of records this year, behind Frederick Health's January breach. According to Comparitech, there have been 53 confirmed ransomware attacks on American healthcare providers in 2025 alone, compromising more than 3.2 million patient records.

The DaVita data breach exposed sensitive patient information. If you are affected or just want to stay one step ahead, these actions can help minimize your risk.

The DaVita data breach likely gives attackers access to your contact details, which they can misuse. Avoid clicking on unexpected emails or messages, even if they look legitimate.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

Since your personal details were exposed in the DaVita breach, you're more vulnerable to targeted fraud. Consider using a personal data removal service to scrub your personal details from data broker websites that sell your information.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.

DaVita is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't a victim of this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself.

Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.

Adding a second layer of login protection, like a text message or app-based code via 2FA, can make it much harder for DaVita attackers to access your accounts, even if your password is exposed.

Keep an eye out for strange charges or unfamiliar accounts. Set up alerts through your bank and review your credit report regularly to catch fraud early.

The investigation into the DaVita breach is ongoing, and the company has not disclosed how the hackers got in. Nearly a million people now face the possibility of their personal information being used for malicious purposes. Ransomware attacks on hospitals and clinics can lock critical systems, delay care and push providers back to paper records. In severe cases, they can force appointment cancellations and patient diversions and potentially endanger lives.

Three people were killed and another eight were wounded in a mass shooting at a New York City club early Sunday morning.

Gunfire began around 3:30 a.m. inside the Taste of the City Lounge in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Authorities believe a “dispute” took place involving multiple suspects prior to the shooting.

As of Sunday morning, no suspects have been identified or apprehended.

The three deceased victims were all men and were pronounced dead at the crime scene. The eight other victims, five men and three women, were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. The 11 victims ranged in age from 27 to 61.

The shooting comes amid a record low year for gun violence in New York City.

“We have the lowest number of shooting incidents and shooting victims seven months into the year that we've seen on record in the city of New York,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters during a brief press conference.

During the first seven months of this year, New York City experienced 412 shooting incidents with 489 shooting victims. Those numbers are down from the previous record lows in 2017 and 2018, according to the NYPD. Last month also set new record lows, starting with the July 4 holiday weekend, which saw the lowest shooting totals ever recorded for the three-day period.

“Something like this is, of course, thank God, an anomaly, and it's a terrible thing that happened this morning, but we're going to investigate and get to the bottom of what went down,” Tisch said.

At least 36 shell casings were found at the crime scene, police said. Officers recovered a firearm near the scene and are trying to determine whether it was used in the shooting. No other details were immediately provided.

As President Donald Trump declared Washington, D.C., a crime-ridden wasteland in need of federal intervention this week and threatened similar federal interventions in other Black-led cities, several mayors compared notes.

The president's characterization of their cities contradicts what they began noticing last year: that they were seeing a drop in violent crime after a pandemic-era spike. In some cases the declines were monumental, due in large part to more youth engagement, gun buyback programs and community partnerships.

Now members of the African American Mayors Association are determined to stop Trump from burying accomplishments that they already felt were overlooked. And they're using the administration's unprecedented law enforcement takeover in the nation's capital as an opportunity to disprove his narrative about some of the country's greatest urban enclaves.

“It gives us an opportunity to say we need to amplify our voices to confront the rhetoric that crime is just running rampant around major U.S. cities. It's just not true,” said Van Johnson, mayor of Savannah, Georgia, and president of the African American Mayors Association. “It's not supported by any evidence or statistics whatsoever.”

After deploying the first of 800 National Guard members to Washington, the Republican president is setting his sights on other cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland, California, calling them crime-ridden and “horribly run.” One thing they all have in common: They're led by Black mayors.




“It was not lost on any member of our organization that the mayors either were Black or perceived to be Democrats,” Johnson said. “And that's unfortunate. For mayors, we play with whoever's on the field.”

The federal government's actions have heightened some of the mayors' desires to champion the strategies used to help make their cities safer.

Trump argued that federal law enforcement had to step in after a prominent employee of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was attacked in an attempted carjacking. He also pointed to homeless encampments, graffiti and potholes as evidence of Washington “getting worse.” 

However statistics published by Washington's Metropolitan Police contradict the president and show violent crime has dropped there since a post-pandemic peak in 2023.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson scoffed at Trump's remarks, hailing the city's “historic progress driving down homicides by more than 30% and shootings by almost 40% in the last year alone.” 

Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, where homicides fell 14% between 2023 and 2024, called the federal takeover nothing but a performative “power grab.”

In Baltimore, officials say they have seen historic decreases in homicides and nonfatal shootings this year, and those have been on the decline since 2022, according to the city's public safety data dashboard. Carjackings were down 20% in 2023, and other major crimes fell in 2024. Only burglaries have climbed slightly. 

The lower crime rates are attributed to tackling violence with a “public health” approach, city officials say. In 2021, under Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore created a Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan that called for more investment in community violence intervention, more services for crime victims and other initiatives. 

Scott accused Trump of exploiting crime as a “wedge issue and dog whistle” rather than caring about curbing violence. 

“He has actively undermined efforts that are making a difference saving lives in cities across the country in favor of militarized policing of Black communities,” Scott said via email. 

The Democratic mayor pointed out that the Justice Department has slashed over $1 million in funding this year that would have gone toward community anti-violence measures. He vowed to keep on making headway, regardless. 

“We will continue to closely work with our regional federal law enforcement agencies, who have been great partners, and will do everything in our power to continue the progress despite the roadblocks this administration attempts to implement,” Scott said.

Just last week Oakland officials touted significant decreases in crime in the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2024, including a 21% drop in homicides and a 29% decrease in all violent crime, according to the midyear report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Officials credited collaborations with community organizations and crisis response services through the city's Department of Violence Prevention, established in 2017. 

“These results show that we're on the right track,” Mayor Barbara Lee said at a news conference. “We're going to keep building on this progress with the same comprehensive approach that got us here.” 

After Trump gave his assessment of Oakland this week, she rejected it as “fearmongering.” 

Social justice advocates agree that crime has gone down and say Trump is perpetuating exaggerated perceptions that have long plagued Oakland. 

Nicole Lee, executive director of Urban Peace Movement, an Oakland-based organization that focuses on empowering communities of color and young people through initiatives such as leadership training and assistance to victims of gun violence, said much credit for the gains on lower crime rates is due to community groups. 

“We really want to acknowledge all of the hard work that our network of community partners and community organizations have been doing over the past couple of years coming out of the pandemic to really create real community safety,” Lee said. “The things we are doing are working.” 

She worries that an intervention by military forces would undermine that progress. 

“It creates kind of an environment of fear in our community,” Lee said.

In Washington, agents from multiple federal agencies, National Guard members and even the United States Park Police have been seen performing law enforcement duties from patrolling the National Mall to questioning people parked illegally. 

Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said the guard troops will not be armed but declined to elaborate on their assignments to safety patrols and beautification efforts. 

Savannah's Johnson said he is all for partnering with the federal government, but troops on city streets is not what he envisioned. Instead, cities need federal assistance for things like multistate investigation and fighting problems such as gun trafficking, and cybercrimes.

“I'm a former law enforcement officer. There is a different skill set that is used for municipal law enforcement agencies than the military,” Johnson said.

There has also been speculation that federal intervention could entail curfews for young people. 

But that would do more harm, Nicole Lee said, disproportionately affecting young people of color and wrongfully assuming that youths are the main instigators of violence.

“If you're a young person, basically you can be cited, criminalized, simply for being outside after certain hours,” Lee said. “Not only does that not solve anything in regard to violence and crime, it puts young people in the crosshairs of the criminal justice system.”

For now, Johnson said, the mayors are watching their counterpart in Washington, Muriel Bowser, closely to see how she navigates the unprecedented federal intervention. She has been walking a fine line between critiquing and cooperating since Trump's takeover, but things ramped up Friday when officials sued to try to block the takeover.

Johnson praised Bowser for carrying on with dignity and grace. 

“Black mayors are resilient. We are intrinsically children of struggle,” Johnson said. “We learn to adapt quickly, and I believe that we will and we are.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — American lawmakers are using a trip to South Korea and Japan to explore how the United States can tap those allies' shipbuilding expertise and capacity to help boost its own capabilities, which are dwarfed by those of China.

Sens. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Andy Kim, D-N.J., who are scheduled to land in Seoul on Sunday before traveling to Japan, plan to meet top shipbuilders from the world's second- and third-largest shipbuilding countries. The senators want to examine the possibilities of forming joint ventures to construct and repair noncombatant vessels for the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific and bring investments to American shipyards. 

“We already have fewer capacity now than we did during Operation Iraqi Freedom” in 2003, Duckworth told The Associated Press. “We have to rebuild the capacity. At the same time, what capacity we have is aging and breaking down and taking longer and more expensive to fix.”

Their trip comes as President Donald Trump demands a plan to revive U.S. shipyards and engage foreign partners. The Pentagon is seeking $47 billion for shipbuilding in its annual budget. The urgency stems from the fact that Washington severely lags behind China in building naval ships, a situation raising alarms among policymakers who worry the maritime balance of power could shift to China, now the world's No. 1 shipbuilder.

Duckworth, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she hopes the trip could lead to joint ventures among the U.S. military, American companies and foreign partners to build auxiliary vessels for the Navy and small boats for the Army.

Another possibility is repairing U.S. ships in the Indo-Pacific region. 




“If we have to bring ships all the way back to the United States ... to wait two years to be fixed, that doesn't help the situation,” Duckworth said.

The discussions, she said, will focus on auxiliary vessels, which are noncombatant ships such as fueling and cargo vessels that support naval and military operations. The Navy's auxiliary fleet is aging and insufficient in numbers, she said.

The U.S. commercial shipbuilding accounted for 0.1% of global capacity in 2024, while China produced 53%, followed by South Korea and Japan, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. A Navy review from April 2024 found that many of its major shipbuilding programs were one year to three years behind schedule. 

During the trip, the senators are expected to meet representatives from major shipbuilders in the region. 

South Korea and the U.S. are already making progress on shipbuilding cooperation. In March, Hanwha Ocean completed maintenance work for a 41,000-ton U.S. Navy dry cargo and ammunition ship in South Korea. The overhaul of USNS Wally Schirra was the Korean company's first project after it secured a repair agreement with the U.S. Navy in July 2024.

Hanwha Group last year acquired Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, which builds large merchant mariners, part of the reserve auxiliary fleet.

Earlier this month, South Korea proposed to invest $150 billion in the U.S. shipbuilding industry to support Trump's “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” initiative as part of its tariffs talk with the White House.

Duckworth said she had earlier conversations with Hyundai Heavy Industries “about them actually buying into U.S. shipyards on U.S. soil”.

This month, China formed the world's biggest shipbuilding company by merging two state-owned shipbuilders. The combined entity China State Shipbuilding Corporation produces Chinese navy's combat vessels from aircraft carriers to nuclear submarines. It commands 21.5% of global shipbuilding market.

The alternative to affirmative action is now under attack.

President Donald Trump's administration is scrutinizing higher education. Last week, the White House issued a memorandum requiring all universities receiving federal funds to submit admissions data on all applicants to the Department of Education. The goal is to enforce the 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action.

Days before the memo was released, Columbia and Brown agreed to share their admissions data with the administration, broken down by race, grade point average, and standardized test scores. The administration suspects that universities are using “racial proxies” to get around the ban on race-based admissions. The Department of Education is expected to build a database of the admissions data and make it available to parents and students.

Amid this increased federal scrutiny, an alternative idea from Richard Kahlenberg, director of the American Identity Project for the Progressive Policy Institute, is gaining attention. Kahlenberg, who testified in the Supreme Court cases against Harvard and UNC, advocates for class-based affirmative action instead of race-based admissions. He argues that this approach will yield more economically and racially equitable results.

Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Kahlenberg about how he contends with the consequences of helping gut race-based affirmative action, why he believes class-based affirmative action is the path forward, and if his own argument may come in the crosshairs of a Trump administration eager to stamp out all forms of affirmative action.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You're the director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute. I would take it to mean that you are a progressive.

It's complicated these days. I'm left of center. I think of myself more as liberal than progressive.

I ask because you testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the case Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College. This is the case that essentially gutted race-based affirmative action. It doesn't sound like a progressive, or even a left-of-center, position. What was going on? Explain what you were thinking.

I've long been a supporter of racial diversity in colleges. I think that's enormously important, but I've been troubled that elite colleges were racially integrated, but economically segregated.

I think there's a better way of creating racial diversity — a more liberal way, if you will — which is to give low-income and economically disadvantaged students of all races a leg up in the admissions process in order to create both racial and economic diversity.

What was the data that you looked at that led you to believe that? Were primarily wealthy Black and Hispanic students benefiting from affirmative action?

There'd been a number of studies over the years that had come to that conclusion, including from supporters of race-based affirmative action. Then, in the litigation, further evidence came out. At Harvard, 71 percent of the Black and Hispanic students came from the most socioeconomically privileged 20 percent of the Black and Hispanic population nationally.

Now, to be clear, the white and Asian students were even richer. But for the most part, this was not a program that was benefiting working-class and low-income students.

Alright, so the Supreme Court in 2023 hands down this decision that says, essentially, we're done with race-based affirmative action. Was there a difference in how progressives and conservatives interpreted the Supreme Court ruling?

Most mainstream conservatives have always said they were opposed to racial preferences, but of course, they were for economic affirmative action. But now we have some on the extreme, including the Trump administration, saying that economic affirmative action is also illegal if part of the rationale for the policy is seeking to increase racial diversity.

What do you make of that? That was your team once upon a time, right?

Well, I think it's troubling when people shift the goalposts. In a number of the Supreme Court concurring opinions in the case, conservatives said that economic affirmative action made a lot of sense. Justice [Neil] Gorsuch, for example, said if Harvard got rid of legacy preferences and instead gave economic affirmative action, that would be perfectly legal. And now some extremists are shifting their position and saying they're opposed to any kind of affirmative action.

Are you surprised by that shift?

I'm not surprised. I'm confident, however, that a majority of the US Supreme Court won't go that far. The Supreme Court, to some degree, looks to public opinion. Racial preferences were always unpopular. But economic affirmative action is broadly supported by the public.

The Supreme Court has had two cases come before it, subsequent to the  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision. One involved a challenge to class-based affirmative action at Thomas Jefferson High School in Northern Virginia, and the other involved an attack on a similar class-based affirmative action program at the Boston exam schools, like Boston Latin. In both cases, the Supreme Court said we're not gonna hear those cases over the vehement dissent of a couple of extremely conservative justices. So I'm fairly confident that the Supreme Court will not go down the path of striking down economic-based preferences.

What do you make of this move by the Trump administration to ask colleges for data? 

I'm of two minds about it. I do think transparency is good in higher education. These institutions are receiving lots of taxpayer money. We want to make sure they're following the Supreme Court ruling, which said you can't use race.

Having said that, I'm quite nervous about how the Trump administration will use the data, because if a college discloses the average SAT scores and grades by race of applicants, of those admitted, and then those enrolled, one of two things can be going on. One is that the university's cheating and they're using racial preferences, and that would be a violation of the law.

The other possibility is that they did shift to economic affirmative action, which is perfectly legal.

And because Black and Hispanic students are disproportionately low income and working class, they will disproportionately benefit from a class-based affirmative action program. And so the average SAT score is going to look somewhat lower. I'm worried that the Trump administration will go after both race-based and class-based affirmative action.

Because class-based affirmative action still might mean a college is admitting more Black and Hispanic students. And what the Trump administration seems to have the issue with is that fact.

Yes. Increasingly, that's what it looks like. As long as the Trump administration was focused on counting race and deciding who gets ahead, they had the American public on their side. But Americans also support the idea of racially integrated student bodies, they just don't like racial preferences as the means for getting there. So, if Trump says, no matter how you achieve this racial diversity, I'm just opposed to racial diversity, he'll have lost the public. And I don't think he will be consistent with the legal framework under Students for Fair Admissions, either.

Do you think he cares?

Well, I think he ought to care if he cares about the future of his political party. Because under class-based affirmative action, it is true that Black and Hispanic students will disproportionately benefit, but it will also benefit white working-class students. And those are the students who are coming from families that form the base of the Republican Party. So I think it would be a big mistake if the Trump administration were to really push hard on that angle.

            Kei'Yanii Dawson dreams of attending a historically Black college where she can take classes and engage in campus life with more students who look like her.
    


            But Dawson, a junior at a majority-White private high school in San Francisco, said that would likely mean going to school far from home and taking on more debt for housing and out-of-state tuition.
    


            However, a growing movement to expand the presence of HBCUs into more communities outside the South could soon give students like Dawson easier access to a Black college.
    


            Officials in cities such as Boston and San Francisco say they are actively working to bring satellite campuses of HBCUs to their communities, hoping to strengthen the pipeline for Black students to pursue higher education and to grow and diversify their local economies.
    


            “I feel like if there was a satellite (HBCU) here in San Francisco, it would just be so much easier,” Dawson said. “An education coming to me instead of me going so far, there's definitely more benefits from that, money-wise.”
    


            Advocates for HBCUs insist these proposals are critical as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion programs at predominantly White institutions, such as Harvard University, and as Black students seek schools where they feel included and celebrated.
    


            President Donald Trump has decried DEI initiatives as “illegal and immoral discrimination.”



            Earlier this year, the Trump administration proposed a 2026 fiscal year budget that would cut $64 million in funding for Howard University, the nation's only federally chartered HBCU. The National Institutes of Health also canceled a $16.3 million grant for Florida A&M University's pharmacy school as part of Trump's effort to end DEI programs.
    


            US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher on Thursday struck down two administration actions that threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions with DEI programs, ruling the Education Department violated the law, according to The Associated Press.
    


            Despite his administration's attacks on DEI, Trump signed an executive order in April supporting HBCUs.
    


            “This order will continue the work begun during my first Administration to elevate the value and impact of our Nation's HBCUs as beacons of educational excellence and economic opportunity that serve as some of the best cultivators of tomorrow's leaders in business, government, academia, and the military,” it read.
    


            HBCUs were first established in the mid to late 1800s, when legal segregation in the South prevented Black students from enrolling in existing colleges and schools in the North imposed quotas on the number of Black students who could attend. During this period, HBCUs became the primary means of providing a college education to Black people. Today, the majority of HBCUs are located in the South.
    


            Keith Lezama, CEO and founder of Building Bridges Education — a nonprofit dedicated to providing New England students with access and pathways to HBCUs — said he supports the expansion of Black colleges. He said many Black families in communities without HBCUs are not aware of their impact.
    


            HBCUs “are a movement that has allowed access when access wasn't allowed,” Lezama said. “A movement that instills a sense of pride, resilience that produces amazing leaders in our communities and across the world. To know many of these institutions do this without the same resources (as predominantly White colleges), is something that can be seen as a national model of what excellence looks like in education.”
    


            In June, Boston City Councilor Brian Worrell filed a hearing order proposing the establishment of an HBCU satellite campus in Boston.  He said during a June 25 city council meeting that Boston is known for being a college town, “but we do not have a single HBCU.”
    


            The closest HBCUs to Boston are Cheyney University of Pennsylvania and Lincoln University, both more than 300 miles away.
    


            HBCUs, Worrell said, are known for producing a higher percentage of low-income, first-generation Black college graduates than majority-White institutions.
    


            “If we are serious about building a diverse workforce here in Boston in tech, health care, education, government, then we need to be just as serious about the pipelines that people get here,” Worrell said.
    


            Establishing a satellite campus is a lengthy process that could take years to complete, advocates say.
    


            Worrell said it is not yet clear if or when the HBCU would open in Boston, and officials have not yet decided which school the city will partner with.
    


            Boston is hosting a listening session on August 26 to allow community members to share their thoughts on what they want to see in a satellite campus, he said. Worrell will consider their feedback in his proposal for the school.
    


            He also hopes to work with HBCUs on an initiative that would allow students at local institutions to transfer credits to the satellite school when it opens.
    


            Officials from Huston-Tillotson University, a small private HBCU in Austin, Texas, say they are also working to establish an off-campus instructional site in San Diego.
    


            California has the largest out-of-state student enrollment at Huston-Tillotson, said Archibald Vanderpuye, the university's provost and vice president of academic affairs. The school is located about 1,300 miles from San Diego.
    


            “Our partners are looking at ways to increase access to and completion of college degrees among underrepresented minority students by providing them with meaningful HBCU experiences,” Beverly Downing, associate provost at Huston-Tillotson University, said in a statement.
    


            Downing said there is growing interest among students and families in expanding the school to California.
    


            “We started getting a lot of calls and getting requests for a presence there so that the students would have a choice of whether to come out to Texas or to take courses (in California),” Downing said.
    


            The university plans to launch the off-campus instructional site in San Diego with a business administration program in spring 2026, Downing said.
    


            Plans for the San Diego location are underway and the school is required to obtain numerous approvals, including for the off-campus instructional site plan and accreditation, Downing said.
    


            In San Francisco, officials are also in active discussions about bringing an HBCU satellite campus to the city, Charles Lutvak, spokesperson for Mayor Daniel Lurie, said.
    


            Lutvak said he was unable to provide details on a timeline or which Black colleges are in discussions with city leaders.
    


            The conversations follow the city's launch of the Black 2 San Francisco initiative last year, which seeks to “create a satellite campus partnership with several HBCUs, including a physical location in San Francisco, and a full suite of academic and professional programming.”
    


            Former Mayor London Breed said last year that an HBCU campus in San Francisco would “boost our downtown and our economy, while bringing new minds and ideas to grow within our world-renowned culture of innovation.”
    


            Harry Williams, president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, said developing satellite locations for HBCUs across the country will help increase the number of Black Americans in the middle class.
    


            HBCUs produce 70% of Black doctors and dentists, 50% of Black engineers and 35% of Black attorneys, according to the United Negro College Fund.
    


            Williams said HBCUs have higher retention and graduation rates among Black students.
    


            Black students can also experience a sense of belonging and culture at HBCUs that they may not find at predominantly White institutions, where DEI and affirmative action are under attack, Williams said.
    


            “Being in a place where you are wanted, that's the key,” he said. “These institutions were created for African Americans.”
    


            Some people, however, oppose expanding HBCUs to other communities.
    


            “You want to attend an HBCU, then move to a city where the school history and culture already exist,” one user posted on X. “Our resources are stretched enough. Plus, our cities depend on the migration of students from the North.”
    


            “One of the lures of HBCUs is the historical part and putting a satellite campus somewhere random disconnects that,” another user posted on X. “Especially in Boston.”
    


            Brandon Graham, founder and CEO of Our HBCUs Matter Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to educational programming for high school and HBCU students, said he believes it will be challenging for satellite campuses to replicate the connections and experiences students receive on an HBCU's main campus. However, he said there are creative ways to achieve this.
    


            HBCUs must “ensure that you cultivate programmatic models and bring in alumni for those folks who are local to then be able to share and cultivate that synergy that you initially get on an HBCU campus,” said Graham, a graduate of both Clark Atlanta University and Tennessee State University.
    


            Graham said he is confident that HBCUs have the connections and resources to expand their reach to communities across the country, just as predominantly White institutions have done.
    


            “It will have positive effects on the institutional educational branding, on its financials, as well as on its ability to cultivate a very diverse alumni base across the country,” Graham said. “This next level of satellite campuses is going to diversify and transform the way an HBCU education can be provided.”

            Greg Iles, the Mississippi author of the “Natchez Burning” trilogy and other works, has died. He was 65.
    


            Iles died Friday after a decades-long battle with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, his literary agent Dan Conaway posted Saturday on Facebook.
    


            Initially diagnosed with the incurable condition in 1996, he kept his illness private until completing his final novel, “Southern Man,” which was published in 2024.
    


            Iles was born in Germany but moved to Natchez, Mississippi, with his family when he was just three years old and developed a deep connection with the region. Many of his stories are set in Mississippi, including the “Natchez Burning” trilogy, historical fiction suspense novels exploring race and class in the 1960s Jim Crow South.
    


            Conaway described Iles as “warm, funny, fearless, and completely sui generis.”
    


            “To be on the other end of the phone as he talked through character and plot, problem-solving on the fly, was to be witness to genius at work, plain and simple,” he wrote on Saturday. “As a writer he fused story-craft, bone-deep humanity, and a growing sense of moral and political responsibility with the ferocious precisions of a whirling dervish or a master watchmaker.”
    


            In March 2011, Iles suffered a ruptured aorta and a partial leg amputation and spent eight days in a medically induced coma after another driver struck his car on Highway 61 near Natchez. He eventually recovered.
    


            Iles performed with the musical group The Rock Bottom Remainders along with popular authors Stephen King, Amy Tan and others.

Hurricane Erin exploded in strength to a Category 5 storm in the Caribbean on Saturday, rapidly powering up from a tropical storm in a single day, the National Hurricane Center said.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Hurricane Erin exploded in strength and became a major storm in Atlantic waters just north of the Caribbean on Saturday, rapidly powering up from a tropical storm in a single day and bringing heavy rains and high winds to islands in the region. 

The first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, Erin reached Category 5 status before weakening somewhat and becoming a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 

Late Saturday night, the center reported that Erin was “undergoing structural changes” but was still “formidable” as its rain and winds buffeted Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The storm's center was about 145 miles (230 kilometers) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and it was heading toward the west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). It was not forecast to make a direct hit on land. 

Hurricane center director Mike Brennen said Erin grew into a “very powerful hurricane,” with its winds gaining 60 mph (96 kph) in about nine hours.

Forecasters predicted it will remain a major hurricane into the coming week.




The storm's center was forecast pass north of Puerto Rico, according to the National Hurricane Center. Nevertheless, it said, heavy rain in some areas could trigger flash flooding, landslides and mudslides.

Tropical storm watches were issued for St. Martin, St. Barts and the Turks and Caicos Islands. 

The National Weather Service in San Juan issued an alert for Saturday night for nearly two thirds of Puerto Rico, warning of 50 mph (80 kph) winds and urging people to shelter in safe structures. Power was knocked out to about 130,000 customers in the territory. 

Locals and tourists walked and shopped as usual earlier in the day in Puerto Rico's capital. Restaurants were busy, and despite warnings to avoid beaches, people could be seen in the water. 

Sarahí Torres and Joanna Cornejo, who were visiting from California for a Bad Bunny concert, said they decided to go to the beach and wade in because the skies were calm.

“The weather looked fine, so we came out,” Torres said.

The U.S. government deployed more than 200 employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies as a precaution. Puerto Rico Housing Secretary Ciary Pérez Peña said 367 shelters were inspected and ready to open if needed.

Officials in the Bahamas also prepared shelters and urged people to monitor the storm's progress.

Powerful rip currents could affect the U.S. East Coast from Florida to the mid-Atlantic next week, despite the eye of the storm forecast to remain far offshore, Brennan said.

Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin gained strength at a pace that was “incredible for any time of year, let alone Aug. 16.” 

Lowry said only four other Category 5 hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic on or before Aug. 16. 

The most powerful storms tend to form later in the year, with the hurricane season typically peaking in mid-September.

In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma rocketed from a tropical storm to a Category 5 in less than 24 hours, according to National Hurricane Center advisories from that time. Wilma weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida. And in October 2007, Hurricane Felix took just over a day to go from a tropical storm to Category 5.

Including Erin, there have been 43 hurricanes that have reached Category 5 status on record in the Atlantic, said Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private forecasting company.

“They're certainly rare, although this would mark the fourth year in a row that we've had one in the Atlantic basin,” Pydynowski said.

Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly. 

Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Hurricane Erick, a Pacific storm that made landfall June 19 in Oaxaca, Mexico, also strengthened rapidly, doubling in intensity in less than a day.

Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 and is expected to be unusually busy. Six to 10 hurricanes are predicted for the season, including three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph).

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.

West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention.

The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. 

By adding outside troops to the existing D.C. Guard deployment and federal law enforcement presence, Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.

National Guard members have played a limited role in the federal intervention so far, and it's unclear why additional troops are needed. They have been patrolling at landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station and assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control.




The Republican governors of the three states said they were sending hundreds of troops at the request of the Trump administration.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he directed 300 to 400 Guard troops to head to Washington, adding that the state “is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital.” 

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen to help law enforcement in Washington at the Pentagon's request. He noted that if a hurricane or other natural disaster strikes, they would be recalled.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police from the Guard to “carry out presence patrols and serve as added security” and that they were expected to arrive in the coming days. His statement said Army Secretary Dan Driscoll requested the troops.

The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.

A protest against Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, “No fascist takeover of D.C.,” and some in the crowd held signs saying, “No military occupation.” 

Morgan Taylor, one of the protest organizers, said they were hoping to spark enough backlash to Trump's actions that the administration would be forced to pull back on its crime and immigration agenda.

“It's hot, but I'm glad to be here. It's good to see all these people out here,” she said. “I can't believe that this is happening in this country at this time.”

Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreaching and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington.

John Finnigan, 55, was taking a bike ride when he ran into the protest in downtown Washington. The real estate construction manager who has lived in the capital for 27 years said Trump's moves were “ridiculous” because crime is down.

“Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities,” Finnigan said.

Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for the safety or her students given the “unmarked officers of all types” now roaming Washington and detaining people.

Dickstein said she turned out to the protest with friends and relatives to “prevent a continuous domino effect going forward with other cities.”

Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.

City leaders, who are obliged to cooperate with Trump's order under the federal laws that direct the district's local governance, have sought to work with the administration, though they have bristled at the scope of the president's takeover.

On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an “emergency police commissioner” after the district's top lawyer sued. 

After a court hearing, Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, issued a memo directing the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law. 

City officials say they are evaluating how to best comply.

In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government's failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.”

In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.” 

She added that if Washington residents stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy — even when we don't have full access to it.”

Fifth-generation cattle rancher Steve Lucie discusses how tariffs affect the cattle industry on 'America Reports.'

The United States plans to breed thousands of sterile flies in a southern Texas factory in an effort to protect American cattle from flesh-eating maggots in Mexico.

The New World screwworm is a "devastating pest," the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a news release this week. 

"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal. NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people. It is not only a threat to our ranching community, but it is a threat to our food supply and our national security."

Factory construction is expected to cost $750 million, and it would be located at Moore Air Force Base outside Edinburg, Texas, about 20 miles north of the border.

The USDA says sterile flies are "currently the most effective way to prevent the spread of" the maggots, adding it hopes to produce and release them into the wild within a year.

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the government also plans to spend $100 million on technology such as traps and lures, therapeutics, border patrols by "tick riders" mounted on horseback, dogs trained to sniff out the parasite and other tools that could "bolster preparedness or response to NWS."

Rollins added that the border will remain closed to cattle, horse and bison imports from Mexico until the parasite appears to be pushed back closer to Panama, where it had been contained until late last year through the breeding of sterile flies there. 

"Farm security is national security," Rollins said at a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week. "All Americans should be concerned. But it's certainly Texas and our border and livestock-producing states that are on the front lines of this every day."

The parasite has hit Mexican cattle industry hard, and Mexico's agriculture ministry said it plans to take steps to mitigate the problem.

The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Saturday it was adopting a no-tolerance policy for homeless encampments in support of the Trump administration's "beautification" efforts in Washington, D.C.

The previous encampment policy suggested homelessness should be "rare, brief and non-recurring," according to the District of Columbia website.

It noted the protocol for cleaning public spaces was only triggered when a site presented a security, health or safety risk or if it interfered with community use. 

"With this in mind, we provide resources to shelter, pathways to housing and access to behavioral health services to individuals at these locations," officials wrote on the website.

TOP TRUMP OFFICIAL VOWS TO END 'CYCLE OF GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCY' IN HOMELESS CRACKDOWN

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday those living in homeless encampments will need to either accept treatment at a homeless shelter or go to jail if they refuse.

The U.S. Park Police have already removed 70 homeless encampments in D.C., with only a few remaining, Leavitt said. 

The remaining two sites were expected to be cleared this week by multi-agency teams, including the FBI, Secret Service and D.C. police.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also announced other interior policy modifications for criminal activity.

Burgum noted that anyone who damages federal property will be "prosecut[ed] to the fullest extent," though it is unclear what the former policy was.

He added that U.S. Park Police public information officers (PIO) will be more hands-on, with the ability to pursue fleeing criminals under specified circumstances.

Burgum did not specify what led to the PIO policy change.

In this article

A softer-than-expected July inflation report has improved investor sentiment and revived hopes for a rate cut. Traders await more economic data to gain further insights about the state of the U.S. economy.

Looking beyond macro uncertainties and tariff pressures, it is always a good idea for investors to search for stocks that have strong long-term growth potential and enhance their portfolio returns. To this end, recommendations from top Wall Street analysts can help pick attractive stocks, as these experts perform an in-depth analysis of a company's financials and growth prospects.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is social media platform Pinterest (PINS). The company recently reported mixed results for the second quarter of 2025. While second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, earnings missed the Street's consensus estimate. Meanwhile, Pinterest's third-quarter revenue outlook topped analysts' estimates.

In reaction to the Q2 print, BMO Capital analyst Brian Pitz increased the price forecast for Pinterest stock to $41 from $40 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on PINS stock with a price target of $40.

Pitz noted that Pinterest delivered upbeat revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) in the quarter, fueled by the company's solid execution and the strength in the retail and financial services businesses. However, the analyst pointed out that Q2 performance was adversely impacted by a 25% drop in advertising pricing resulting from the company's rising market share in previously unmonetized markets around the globe.

Pitz views Pinterest as a "Clear AI Winner." While users are gaining from AI-powered search functions and algorithm upgrades on PINS' platform, advertisers are using Performance+ Creative Preview to observe modifications made by PINS+ creative tools and maximize ad efficiency.

"As AI continues to drive enhancements, we see it as a clear tailwind for PINS to both improve user experience and drive greater efficiency," said Pitz.

The analyst added that advertisers are also benefiting from Pinterest's useful customer insights, given that Gen-Z now constitutes more than half the platform's user base.

Pitz ranks No. 95 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 72% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.

We next move to the AI cloud computing company CoreWeave (CRWV), which reported market-beating revenue for the second quarter and issued better-than-anticipated top-line guidance for the third quarter. However, the AI infrastructure company reported a larger-than-expected loss for the second quarter.

Following the Q2 results, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on CoreWeave stock with a price target of $180. The 5-star analyst highlighted the 86% year-over-year jump in CRWV's remaining performance obligations (RPO). However, Thill noted the disappointment related to the limited sequential upside in RPO compared to the high buyside expectations following the $4 billion expanded deal with OpenAI signed in May.

Nonetheless, Thill remains optimistic, given that CoreWeave signed expansion deals with two hyperscalers, which he believes reflects "the unrelenting demand for high performance compute and CRWV's best in class capabilities."

Thill's bullish view on the company's backlog is also supported by the ramp-up in its capacity. Notably, CoreWeave added 600 megawatts of contracted power, bringing the total capacity to 2.2 gigawatts. Overall, the analyst is confident about RPO acceleration going forward, given that AI demand continues to exceed supply.

Thill ranks No. 317 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.3%. See CoreWeave Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at the well-known coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX). Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded Starbucks stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $115 from $100.

Tarantino has "high conviction that turnaround strategies under new leadership will be effective in transforming Starbucks into a better company."

Given the recent underperformance of SBUX stock – which has sunk by 16% over the past six months – Tarantino believes that it now has an improved risk/reward profile. He expects the turnaround initiatives under chairman and CEO Brian Niccol to drive improvement in U.S. comparable sales in Fiscal 2026. The company's turnaround initiatives are focused on ensuring high levels of hospitality and a faster speed of service in stores.

Moreover, Tarantino expects to gain more visibility on SBUX's earnings outlook over the upcoming quarters, as the impact of the turnaround efforts starts to become clear. In particular, the analyst expects more details on Starbucks' cost-saving initiatives and greater clarity on store-level labor investments to provide insights into the company's long-term aim to revive its operating margin to the level of 17% seen in Fiscal 2019, compared to 10.3% in Fiscal 2025.

Overall, Tarantino expects SBUX's multiple to expand on signs of improvement in financial performance, driven by the company's turnaround efforts.

Tarantino ranks No. 441 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.8%. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is not quite as keen as Tarantino, assigning a "neutral" rating on SBUX stock with a price target of $99.  See Starbucks Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the United States and European nations to give Ukraine "Article 5-like protection" as a security guarantee to bring an end to the war.

"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article Five-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," Witkoff said Sunday on CNN.

It was "the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that," he continued.

NATO's Article 5 says that "if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked."

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday that she welcomed the security guarantees for Ukraine, and that the "European Union ... is ready to do its share," according to the Associated Press.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it is "a historic decision that the United States is ready to take part in security guarantees for Ukraine," according to a post on X.

"Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe's participation," he wrote.

Special envoy Witkoff's remarks come just days after President Donald Trump met in Alaska with Putin amid his country's ongoing war with Ukraine. Trump and his administration hailed the talks as "productive," but details of the meeting have so far been scant.

Trump, in the lead-up to his meeting with Putin, repeatedly stressed the need for an urgent, long-lasting ceasefire in the war.

The talks did not yield such an agreement, sparking concern among officials in Ukraine and European nations that Trump was moving away from the goal.

In the days since the talks, Trump, however, has said that the "best way" to end the war is "to go directly to a Peace Agreement."

Witkoff said Sunday that Trump and Putin "covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal" during their hours-long meeting, without providing additional details.

"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal," he said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Sunday that Russia will face "additional consequences" if Trump's effort to end the war "doesn't work out," but warned against implementing additional sanctions.

"The minute you levy additional sanctions, strong additional sanctions, the talking stops," he said on ABC News.

Rubio added that "we're still a long ways off" from a peace agreement.

"We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remain some big areas of disagreement," he said. "We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement, we're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made towards one."

Trump is set to meet with Zelenskyy and European leaders on Monday.

If the Kremlin did in fact agree to security conditions for Ukraine similar to NATO's Article 5, it would be a stark departure from at least one of the Russian president's previous justifications for attacking the country.

Russia has said any resolution to the war would need to address the "root causes of the conflict," most significantly Ukraine demilitarizing and abandoning its aspirations of joining NATO.

The Kremlin has also made clear it wants any peace deal to include international recognition of its annexation of Crimea and significant portions of eastern Ukraine.

Following Friday's summit, Trump said a peace deal could be reached if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the Donbas region, the New York Times reported, citing senior European officials.

But Zelenskyy has been adamant that Kyiv will never recognize any of its sovereign territory as part of Russia, even regions Moscow has already annexed. The Ukrainian president has said doing so would violate the country's Constitution. Ukraine has also said it wants any peace deal to include guarantees that Russia will never invade again.

"Everyone agrees that borders must not be changed by force," Zelenskyy wrote on X.

"Everyone supports that key issues must be resolved with Ukraine's participation in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the U.S., and the Russian chief."

Rubio also said Sunday on NBC News that "there has to be talk about what the territories are going to look like and what the border lines are going to look like at the end of this conflict."

"There has to be talk about how Ukraine is rebuilt, and how do you rebuild a country that's been attacked as often as it has over the last three and a half years," he added.

One of the most common myths about long-term relationships is that couples eventually run out of things to say. It's easy to believe: Life gets busy, routines take over and conversations become more about logistics than connection.

As a psychologist who studies couples, and based on my own experience being happily married, I know how tricky communication can become if you're convinced there's nothing left to say. But couples in healthy relationships make a habit of talking about things that matter, every single day.

Their conversations stay fresh, connected and meaningful because they never stop learning about each other. Here are five things people in the happiest relationships talk to each other about every day — that most people neglect.

Couples in thriving relationships always make a point to check in and make sure the other partner is happy.

On some days, that means asking: "Do you feel loved? Supported? Connected?" Other days, it's about expressing appreciation, sharing a laugh over a favorite memory or talking about something they're looking forward to doing together.

Having these daily check-ins help prevent small misunderstandings from growing into larger issues.

In the strongest relationships, both partners stay curious about what excites the other. It could be a song they can't stop listening to, a book they've been devouring, a hobby they're exploring or even a TikTok that made them laugh.

Regardless of whether their interests overlap, they stay curious about each other's passions. This is what keeps the spark alive.

Over their years together, these little updates remind one another of perhaps the most important thing to remember in a relationship: "We're constantly growing and evolving, and we're doing it together."

Happy couples are never stuck in the present or past. They often have conversations about long-term goals: owning a home, traveling more, starting a business or raising kids.

They also don't shy away from less practical, more whimsical topics, like what they'd do with a year off, how they'd renovate their dream kitchen or where they'd go if money wasn't a concern.

Discussing dreams, no matter how realistic or farfetched, keeps the relationship future-oriented by instilling a joint sense of purpose and possibility. Even if a dream can't be acted on right away, talking it over allows them to keep track of each other's values.

Happy couples aren't uncomfortable bringing up what's bothering them. A healthy relationship should feel like a safe space where couples can work through their troubles together as a team.

Whether it's a tough day at work, a lingering insecurity or even a fear about the relationship itself, they trust their partner to respond with empathy.

Over time, this daily practice of being emotionally honest builds a rock-solid sense of safety. Both partners will never feel like they have to carry their baggage alone.

Even a half-formed musing can be a fun way to connect. Happy couples never think twice about sharing their random ideas: their shower thoughts, their "what-ifs," their "this just popped into my head" theories.

And these don't always have to be deep or profound. In fact, they're usually pretty silly, weird or seemingly irrelevant. Adding a little bit of playfulness and spontaneity into every conversation also makes space for laughter and even intimacy.

I always remind couples that a big part of building a successful relationship is about being intentional with the conversations you choose to have. Couples who stay connected day after day create a shared space for curiosity, growth and joy.

With more families concerned about how they will afford college, some schools are offering an unbeatable deal.

While the total cost of college is nearing or crossing the $100,000 threshold at several institutions across the country, according to data provided by The Princeton Review, tuition is completely free for all students at handful of other colleges and universities in the U.S.

Although paying this tab is easy, getting in may not be. Each of these schools has high academic standards, experts say — and in return for a degree at no cost, the commitment they require, even after graduation, is steep.

"This is a self-selecting group in a lot of ways," said Robert Franek, editor in chief at The Princeton Review. Yet "it gives some hope for parents who worry about making college affordable — these colleges are doing just that."

For those up for the challenge, The Princeton Review compiled a list of the colleges that cost nothing. Here are the nine schools that don't charge tuition at all.

For over 150 years, this small school in Berea, Kentucky has strived to reach first-generation and low-income students who otherwise could not afford to pay for college, according to the school. But it doesn't stop there: Berea gives every student a laptop and funds to cover internship opportunities and even professional clothing for job interviews.

Dubbed "Hard Work U," College of the Ozarks is a coed Christian school in rural Missouri geared toward serving students in the Ozark region. In return for a full scholarship, undergraduates must work 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks during the academic year as part of the school's work program.

Only 12 to 15 students are admitted each year to this all-male liberal arts college in California's remote High Desert, according to the school. However, every student is awarded a scholarship that covers tuition and room and board. Since Deep Springs is a two-year school with no majors, many graduates go on to transfer to four-year programs to complete a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree.

In addition to free tuition and room and board, students receive a stipend to cover all other costs at this academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado. In exchange, the academic and physical demands are rigorous, according to The Princeton Review, with classes from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. followed by fitness training multiple times a week. After four years, graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants in the Air Force or U.S. Space Force and commit to several years of active duty.

This New London, Connecticut-based academy is also highly selective and demanding, according to The Princeton Review. The extremely structured four-year program, which is fully paid for by the government, offers 10 academic majors, including civil engineering and marine science. After completing their schooling, students commit to five years of service, although many opt to stay in the Coast Guard for much longer, the academy says.

Tuition, room and board, uniforms and books are similarly covered at this service academy in Kings Point, New York. As part of the four-year program, cadets gain hands-on experience working aboard commercial and military vessels around the world. Once they graduate, midshipmen can enter any branch of the armed forces as an officer. The service obligation varies depending on what type of job they choose.

Every cadet at this prestigious institution in West Point, New York receives free tuition and a scholarship that covers room and board, in addition to a stipend for uniforms, books, supplies and all other expenses. Armed with a BS degree, West Point graduates then serve at least five years of active duty and three years in the reserves and are "ready for a lifetime of service to the Army and nation," according to the academy.

All students on campus, known as "the Yard," in Annapolis, Maryland, receive a full scholarship that covers tuition, room and board and other costs, in return for at least five years of active duty after graduation, followed by the reserves. After their rigorous training, many midshipmen go on to have prominent careers within and outside the military, according to The Princeton Review.

Founded by the shipbuilder William Webb, this small, private college in Glen Cove, New York specializes in naval architecture and marine engineering. Every student receives a full scholarship to cover tuition and, along with little to no debt, they benefit from a 100% job placement rate upon graduation, according to the school.

The European Union is trying to prevent the United States from targeting the bloc's digital rules as both sides work through the final details of a delayed statement to formalize a trade deal reached last month, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

EU officials said disagreements over language relating to "non-tariff barriers," which the U.S. said include the digital rules, are among the reasons for the hold-up of the statement, the newspaper said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The European Union, the White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The statement had originally been expected days after the July announcement by EU President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump, according to FT.

The July deal imposed a 15% import tariff on most EU goods — half the initially threatened rate — and helped avert a broader trade war between the two allies, who together account for nearly a third of global trade.

The U.S. wanted to keep the door open for possible concessions on the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on U.S. tech companies, according to FT, which added that the commission has said that relaxing these rules is a red line.

The EU's DSA is a landmark law meant to make the online environment safer and fairer by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

The commission had anticipated that Trump would sign an executive order by Aug. 15 to cut tariffs on EU car exports to the U.S. from 27.5% to 15%. However, a U.S. official signaled that this would be delayed until the joint statement was finalized, according to FT.

The Republican governors of three states are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., at the request of the administration of President Donald Trump, who has portrayed the city as awash in crime.

The announcements on Saturday of troops from hundreds of miles away in West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio came a day after D.C. officials and the Trump administration negotiated a deal to keep Mayor Muriel Bowser's appointed police chief, Pamela Smith, in charge of the police department after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit to block the federal takeover of the department.

Trump, a Republican, said this week he was deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops to Washington and temporarily taking over the Democratic-led city's police department to curb what he depicted as a crime and homelessness emergency.

Justice Department data, however, showed violent crime in 2024 hit a 30-year low in Washington, a self-governing federal district under the jurisdiction of Congress.

West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey's office said in a statement he was deploying 300 to 400 National Guard troops to D.C. in "a show of commitment to public safety and regional cooperation." The statement said he also was providing equipment and specialized training.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster responded to a Pentagon request by announcing that 200 of his state's National Guard troops would be sent.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police members in the coming days, adding none of them were "currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state."

After the announcements, Mayor Bowser posted on X: "American soldiers and airmen policing American citizens on American soil is #UnAmerican."

The National Guard serves as a militia that answers to the governors of the 50 states except when called into federal service. The D.C. National Guard reports directly to the president.

Trump, who has suggested he could take similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities, has sought to expand the powers of the presidency in his second term, inserting himself into the affairs of major banks, law firms and elite universities.

In June, Trump ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, against the wishes of California's Democratic governor, during protests over mass immigration raids by federal officials.

South Carolina's McMaster said his troops would immediately return to South Carolina if needed to respond to a possible hurricane or other natural disaster. Hurricane Erin, now northeast of Puerto Rico, has become a catastrophic Category 5 storm that could bring ocean swells to the U.S. East Coast early next week, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Saturday.

National Guard troops often respond to natural disasters and rarely police U.S. civilians.

Drew Galang, a spokesperson for West Virginia's Morrisey, said the state's National Guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to D.C. late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment.

A White House official said on Saturday that more National Guard troops would be called in to Washington to "protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime."

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a formal order was expected to go out that would authorize National Guard troops in D.C. to carry firearms. The official said this order would affect mostly military police officers with sidearms. Reuters has reported that the National Guard troops would have weapons nearby, such as in their vehicles.

The White House said on Saturday that D.C. National Guard members have conducted patrols on foot and in vehicles around the National Mall and Union Station. The White House said the National Guard troops are not making arrests now and that they may be armed.

It is not clear how the administration could deploy National Guard troops elsewhere. A federal judge in San Francisco is expected in the coming weeks to issue a ruling on whether Trump violated the law with the Los Angeles deployments.

A scheduled visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi later this month has been called off, according to Indian news broadcaster NDTV Profit.

The visit that was expected to take place between Aug. 25 and Aug. 29 will likely be rescheduled, NDTV reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The report comes at a time when trade relations between the two countries have soured with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing a 25% blanket tariff on Indian exports, and topping those with additional 25% in duties — expected to come into effect on Aug. 27 — as a "penalty" for India purchasing Russian crude.

Both sides are in contact with each other, but a new schedule for talks has not been finalized, the report said.

Trump's cumulative 50% tariff rate on India is among the highest on any of the U.S.' trading partners, and has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi.

India has said it was being targeted unfairly, while calling out the EU and the U.S. on their continuing trade with Russia. "It is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]," the country's foreign ministry said in a statement earlier this month.

India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Office of the U.S Trade Representative did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.

The U.S. is India's single largest export partner, with nearly 20% of its overall exports, or $86.51 billion worth of goods, shipped to the U.S. in fiscal year ended March 2025, according to the latest official data.

When Astronomer ex-CEO Andy Byron and the company's HR head were caught cuddling on a jumbotron during a concert, the moral condemnation was followed by a collective question: Why would they risk their families and careers for a tryst?

As an executive counsellor and couples' therapist, I often spend my days sitting across from clients who are contemplating or already involved in similar situations. Most are not abusers, narcissists, or sex addicts who engage in serial cheating. They are good people: hardworking, kind, and devoted to their careers and families.

So, what makes a person — even one who swears they would never cheat — suddenly cross the precipice and risk everything for an affair?

Humans are wired to want the approval of others, and as social beings, our survival often depends on it. We "go with the flow," repressing our emotions to please those around us.

But like a spring that becomes more tightly wound with each passing year, this can quietly lay the groundwork for a violent recoil.

Here are five surprisingly common psychological pitfalls that can make someone risk everything for an affair.

Many of my clients who have engaged in extramarital affairs have always considered themselves to be "good." They listened to their parents, studied hard, landed a lucrative job, got married, had kids, and followed every societal expectation to the letter.

For them, love and acceptance in childhood were linked to achievement, and they often reach middle age without having a clear sense of who they really are. When an uneasy sense that "something is missing" inevitably starts to emerge, they sometimes turn to an affair in an attempt to fill the void.

It's no surprise that perfectionism is a trait I see in almost all of my high-performing clients. But perfectionism is often a response to trauma. Children in volatile environments or those given inconsistent approval often believe that doing everything perfectly will keep them safe.

Over time, they become weary of enforcing impossibly high standards on themselves and those around them. When an affair beckons, they may suddenly give up on trying to be perfect and double down in the opposite direction.

For them, an illicit relationship can feel like being set free from their own unrealistic expectations — a salve that softens the rigidity that has framed their lives.

People with weak boundaries often had parents who were somehow incapacitated — through addiction, poverty, feeling overwhelmed, or simple immaturity — and the role of providing emotional stability at home fell on their small shoulders.

Parentified children derive their sense of value from successfully anticipating and meeting the needs of others. But eventually, they start to feel resentful of the people they are "helping."

When an affair comes knocking, they rationalize it by telling themselves they have spent their entire lives giving to others, and now it is time to do something just for themselves.

As renowned couples' therapist Esther Perel points out in her book "The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity," the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the relationship.

Some of my clients engage in affairs after enduring years of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse. A secret relationship can be an unexpected but welcome reprieve from decades of unkind treatment.

It can also be a subconscious form of retaliation, a decision to blow up the relationship once and for all in an attempt to save oneself. There is no turning back once an affair is exposed, and scorched earth offers them a chance to start afresh.

One of the first questions I ask clients who are contemplating an affair is whether they have recently lost someone or something close to them. Grief is a catalyst, and it is often the death of a parent that triggers a reassessment of current relationships and priorities.

During this period of re-evaluation, boundaries become more permeable, which sometimes allows a party outside of the marriage to gain access.

Nobel laureate Albert Schweitzer is quoted as having said: "In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being."

It is this intoxicating sense of emotional enlightenment that makes many feel an affair is worth risking everything they once valued. Their world view narrows until every aspect of their lives outside of the affair partner is diminished in their field of vision. It is only in retrospect that things settle back into their correct scale and the situation can be viewed objectively.

For some couples, an affair can trigger the demise of a marriage that had already run its course. For others, it can prompt self-reflection and a renegotiation of the union's terms, allowing them to emerge stronger and better than before.

Professionally, the consequences can be career-altering and irreversible.

Learning how to advocate for yourself before you reach any emotional breaking point is both a personal and professional superpower.

This marks the biggest deployment of cryptocurrency payments in healthcare to date. The system runs on the XRP Ledger, offering pharmacies instant payments instead of waiting days for traditional bank transfers.

A major pharmaceutical distributor just made crypto payments a reality for thousands of pharmacies across America. Wellgistics Health rolled out its XRP-powered payment system on August 13, 2025, letting over 6,500 independent pharmacies process drug purchases using blockchain technology.

The XRP Implementation Program works through a partnership with RxERP, a pharmacy software company. Pharmacies can now pay suppliers and move money in seconds rather than the usual 1-3 days needed for wire transfers or bank payments.

The blockchain system cuts costs dramatically. Traditional bank wires cost $10-$30 per transaction, while XRP transfers cost less than $0.0002 each. For small pharmacy owners dealing with tight profit margins, these savings add up quickly.

Brian Norton, CEO of Wellgistics Health, said pharmacy owners understand the benefits. “Independent pharmacy owners are far more forward-thinking than many realize,” Norton explained. “They see the power of blockchain and understand how transformative this will be as it scales across the industry.”

The system handles compliance requirements that are crucial in healthcare. All payments meet HIPAA privacy rules and anti-money laundering laws. Every transaction gets recorded on the XRP Ledger, creating a permanent record for audits and tracking.

Independent pharmacies face serious cash flow problems with traditional payment systems. When they order drugs from suppliers, they often wait days for payments to clear. This delay makes it harder to restock inventory quickly when patients need medications.

The new blockchain system solves this problem by settling payments instantly. Pharmacies can now reorder supplies immediately after making payments, improving their ability to serve patients. The 24/7 operation means payments work even on weekends and holidays.

Wellgistics already serves more than 6,500 independent pharmacies and 200 pharmaceutical manufacturers nationwide. The company handles wholesale drug distribution and prescription routing services across the United States.

Wellgistics committed to blockchain technology earlier this year. In May 2025, the company announced it would hold XRP as a treasury asset alongside using it for payments. The company secured a $50 million credit line to support its blockchain infrastructure development.

The NASDAQ-listed company (WGRX) went public in February 2025 after being spun off from Danam Health. However, the stock has dropped more than 80% since its debut, closing recently at $0.62 per share.

Despite stock performance issues, Wellgistics continues expanding its blockchain initiatives. The company filed SEC documents outlining plans to use XRP for treasury management and capital raising purposes.

The healthcare sector is slowly adopting blockchain technology for various uses. The global blockchain healthcare market was worth $7.04 billion in 2023 and could reach $214.86 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Other healthcare companies have also started using cryptocurrency. Prenetics Global Limited, a health sciences company, bought 187 Bitcoin worth $20 million earlier this year. Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin for its reserves.

Wellgistics joins other companies that have added XRP to their strategic holdings, showing growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency for business operations.

The pharmaceutical industry processes massive amounts of payments between manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies. Blockchain technology offers transparency and speed that traditional banking cannot match for these complex transactions.

Wellgistics plans to expand the program beyond pharmacy payments. The next phase includes onboarding pharmaceutical manufacturers for direct blockchain-to-blockchain transactions. This would eliminate even more intermediaries from the drug supply chain.

The company also wants to launch direct-to-patient programs. These would let manufacturers ship medications straight to patients' homes while coordinating with pharmacies and doctors through the blockchain system.

Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan called the development “real utility and use for XRP and the XRPL.” He shared evidence showing that pharmacies are already joining the program, not just planning to join in the future.

The program currently operates in beta mode while pharmacies complete onboarding and training. Full 24/7 operations will roll out as more pharmacies join the system and become comfortable with blockchain payments.

Wellgistics has created the first large-scale cryptocurrency payment system in American healthcare. The XRP-powered platform offers 6,500 pharmacies instant, low-cost payments that could transform how the industry handles money.

Success of this program may encourage other healthcare companies to adopt similar blockchain solutions. For an industry known for slow adoption of new technology, Wellgistics is proving that cryptocurrency can solve real business problems in regulated sectors.

Oops, something went wrong

A viral Reddit discussion has reignited the debate over generational wealth-building strategies, with younger investors increasingly viewing Bitcoin as their answer to the housing crisis that has priced many out of homeownership.

The central thesis gaining traction among millennials and Gen Z investors is straightforward: while Baby Boomers benefited from purchasing homes at dramatically lower prices decades ago, today's younger generations face a different opportunity in the form of digital assets.

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to Federal Reserve data, the median home price in 1980 was approximately $47,200, while median household income was $17,710. Today, that same home costs over $400,000, while median income has grown to roughly $70,000—creating a far less favorable price-to-income ratio.

“You can't live in a Bitcoin,” critics often argue, highlighting the fundamental difference between a home as shelter and cryptocurrency as a speculative investment. However, Bitcoin advocates counter that traditional real estate comes with hidden costs: property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and what they call “entropic decay”—the inevitable deterioration of physical assets.

Proponents argue Bitcoin offers several advantages over traditional real estate investment:

Global Accessibility: Unlike real estate, Bitcoin can be purchased and held anywhere in the world without geographical constraints or minimum investment thresholds.

No Maintenance Costs: Digital assets don't require property management, repairs, or dealing with tenants.

Liquidity: Bitcoin can be sold instantly, unlike real estate transactions that can take months.

Portability: Cryptocurrency holdings can move with the owner, unaffected by local market conditions or political instability.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Despite Bitcoin's recent surge past $100,000, skeptics question whether the cryptocurrency is still “cheap” relative to its risk profile. The asset's notorious volatility means investors must stomach potential 50-80% drawdowns during bear markets—a psychological challenge that many underestimate.

Financial advisor perspectives vary widely. Some view Bitcoin as portfolio diversification, recommending allocations of 1-5% of total assets. Others warn against treating cryptocurrency as a primary wealth-building strategy, emphasizing the importance of emergency funds, retirement savings, and traditional investments.

The discussion reveals deeper frustrations with monetary policy and economic systems. Many participants blame Federal Reserve policies and fractional reserve banking for inflating asset prices beyond the reach of average earners, rather than targeting specific generations.

“The real enemy isn't Boomers—it's the system that debases currency and inflates assets,” one commenter noted, highlighting how monetary expansion benefits asset holders while disadvantaging new entrants to the market.

For those considering Bitcoin as a wealth-building strategy, experts recommend:

Only investing what you can afford to lose

Understanding the technology and market dynamics

Using secure storage methods like hardware wallets

Viewing Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, not a complete strategy

Preparing for significant volatility and extended bear markets

The fundamental question remains: Is Bitcoin the great equalizer for younger generations, or simply another speculative bubble that could leave investors worse off than when they started?

As traditional pathways to wealth become increasingly difficult to access, the answer may determine the financial future of an entire generation.

Bitcoin BTC$117,945.74 hovered near $118,348 on Sunday, up 0.39% in 24 hours, as two analysts outlined paths that could test traders' nerves: a dip toward $108K–$112K or a drawn-out range with room for altcoins.

Lark Davis argues that if bitcoin continues to slide, the most likely landing zone is $108,000–$112,000. That range served as a ceiling earlier this year when bitcoin's rally stalled, and in market psychology, levels that once blocked price often flip into support when revisited.

He emphasizes that this area also aligns with two classic pullback checkpoints known as the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements. These measures, drawn from the size of bitcoin's last rally, are widely watched because they often mark where profit-taking slows and new buying emerges. While Fibonacci ratios sound mathematical, in practice they work as self-fulfilling markers since many traders plan entries there.

Davis also points to the 20-week exponential moving average, a trend line that updates quickly with recent price action. When this line is rising into the same $108K–$112K area, it strengthens the case for support, because technical traders see both history and momentum meeting in one zone. 

When several signals cluster like this — resistance turned support, Fibonacci checkpoints and a rising average —traders call it “confluence,” and confluence zones often act like magnets for price tests.

In other words, Davis isn't predicting collapse but a healthy reset. His framework suggests that if bitcoin dips, buyers could step in around that band and fuel the next leg higher.

Michaël van de Poppe takes a different angle, noting that bitcoin was just rejected at a key resistance level near its recent highs. A rejection means sellers absorbed demand as the price tried to break out, a common signal that momentum needs to cool off before the next push. He expects the market to consolidate rather than trend, with bitcoin moving sideways between a floor and a ceiling while leverage resets.

The TradingView chart he shared underscores this. It showed bitcoin making repeated attempts at the top of its range but failing to hold above resistance. The candles formed wicks —price spikes that quickly faded — suggesting selling pressure was active near the highs. Underneath, the chart marked a zone of potential support, where Van de Poppe believes bitcoin could find a base before another breakout attempt.

For van de Poppe, the message is not about deep retracement but time. A sideways range would give the market breathing room, clear out overextended positions, and set the stage for the next move up. It would also open the door to rotation into altcoins, which often outperform when bitcoin stops trending.

That rotation, he suggests, could already be brewing. Once bitcoin stabilizes, traders typically seek higher returns in large altcoins like ether before spreading to smaller tokens. Altcoin rallies rarely start while bitcoin is in freefall, but they often gain momentum when BTC ranges and volatility cools.

In plain terms, the two analysts are describing different but compatible playbooks. Davis favors a deeper pullback into a support cluster that could refresh the uptrend, while van de Poppe sees a range-bound pause with potential for altcoins to shine.

For everyday readers, the checklist is simple: watch whether bitcoin trades sideways or dips to the $108K–$112K zone. In either case, analysts agree the broader bull market framework remains intact, but the path forward could look very different depending on how support and resistance play out in the weeks ahead.

Bitcoin BTC$117,945.74 hovered near $118,348 on Sunday, up 0.39% in 24 hours, as two analysts outlined paths that could test traders' nerves: a dip toward $108K–$112K or a drawn-out range with room for altcoins.

Lark Davis argues that if bitcoin continues to slide, the most likely landing zone is $108,000–$112,000. That range served as a ceiling earlier this year when bitcoin's rally stalled, and in market psychology, levels that once blocked price often flip into support when revisited.

He emphasizes that this area also aligns with two classic pullback checkpoints known as the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements. These measures, drawn from the size of bitcoin's last rally, are widely watched because they often mark where profit-taking slows and new buying emerges. While Fibonacci ratios sound mathematical, in practice they work as self-fulfilling markers since many traders plan entries there.

Davis also points to the 20-week exponential moving average, a trend line that updates quickly with recent price action. When this line is rising into the same $108K–$112K area, it strengthens the case for support, because technical traders see both history and momentum meeting in one zone. 

When several signals cluster like this — resistance turned support, Fibonacci checkpoints and a rising average —traders call it “confluence,” and confluence zones often act like magnets for price tests.

In other words, Davis isn't predicting collapse but a healthy reset. His framework suggests that if bitcoin dips, buyers could step in around that band and fuel the next leg higher.

Michaël van de Poppe takes a different angle, noting that bitcoin was just rejected at a key resistance level near its recent highs. A rejection means sellers absorbed demand as the price tried to break out, a common signal that momentum needs to cool off before the next push. He expects the market to consolidate rather than trend, with bitcoin moving sideways between a floor and a ceiling while leverage resets.

The TradingView chart he shared underscores this. It showed bitcoin making repeated attempts at the top of its range but failing to hold above resistance. The candles formed wicks —price spikes that quickly faded — suggesting selling pressure was active near the highs. Underneath, the chart marked a zone of potential support, where Van de Poppe believes bitcoin could find a base before another breakout attempt.

For van de Poppe, the message is not about deep retracement but time. A sideways range would give the market breathing room, clear out overextended positions, and set the stage for the next move up.

Can Ethereum tame the bull? This is a question that haunts more than one investor. Because behind its recent surge lies a very real but equally fragile shift. The market's second-largest crypto has delivered performances up to the point of nudging its all-time high. And yet… despite the enthusiasm, subtle but strong signs suggest a possible calm. Could the bull be tired?

This rise in power is not going unnoticed: the ETH/BTC ratio of crypto ETFs has tripled in three months, according to CryptoQuant. Translation: institutional investors, who still favored bitcoin, now seem to bet more strongly on Ethereum. In August, this ratio increased from 0.05 to 0.15, indicating a massive allocation shift within portfolios.

Another strong clue: Ethereum recently reached $4,743, its highest since 2021, nearing its all-time record. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC price ratio crossed its 365-day moving average – an indicator which, historically, signals phases of outperformance for ether.

Trading volumes do not lie either: for four weeks, the weekly spot volume of ETH has exceeded that of BTC. Latest figures: $24 billion versus $14 billion, according to CryptoQuant.

This growth is explained by a combination of factors: increased demand via ETFs, long-term investors rebalancing their positions, and a market sentiment leaning towards Ethereum use cases – staking, DeFi, tokenization.

Behind the encouraging numbers, some signals call for caution. Still according to CryptoQuant, ETH inflows to exchanges recently exceeded those of bitcoin. This suggests some holders are considering taking profits especially after such a rapid rise.

Another discreet alert: the ETH/BTC MVRV ratio rose from 0.4 to 0.8 between May and August, approaching the 0.9 threshold. For analysts, this level often indicates relative overvaluation of ether – a zone where reversals are common.

Add to this a surge in activity on ETH perpetual futures contracts, with open interest growing faster than bitcoin's. Interest is there, yes, but the higher it climbs, the greater the risk of a domino effect if profits are taken.

In short, Ethereum leads the dance… but the music might slow down. ETFs support the rise, but strong hands remain cautious about a potential consolidation.

To better grasp this moving dynamic, here are some key landmarks:

Ethereum enters a new era. Although the market sometimes wavers, signals converge: it is indeed the ETF and 401(k)-style retirement savings combination that could sustainably transform this network. No longer a mere altcoin, but a central infrastructure of tomorrow's crypto economy.

Ethereum price today is around $4,550, drawing attention as whales and institutional investors steadily accumulate large amounts of ETH, fueling optimism for a potential surge toward $15K.

This bullish sentiment comes at a time when institutional demand, ETF inflows, and Layer 2 adoption are reshaping Ethereum's market outlook. Analysts now believe Ethereum's combination of deflationary supply and whale accumulation could set the stage for one of its strongest rallies yet.

Ethereum price today remains under close watch as whales and institutions quietly accumulate massive amounts of ETH. Analysts suggest this buying pressure could be the catalyst for a significant rally, with projections ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 in the coming months.

Tom Lee, Managing Partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, made waves by forecasting Ethereum could “reach $15,000 by December,” highlighting the coin's strengthening role in institutional portfolios. His call comes as both retail and corporate investors look for the next big move in crypto markets.

Whale activity has intensified in recent weeks. According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one address believed to be linked to DeFiance Capital purchased 30,366 ETH worth $114 million in just 28 hours. This comes on top of significant institutional allocations such as BitMine Immersion Technology's purchase of over 106,000 ETH, valued at more than $470 million.

“The conviction of whales in current market conditions signals long-term confidence in Ethereum,” analysts at AMBCrypto noted. Despite volatility in spot trading, accumulation continues at scale, suggesting that smart money is positioning ahead of a breakout.

Fresh inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have also boosted optimism. CoinGlass data shows weekly inflows of $2.85 billion, marking one of the largest on record. Analysts point to ETFs as a key bridge for traditional investors entering the ETH market.

Meanwhile, the Layer 2 ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync continue to report rising transaction volumes and total value locked (TVL). This growth not only relieves pressure on Ethereum gas fees but also strengthens ETH's long-term utility and adoption narrative.

Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) transition has created a deflationary token model. More ETH is being locked in validator contracts, reducing circulating supply. At the same time, staking rewards have incentivized long-term holding.

As Standard Chartered noted in its recent report, “Ethereum's deflationary mechanism combined with institutional demand provides a unique setup for sustained price growth.” The bank has set a medium-term target of $7,500 but sees potential for $12,000–$15,000 if adoption trends continue.

From a technical perspective, Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates building momentum, though not yet at overbought levels. Futures markets tell a similar story: while the spot market has seen consistent selling, leveraged long positions are rising sharply.

CryptoQuant's futures volume data suggests whales are preparing for a potential squeeze. Futures leverage is climbing while spot selling continues, creating conditions for a sharp upward move once supply begins to thin.

The corporate sector is also leaning into Ethereum. Companies such as SharpLink and BitMine Immersion Technology have issued stock sales worth billions of dollars to build ETH treasuries.

This move reflects Ethereum's growing status not just as a decentralized finance (DeFi) asset but also as a strategic treasury reserve.

The convergence of whale accumulation, ETF inflows, deflationary tokenomics, and Layer 2 expansion provides strong bullish momentum for Ethereum. While some forecasts point to $10,000–$12,000 in the short term, more aggressive predictions, like Tom Lee's $15,000 year-end target, highlight the growing optimism surrounding ETH.

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and NFTs, a recent tweet from Adrian Newman has sparked intriguing discussions about wealth, taste, and the value of digital assets like Azuki. Posted on August 17, 2025, Newman emphasizes that being rich doesn't equate to having taste, and conversely, not being wealthy doesn't mean lacking it. He congratulates those who can afford high-end watches, noting they are decent pieces, while encouraging Azuki holders to celebrate their profile picture (PFP) affiliation with a prominent brand. This narrative ties directly into the NFT market, where Azuki has established itself as a blue-chip collection, blending cultural significance with potential trading opportunities.

From a trading perspective, Azuki's floor price has shown resilience amid broader crypto market fluctuations. As of recent data from OpenSea, the collection's floor price hovers around 5 ETH, reflecting a 2% increase over the past week, with trading volume spiking to over 1,200 ETH in the last 24 hours as of August 18, 2025. This uptick correlates with renewed interest in anime-inspired NFTs, positioning Azuki as a hedge against volatility in major cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC. Traders should watch support levels at 4.8 ETH, where historical buying pressure has prevented deeper corrections, and resistance at 5.5 ETH, which could signal a breakout if Ethereum's price rebounds above $3,000. Newman's tweet amplifies positive sentiment, potentially driving more holders to view Azuki not just as art, but as a status symbol comparable to luxury watches, thereby influencing on-chain metrics such as holder count and transaction velocity.

Linking this to stock markets, luxury goods sectors like watches from brands such as Rolex or Patek Philippe often mirror trends in high-end NFTs. For instance, when stock indices like the S&P 500 rally on positive economic data, institutional investors diversify into crypto, boosting NFT volumes. Recent reports indicate a 15% rise in institutional inflows to Ethereum-based projects in Q3 2025, according to Chainalysis data from August 15, 2025. Azuki benefits from this, with its brand partnerships enhancing scarcity value. Traders can capitalize on arbitrage opportunities by monitoring ETH/USD pairs on exchanges like Binance, where a 1.5% 24-hour gain in ETH as of 10:00 UTC on August 18, 2025, aligns with Azuki's floor price stability. However, risks include market-wide corrections if Bitcoin dips below $60,000, potentially dragging NFT floors down by 10-15% based on past patterns.

Beyond immediate trading, Newman's message underscores broader implications for crypto adoption. Holding an Azuki PFP isn't just about aesthetics; it's a bet on community-driven value in Web3. With over 10,000 unique holders and a market cap equivalent to $50 million at current ETH prices, Azuki offers long-term trading strategies like staking in related DeFi protocols or flipping rare traits during hype cycles. For stock traders eyeing crypto correlations, events like luxury brand earnings reports could indirectly pump NFT sentiment—think LVMH's quarterly results on August 20, 2025, which might highlight consumer spending trends favoring digital luxuries. In summary, whether you're trading watches or Azuki NFTs, taste and timing are key; savvy investors should integrate on-chain analytics with real-time market data to spot entries, such as buying dips below 5 ETH for potential 20% gains within a month.

This analysis highlights how cultural narratives like Newman's tweet can fuel trading momentum in the NFT space, encouraging a balanced portfolio approach that bridges traditional luxury with blockchain innovation.

- Crypto bridges enable cross-chain interoperability by transferring assets and data between blockchains using wrapped tokens.

- They operate via trust-based custodians or trustless smart contracts, with security risks highlighted by the $600M Ronin Bridge hack.

- Major bridges like Stargate and Wormhole facilitate transfers across ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and TRON while balancing speed, security, and decentralization.

- Users must evaluate bridge mechanics and risks, as these tools drive blockchain innovation but remain vulnerable to operational and technical flaws.

Crypto bridges are emerging as a pivotal innovation in the blockchain space, enabling interoperability between disparate ecosystems. These bridges allow users to transfer assets and data across different blockchains, effectively breaking down silos that have historically limited cross-chain communication. By creating artificial derivatives of native assets—known as wrapped tokens—crypto bridges allow users to spend tokens like Bitcoin in ecosystems that don't natively support them, such as Ethereum [1].

The process typically involves four steps: establishing a bridge between two blockchains, locking the native asset in a vault, minting a wrapped version of the asset, and transferring it to the target chain. This is facilitated through smart contracts and oracles that relay information between the chains. For instance, when moving BTC to Ethereum, the bridge locks the BTC, generates wrapped BTC (wBTC), and deposits it to the user's Ethereum address [1]. This mechanism ensures that the value of the asset is preserved during the transfer and prevents double-spending.

Crypto bridges are broadly categorized into two types: trust-based and trustless. Trust-based bridges rely on custodians to hold and manage assets, making them more susceptible to single points of failure. In contrast, trustless bridges use smart contracts and are generally considered more decentralized, though they are not immune to vulnerabilities [1].

Security concerns have been a significant issue in the crypto bridge space. The Ronin Bridge, for example, was the target of a high-profile hack in which over $600 million was stolen after hackers gained access to the private keys of network validators [1]. This underscores the importance of rigorous smart contract audits and thorough due diligence when selecting a bridge. Users are encouraged to research the operational history, transparency, and community sentiment surrounding any bridge before using it.

Several prominent crypto bridges have emerged to facilitate cross-chain transactions. Just Cryptos connects the TRON ecosystem to others, while Connext focuses on Ethereum Layer 2 interoperability without relying on external validators. Portal Bridge, formerly Wormhole, enables asset transfers across major blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum. Stargate stands out by eliminating the use of wrapped tokens, allowing direct transfers of native assets between chains [1]. Across Protocol offers fast cross-chain transactions for Ethereum and Layer 2 networks, and Celer provides a user-friendly interface for accessing assets, DeFi, and NFTs across multiple chains. Hop Protocol facilitates trustless and swift token transfers between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, utilizing liquidity providers known as Bonders.

These bridges are not only enhancing user experiences but also enabling developers to collaborate across ecosystems, thereby fostering innovation in decentralized applications [1]. However, users must remain cautious. Each bridge presents unique trade-offs between speed, security, and decentralization. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanics and risks associated with each bridge is essential before engaging in cross-chain transactions.

Crypto bridges are an essential component of the evolving blockchain landscape. They facilitate the movement of assets and data, enabling a more interconnected and functional web3 ecosystem. As the technology continues to mature, it is expected that bridges will play a central role in the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. However, with the risks inherent in cross-chain operations, users and developers must remain vigilant in their choices and implementation strategies [1].

A closely followed trader known for calling the market cycle top in 2021 says that a sizeable rally to much higher prices is still technically conservative for Bitcoin (BTC).

The pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave tells his 153,000 X followers that he's watching for a “conservative” Bitcoin price target above $150,000.

According to the analyst, BTC is currently travelling upward inside a large ascending channel, the upper bound of which suggests that the price target could be met by November this year.

Says Dave the Wave,

“BTC conservative technical target of $170,000.

In a manic, overheated market, [BTC] could go higher.”

The trader is also bullish on altcoins, recently noting an emerging weakness in the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart. Bitcoin dominance keeps track of how much of the crypto market belongs to BTC, and is often used as a gauge of altcoin strength.

Dave the Wave says BTC.D appears to be topping, which has historically coincided with altcoin upswings. He's targeting roughly the 42.5% area for BTC.D.

A downtrending BTC.D chart suggests that altcoins are rising in value faster than Bitcoin.

“BTC dom. Take your positions, ladies and gentlemen…”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,785, up over 101% in the last year, while BTC.D is hovering at 59.50%.

 Centrifuge joins BlackRock's BUIDL and Ondo Finance in the $1 billion RWA club as demand grows for tokenized products. 

Blockchain infrastructure platform Centrifuge has crossed $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), joining the ranks of BlackRock's BUIDL fund and Ondo Finance as the only real-world asset (RWA) platforms to surpass the milestone.

Centrifuge CEO Bhaji Illuminati attributed the milestone to institutions moving from pilots to “real deployments,” alongside strong onchain allocator demand.

“Markets need more than T-bills,” Illuminati told Cointelegraph, pointing to JAAA, an onchain version of Janus Henderson's AAA-rated collateralized loan obligation (CLO) investment fund, as a natural next step for institutions seeking higher yields than risk-free rates.

Illuminati said that US Treasurys remain the dominant entry point for onchain allocators, but the JAAA product is the fastest-growing tokenized fund in the segment. “We are also seeing rising interest in private credit as institutions look for differentiated yield, with more news coming soon on that front,” he added.

In early July, Centrifuge unveiled a tokenized S&P 500 product as part of a partnership with S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI). The product is structured as a regulated professional fund in the British Virgin Islands.

According to Illuminati, demand has been “very strong” ahead of its official rollout in the coming weeks. The launch will be supported by an anchor pool of capital to ensure broad accessibility from day one.

Illuminati added that the S&P 500 is only the beginning, with plans to bring sector-specific and thematic indexes onchain in the near future. “We see strong potential for sector and thematic index products to come onchain next,” he said.

Centrifuge's pipeline is split between traditional asset managers using  Web3 native asset manager Anemoy and onchain-native managers leveraging its RWA Launchpad. On the demand side, stablecoins and yield products are the biggest buyers, using RWAs to set a “yield floor” for reserves.

Illuminati highlighted plans to open tokenized assets to retail investors through major exchanges, wallets, lending protocols and DeFi integrations through the deRWA initiative. deRWA, as used in DeFi, stands for tokenized RWAs that are engineered for composability and liquidity within DeFi.

As reported, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) is also in discussions with major exchanges, custodians and DeFi protocols to license and list tokenized versions of its benchmarks, according to Stephanie Rowton, the firm's director of US equities.

“By establishing these types of relationships, we hope we can work together to participate in a robust infrastructure that supports the trading and accessibility of tokenized versions of our indexes, ultimately enhancing the investor experience,” Rowton said.

Looking ahead, Illuminati expects public market RWAs such as Treasurys and equities to lead adoption in the short term due to liquidity and familiarity. However, he believes private markets will eventually dominate, as blockchain removes inefficiencies and unlocks hidden value.

In a report earlier this month, Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimated that tokenized real-world assets could exceed $18 trillion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 53%.

Which is the most popular alt, according to ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Perplexity?

TL;DR



It's worth noting that this article does not aim to examine the three altcoins' market performance, price movements, or overall size (or any other honorable mentions that might appear from the AIs' answers). That's more than evident and can be reviewed on every big data aggregator such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.

It aims to explore the fan base behind these three. On why we chose ETH, XRP, and ADA in particular – it's simple – we usually see the most interest in articles related to them (and a few others, but they will appear later on, so stay tuned).

All four AIs tried to compare the altcoins by several factors, including market cap, which, as we said, we will leave out. Instead, we asked them to look for Google searches, social media engagement, projects' followers count, reposts, surveys, etc.

ChatGPT determined that the search interest and social media posts regarding Ethereum have risen to the highest levels since 2021, fueled by “ETF milestones and surging institutional interest.” However, XRP queries have “surpassed Ethereum's, reaching up to 10x more popular in global search data during the late 2024-2025 period.”

In ChatGPT's words, ETH and XRP lead in their own niches, while ADA trails behind both:

While OpenAI's chatbot was relatively political in its final answer, giving ETH and XRP essentially equal popularity votes, the other three AIs seemed conclusive and determined that the largest altcoin rules. However, that could be because they failed to exclude the market performance and dominance from the equation.

“While all three are highly popular altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) is the most popular and dominant by a wide margin, based on its market capitalization, extensive developer community, and the foundational role it plays in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem,” – said Gemini.

Perplexity was even more adamant about ETH's dominance:

“Ethereum is currently the most popular altcoin—by user base, institutional adoption, volume, and overall influence—far exceeding both XRP and ADA, as well as other trending contenders in the market.”

It also had a few honorable mentions outside of this trio, such as SOL, DOGE, and TON, all of which are “trending or gaining major traction in specific communities and narratives.”

Grok was the only one out of these three that acknowledged its inability to leave out the recent market performance (ETH is up by 22% monthly, while XRP is down by 13%). It added that ETH has attracted a substantial user and fan base, but XRP's community might be as loud or even louder on social media channels.

Ethereum Price Prediction is under the limelight as ETH trades at $4,415.95, decreasing by 1.08% at the time of writing. Despite this short-term decline, institutions are buying in big time and there is still long-term optimism for a drive towards $6,600, say analysts. In the meantime, fresh interest shifts to Remittix (RTX), an all-new ERC-20 token with real-world payment use case, which trades at $0.0944.

Ethereum has continued to withstand the unpredictable trading conditions. ETH continues to be the dominant smart contract platform with a market cap of $533.02 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $42.82 billion (down 24.56%). Institutional investors are apparently buying on a wide scale, pointing to confidence in the next leg of growth.

This institutional action continues to bolster the Ethereum Price Prediction, whereby a move above $6,000 can clear the path for new all-time highs. As institutions scoop up ETH, attention is also turning to upstart ERC-20 tokens like Remittix that combine blockchain innovation with real-world application.

Remittix (RTX) is a low gas fee cryptocurrency project designed for cross-border payments with ease. Unlike speculative tokens, it enables direct crypto-to-fiat payment to bank accounts in 30+ nations, targeting a $190 trillion payments market globally.

Momentum is already gathering, with over 603 million tokens sold and over $19.9 million raised. As soon as the presale exceeds $20 million, the team will be announcing its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, a huge milestone for liquidity and ease of access.

The project has also announced the beta wallet launch for Q3 2025, including real-time FX conversion, multi-crypto support and easy onboarding for freelancers and businesses. Investors now have a 40% token bonus and the chance to participate in a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway  incentivizing early adoption.

Remittix isn't another presale hype,  it's a cross-chain DeFi project solving a real-world payments problem. With low fees, fast transactions and mainstream use case, RTX is poised to be one of the best crypto presales of 2025.

For those investors tracking the Ethereum Price Prediction and searching for the next big altcoin of 2025, Remittix offers a rare combination of tech, adoption potential and early-stage growth. While institutions drive ETH's ascent, Remittix could be one of the top crypto under $1 that gets quietly positioned for mass adoption.

Is this the start of an altseason, or just another false alarm?



Altcoin liquidations have overtaken Bitcoin on Binance in 2025. While signs point to an incoming altseason, key indicators show the market is still in transition and awaiting full confirmation.

Speculative trading is heating up!

Altcoins have officially overtaken Bitcoin [BTC] in total liquidations on Binance [BNB] in 2025. With many traders betting that altseason will kick off in August, leverage is piling into volatile tokens.



Even Ethereum [ETH] whales are making hasty exits — one dumped stETH at a $50,000 loss amid a $3.96 billion unstaking queue.

In a sharp shift from 2024, altcoins are now seeing more liquidations than Bitcoin on Binance.

A recent CryptoQuant report showed that since early 2025, the cumulative liquidation delta has flipped in favor of altcoins.

The trend accelerated in July. Both long and short positions are getting wiped out, so traders are overleveraging in hopes of catching big moves.

As liquidations rise, so does market activity. Binance, being the largest crypto exchange, has a big role to play in the altcoin speculation wave.

Simply put, altcoins have become the main playground for traders chasing the next big rally.

Several indicators suggest that altseason could be brewing in August 2025, but it's not a done deal yet.

The altcoins market cap has broken out of a downtrend for the third time in two years, with past breakouts historically leading to 150x and 175x rallies.

The latest breakout hints at a potential 200x move, showing optimism and bullish sentiment across altcoins.

Meanwhile, CoinGlass' Altcoin Season Index stood at 53 at press time. This is above the neutral 50 mark, but not yet in full-blown altseason territory (typically considered above 75).

Altcoins are beginning to outperform Bitcoin, but the trend needs confirmation.

Reinforcing this is Bitcoin's dominance chart, which continues to fall, now sitting at 59.49%.

The market remains in transition. A confirmed altseason may require a continued drop in BTC dominance and a sharper surge in retail-driven altcoin inflows.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Solana leads public blockchain activity with 20.71M active addresses, surpassing BNB Chain and others.

- High-frequency trading (35M daily trades) and stablecoin adoption ($11B processed via USDC) drive its dominance.

- $204 price level and whale accumulation signal bullish sentiment, with staking growth reinforcing long-term investment appeal.

- Unlike XRP/Litecoin's short-term price spikes, Solana's sustained volume and DeFi utility highlight its infrastructure advantage.

- Growing ETF speculation and developer activity position Solana as a top crypto contender amid market volatility.

Solana remains the most active public blockchain network over the past seven days, according to on-chain analytics from Nansen. The platform recorded 20.71 million active addresses, outpacing BNB Chain (10.26 million), Base (7.192 million), Tron (6.317 million), and Sei (5.069 million) [1]. This continued leadership is attributed to Solana's robust infrastructure and high-frequency trading capabilities, with the network processing around 35 million daily trades—comparable to major financial marketplaces [1].

The platform's performance has been bolstered by a growing ecosystem, particularly in stablecoin adoption. Solana has become the third-largest chain for stablecoin transactions, with approximately $11 billion in value processed, primarily driven by USDC [3]. This reflects its increasing role in facilitating cross-chain value transfers and enhancing DeFi infrastructure.

Analysts highlight that Solana's current price level of around $204 has positioned it with a bullish outlook, with $200 serving as a key support level [2]. On-chain data also shows strong investor confidence, including whale accumulation and rising staking participation. These indicators suggest that both retail and institutional investors are viewing Solana as a solid long-term investment.

While the broader crypto market remains volatile, Solana continues to attract innovation and utility. Its ability to process transactions at a high volume and low cost has drawn attention from developers and users looking for scalable blockchain solutions. This is further supported by growing speculation around potential ETF listings and increased developer activity, making Solana a top contender among cryptocurrencies for investment [4].

In contrast to Solana's consistent on-chain activity, other chains such as XRP and Litecoin have seen price surges and increased mining interest but have not matched the sustained transaction volume and network usage observed on Solana [5]. This disparity underscores the importance of distinguishing between short-term price movements and long-term utility when assessing a blockchain's value.

As the market evolves, Solana's dominance in public blockchain activity highlights a growing preference for high-speed, low-cost infrastructure. With continued adoption of stablecoins and DeFi applications, the chain is well-positioned to remain a leader in the blockchain space in the coming months.

 The Treasury is considering embedding digital identity checks into DeFi smart contracts as part of its GENIUS Act consultation on crypto compliance tools. 

The US Department of the Treasury is seeking public feedback on how digital identity tools and other emerging technologies could be used to fight illicit finance in crypto markets, with one option being embedding identity checks into decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts.

The consultation, published this week, stems from the newly enacted Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), signed into law in July.

The Act, which sets out a regulatory framework for payment stablecoin issuers, directs the Treasury to explore new compliance technologies, including application programming interfaces (APIs), artificial intelligence, digital identity verification and blockchain monitoring.

One of the ideas in the request for comment is the potential for DeFi protocols to integrate digital identity credentials directly into their code. Under this model, a smart contract could automatically verify a user's credential before executing a transaction, effectively building Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) safeguards into blockchain infrastructure.

According to Treasury, digital identity solutions, which may include government IDs, biometrics or portable credentials, could reduce compliance costs while strengthening privacy protections.

They could also make it easier for financial institutions and DeFi services to detect money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion before transactions occur.

Treasury also acknowledged potential challenges, including data privacy concerns and the need to balance innovation with regulatory oversight. “Treasury welcomes input on any matter that commenters believe is relevant to Treasury's efforts,” the agency wrote.

Public comments are open until Oct. 17, 2025. Following the consultation, Treasury will submit a report to Congress and may issue guidance or propose new rules based on the findings.

Last week, several major US banking groups, led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), urged Congress to tighten rules under the GENIUS Act, warning that a loophole could let stablecoin issuers bypass restrictions on paying interest.

In a letter sent Tuesday, BPI said the gap could allow issuers to partner with exchanges or affiliates to offer yields, undermining the intent of the law. The group cautioned that unchecked growth of yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from traditional banks, threatening credit access for businesses.

 Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg's bear market warning comes as other industry executives don't expect a sharper downturn for Bitcoin anytime soon. 

Bitcoin may have no more than 27% upside left in this cycle before entering a downtrend, according to Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg.

“I think there is a greater than 50% chance Bitcoin goes to the 140 to 150 range this year before we see another bear market next year,” McClurg said during a CNBC interview on Friday. At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $117,867, meaning a move into that range would represent gains of 19% to 27%, according to CoinMarketCap.

McClurg warned of a broader economic bear market ahead, saying he isn't confident in the macroeconomic outlook. 

“I don't like the economic standing at all right now,” he said, arguing that the US Federal Reserve should have already cut rates at its last two meetings. He expects rate cuts to come in both September and October. Similarly, market participants are pricing in a 92.5% chance of a Fed rate cut in September, according to the CME Watch Tool.

McClurg attributed the majority of Bitcoin's recent price action to spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows and treasury firm purchases. “That's what is really driving price,” he said.

“We're seeing large allocations coming in, not just from small institutions but from large sovereign wealth funds, we're seeing insurance companies asking questions,” he explained.

While McClurg expects treasury firm buying to reach a peak in the coming months, he acknowledged that their impact has been significant.

Other Bitcoin advocates disagree with the idea of another bear market. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor said during an interview on June 11 that “Winter is not coming back.”

“We're past that phase; if Bitcoin's not going to zero, it's going to $1 million,” Saylor said.

Meanwhile, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said he doesn't expect the bull market to slow down anytime soon.

“I bet 2026 is an up year,” Hougan said in an X video on July 26. “I broadly think we're in for a good few years,” Hougan added.

- MoonBull ($MOBU) gains 100x crypto attention via exclusive whitelist offering early access, low pricing, and secret staking rewards.

- Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) leverages 600M+ TikTok views to tokenize a viral meme, creating community-driven investment opportunities.

- Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) expands its NFT ecosystem with a Solana-based token enabling staking, governance, and real-world metaverse integration.

- The projects highlight diverse crypto strategies: MoonBull prioritizes scarcity, CHILLGUY taps viral culture, while Pudgy Penguins blends NFT branding with blockchain utility.

MoonBull ($MOBU), Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are among the most discussed names in the current meme coin and NFT space, with each project drawing attention through unique value propositions and community engagement strategies. MoonBull, in particular, has attracted significant attention due to its structured whitelist system, which offers early participants exclusive advantages such as the lowest entry price, secret staking rewards, and early access to the project's roadmap [1]. These features position MoonBull as a potential 100x crypto contender, especially for traders who prioritize early access and scarcity in the crypto market [1].

The psychology of early entry plays a critical role in crypto's high-upside dynamics. Past launches have demonstrated that early participants in controlled-access projects tend to achieve the highest returns, often far outpacing those who enter later [1]. MoonBull's presale structure is designed to leverage this trend, with Stage One of the presale opening to the general public, but only whitelist members receiving advance notice of the launch time. This timing advantage can significantly influence entry strategies, particularly in fast-moving markets where early positioning often defines success [1].

Meanwhile, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is capitalizing on a viral TikTok meme with over 600 million associated videos, transforming a widely recognized cultural phenomenon into a tokenized community. This strategy provides a unique advantage by leveraging existing engagement and visibility, allowing CHILLGUY to build a strong foundation from the outset [1]. The token enables fans to participate in and invest in the meme's evolution, creating a bridge between digital culture and blockchain participation.

Pudgy Penguins, originally an iconic NFT collection, has evolved into a broader ecosystem with the PENGU token serving as a central utility asset. Built on Solana, the token supports transactions, staking, and governance within Pudgy World, while also facilitating real-world applications such as merchandise and metaverse integration [1]. This strategic expansion allows Pudgy Penguins to maintain its relevance beyond the NFT space and into a more diversified blockchain ecosystem.

Together, these three projects highlight the diversity in approaches to capturing market attention within the crypto space. MoonBull's focus on early entry and scarcity contrasts with Chill Guy's emphasis on viral culture and Pudgy Penguins' blend of NFT branding with blockchain utility. For traders seeking high-reward opportunities, MoonBull's limited whitelist is seen as a decisive edge, with the window to secure early access potentially closing quickly [1].

According to Greg Brockman, AI progress will soon deeply benefit the world via the discovery and production of new technology, emphasizing faster technological revolutions as the driver, source: Greg Brockman on X, Aug 17, 2025. The post includes no specific products, timelines, companies, or any mention of cryptocurrencies or blockchains, indicating no direct, immediate catalyst for BTC, ETH, or AI-linked tokens from this statement alone, source: Greg Brockman on X, Aug 17, 2025. Given the absence of actionable detail, traders can view this as a positive sentiment headline for AI-exposed equities and the AI narrative in crypto rather than a concrete trade signal until follow-up specifics appear, source: Greg Brockman on X, Aug 17, 2025.

Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI, recently shared a compelling perspective on how AI advancements could revolutionize global progress through the discovery and production of new technologies. In his tweet on August 17, 2025, Brockman emphasized that human progress is often measured by technological revolutions, and it's challenging to fully grasp the implications of AI accelerating this process. This insight arrives at a pivotal moment for investors, as AI's role in innovation directly influences cryptocurrency markets, particularly AI-focused tokens. As an expert in financial and AI analysis, I see this as a catalyst for trading opportunities in the crypto space, where AI narratives drive volatility and long-term value. Traders should monitor how such perspectives from industry leaders like Brockman could spark rallies in AI-related assets, correlating with broader market sentiment.

Delving deeper into Brockman's view, the acceleration of technological discoveries via AI could lead to breakthroughs in fields like materials science, energy, and biotechnology, fundamentally altering economic landscapes. For crypto traders, this translates to heightened interest in tokens tied to AI ecosystems. For instance, projects like Fetch.ai (FET) and Render (RNDR), which leverage AI for decentralized computing and rendering services, often see price surges following positive AI news. As of recent market sessions, FET has shown resilience with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $150 million on major exchanges, reflecting institutional interest. Traders might consider entry points around support levels of $1.20 for FET, eyeing resistance at $1.50, especially if AI hype builds. This aligns with Brockman's narrative, suggesting that AI-driven tech production could boost on-chain activity, increasing transaction volumes and token utility. By integrating this outlook, investors can position for upside in AI tokens amid a market where Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) provide foundational stability.

From a trading perspective, Brockman's emphasis on AI's role in technological revolutions correlates strongly with current market indicators. Recent data indicates that AI-related cryptocurrencies have outperformed the broader market, with a collective market cap growth of over 15% in the past month, driven by institutional flows into tech-heavy funds. For example, trading pairs like FET/USDT on Binance have exhibited bullish patterns, with a 5% price increase noted on August 16, 2025, at 14:00 UTC, coinciding with similar AI announcements. Volume spikes, reaching 120,000 trades in a single hour, underscore trader enthusiasm. Moreover, on-chain metrics from platforms like Dune Analytics show increased wallet activity for AI projects, signaling potential for sustained rallies. Savvy traders could use tools like RSI indicators, currently hovering at 60 for RNDR, to gauge overbought conditions and time entries. This ties back to Brockman's point: as AI facilitates new tech production, it could enhance blockchain applications, creating cross-market opportunities where stock gains in AI firms like NVIDIA spill over to crypto via correlated ETFs.

Looking ahead, the broader implications for stock and crypto markets are profound. Brockman's perspective highlights risks and rewards; while AI progress promises exponential growth, regulatory scrutiny on AI ethics could introduce volatility. In crypto, this might manifest as dips in AI tokens during policy debates, offering buy-the-dip strategies. For instance, if ETH, often used in AI dApps, breaks above $3,000 with a 24-hour change of +3% as seen recently, it could lift the entire sector. Institutional flows, estimated at $500 million into AI crypto funds last quarter according to reports from financial analysts, further validate this trend. Traders should diversify across pairs like RNDR/BTC for hedging, watching for correlations with stock indices like the Nasdaq, which rose 2% on AI-driven earnings. Ultimately, Brockman's insight encourages a forward-looking trading approach, focusing on long-term holds in AI assets while capitalizing on short-term volatility. This narrative not only boosts market sentiment but also positions AI as a key driver for the next crypto bull run, with potential returns amplified by technological revolutions.

In summary, integrating Brockman's view into trading analysis reveals actionable insights. With no immediate real-time data shifts, sentiment remains bullish for AI tokens, supported by historical patterns where similar announcements led to 10-20% gains within weeks. Keep an eye on trading volumes and price movements in the coming days, as this could signal entry points for maximized profits in the evolving AI-crypto intersection.

Rekt Drinks announced a collaboration with Base to release a limited-edition flavor called Based Lime. This sparkling water, featuring zero alcohol and zero caffeine, will be available online worldwide, at select Base IRL events, and at select Coinbase offices.

The announcement was made via a post on X by @rektdrinks on August 15, 2025, with the release date stated as “coming soon.” The collaboration with Base, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution backed by Coinbase, reinforces Rekt's strategy of partnering with prominent Web3 platforms to enhance its brand visibility.

Previous collaborations with OpenSea, Abstract, and Jupiter demonstrate Rekt's ability to leverage NFT infrastructure to drive product launches. The Base partnership extends this model by aligning with a platform focused on accessibility and scalability, potentially broadening Rekt's reach to a larger crypto audience.

By offering Based Lime at Base IRL events and Coinbase offices, Rekt taps into both physical and digital touchpoints, creating a hybrid engagement model that blends Web3 rewards with tangible products. This approach exemplifies how NFT culture can bridge digital assets with real-world utility, enhancing consumer engagement.

Rekt's success is rooted in its strong, engaged community, initially built around the free Rektguy NFT mint in 2022. The collaboration with Base continues to leverage this community by offering a collectible product tied to Web3 principles, such as potential rewards (e.g., DRANK points or $REKT tokens), which incentivize participation.

The equity distribution to Rektguy NFT holders in 2024, a pioneering move in Web3, aligns community interests with the brand's success, fostering loyalty. The Based Lime drop could further incentivize community engagement, potentially through additional token or point rewards, strengthening Rekt's dominance in community-driven brand building.

Rekt Drinks' prior success in selling over 600,000 cans and securing shelf space in 7-Eleven stores highlights its ability to transition from a crypto-native brand to mainstream retail. The Base collaboration could further this trajectory by associating Rekt with Coinbase's reputable brand, potentially easing skepticism from non-crypto consumers.

Potential for NFT-Driven Marketing Innovation

The collaboration could involve NFT-based mechanics, similar to past drops where NFTs were redeemable for physical products and tied to rewards like DRANK points, OpenSea XP, or Abstract XP. If Based Lime follows this model, it could introduce Base-specific rewards, further gamifying the purchase process and reinforcing NFT culture's role in innovative marketing.

The term “Based” aligns with Web3 and memecoin culture, particularly resonating with communities like those supporting $BRETT on Base. This cultural synergy could amplify Rekt's appeal among memecoin enthusiasts, potentially integrating $REKT token rewards to deepen engagement.

By tapping into Base's ecosystem, Rekt positions itself at the intersection of NFT and memecoin culture, potentially driving speculative interest in $REKT and reinforcing its cultural dominance in Web3. Rekt Drinks uses NFTs not just as collectibles but as a mechanism to bridge digital and physical products.

For instance, the Ship Rekt drop with OpenSea involved 7,500 NFTs, each redeemable for a 24-pack of drinks, alongside rewards like DRANK points and platform-specific XP. This model creates a “drink-to-earn” dynamic, where purchasing physical products yields digital benefits, a hallmark of NFT culture's innovation.

Community Ownership and Decentralized Branding

Rekt's adoption of Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licensing for Rektguy NFTs allows holders to create derivative works, fostering a decentralized approach to brand expansion. This has led to fan art, merchandise, and community-driven initiatives, amplifying Rekt's cultural footprint.

The equity distribution to NFT holders further embeds community ownership, aligning with Web3's ethos of decentralization. This model has helped Rekt build a loyal community that actively promotes its products, contributing to rapid sell-outs and mainstream traction.

NFT culture enables Rekt to transition from a digital art project to a physical beverage brand. The Rektguy character, initially a free NFT mint, has become a recognizable symbol that resonates with both crypto enthusiasts and mainstream consumers. Its imagery on drink cans creates a seamless bridge between digital identity and physical products.

The Rektguy character embodies the “rekt” ethos of crypto traders, turning market losses into a badge of resilience. This cultural resonance has made Rekt a Web3 phenomenon, with high-profile endorsements from figures like Snoop Dogg and Gary Vaynerchuk amplifying its reach.

By leveraging NFT-driven marketing, community ownership, and cultural resonance, Rekt bridges digital and physical markets, achieving rapid sell-outs and mainstream retail presence. The Based Lime drop could further amplify this by tapping into Base's ecosystem and Coinbase's credibility, potentially introducing new NFT or token rewards.

However, sustaining this dominance requires balancing crypto hype with broad consumer appeal, navigating market volatility, and addressing skepticism about NFT-driven products. Rekt's journey from a free NFT mint to a beverage brand in 7-Eleven stores exemplifies how NFT culture can redefine brand-building, positioning Rekt as a leader in the evolving Web3 consumer landscape.

Researchers at Tampere University and their collaborators from Germany and India have experimentally confirmed that angular momentum is conserved when a single photon is converted into a pair - validating a key principle of physics at the quantum level for the first time. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for creating complex quantum states useful in computing, communication, and sensing.

Conservation laws are the heart of our natural scientific understanding as they govern which processes are allowed or forbidden. A simple example is that of colliding billiard balls, where the motion - and with it, their linear momentum - is transferred from one ball to another.A similar conservation rule also exists for rotating objects, which have angular momentum. Interestingly, light can also have an angular momentum, e.g., orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is connected to the light's spatial structure.

In the quantum realm, this implies that single particles of light, so-called photons, have well-defined quanta of OAM, which need to be conserved in light-matter interactions. In a recent study in Physical Review Letters, researchers from Tampere University and their collaborators, have now pushed the test of these conservation laws to absolute quantum limit. They explore if the conservation of OAM quanta holds when a single photon is split into a photon pair.

One minus one equals zero

The conservation rule dictates, e.g., that when a photon with zero OAM is split into two photons, the OAM quanta of both photons must add to zero. Hence, if one of the newly generated photons is found to have one OAM quanta, its partner photon must have the opposite, i.e., negative OAM quanta. Or in other words, the simple formula 1 + (-1) = 0 needs to hold. While these conservation rules have been tested and utilized in a myriad of optics experiments with a laser, they have never been tested for a single photon.

"Our experiments show that the OAM is indeed conserved even when the process is driven by a single photon. This confirms a key conservation law at the most fundamental level, which is ultimately based on the symmetry of the process," explains Dr. Lea Kopf, who is the lead author of the study.

Finding the photonic needle in the laboratory haystack

The team's experiments rely on delicate measurements as the required nonlinear optical processes are very inefficient. Only every billionth photon is converted to a photon pair, such that measuring the conservation of OAM for single photons resembles the proverbial search for the needle in the haystack.

An extremely stable optical setup, low background noise, a detections scheme with the highest possible efficiency, and a lot of experimental endurance enabled the researchers to record enough successful conversions such that they could confirm the fundamental conservation law.

In addition to confirming OAM conservation, the team observed first indications of quantum entanglement in the generated photon pairs, which suggests that the technique can be extended to create more complex photonic quantum states.

"This work is not only of fundamental importance, but it also takes us a significant step closer to generating novel quantum states, where the photons are entangled in all possible ways, i.e., in space, time, and polarization," adds Prof. Robert Fickler, who leads the Experimental Quantum Optics group where the experiment was performed.

Looking forward, the researchers plan to improve the overall efficiency of their scheme and develop better strategies for measuring the generated quantum state such that in the future these photonic needles can be found easier in the laboratory haystack. Moreover, the researchers aim at leveraging the generated multi-photon quantum states for novel fundamental quantum tests and quantum photonics applications such as quantum communication and network schemes.

The entry of quantum computers into society is currently hindered by their sensitivity to disturbances in the environment. Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and Aalto University and the University of Helsinki in Finland, now present a new type of exotic quantum material, and a method that uses magnetism to create stability. This breakthrough can make quantum computers significantly more resilient - paving the way for them to be robust enough to tackle quantum calculations in practice.

At the atomic scale, the laws of physics deviate from those in our ordinary large-scale world. There, particles adhere to the laws of quantum physics, which means they can exist in multiple states simultaneously and influence each other in ways that are not possible within classical physics. These peculiar but powerful phenomena hold the key to quantum computing and quantum computers, which have the potential to solve problems that no conventional supercomputer can handle today.

But before quantum calculations can benefit society in practice, physicists need to solve a major challenge. Qubits, the basic units of a quantum computer, are extremely delicate. The slightest change in temperature, magnetic field, or even microscopic vibrations causes the qubits to lose their quantum states - and thus also their ability to perform complex calculations reliably.

To solve the problem, researchers in recent years have begun exploring the possibility of creating materials that can provide better protection against these types of disturbances and noise in their fundamental structure - their topology. Quantum states that arise and are maintained through the structure of the material used in qubits are called topological excitations and are significantly more stable and resilient than others. However, the challenge remains to find materials that naturally support such robust quantum states.

Newly developed material protects against disturbances 

Now, a research team from Chalmers University of Technology, Aalto University, and the University of Helsinki has developed a new quantum material for qubits that exhibits robust topological excitations. The breakthrough is an important step towards realising practical topological quantum computing by constructing stability directly into the material's design.

"This is a completely new type of exotic quantum material that can maintain its quantum properties when exposed to external disturbances. It can contribute to the development of quantum computers robust enough to tackle quantum calculations in practice," says Guangze Chen, postdoctoral researcher in applied quantum physics at Chalmers and lead author of the study published in Physical Review Letters.

'Exotic quantum materials' is an umbrella term for several novel classes of solids with extreme quantum properties. The search for such materials, with special resilient properties, has been a long-standing challenge.

Magnetism is the key in the new strategy

Traditionally, researchers have followed a well-established 'recipe' based on spin-orbit coupling, a quantum interaction that links the electron's spin to its movement orbit around the atomic nucleus to create topological excitations. However, this 'ingredient' is relatively rare, and the method can therefore only be used on a limited number of materials.

In the study, the research team presents a completely new method that uses magnetism - a much more common and accessible ingredient - to achieve the same effect. By harnessing magnetic interactions, the researchers were able to engineer the robust topological excitations required for topological quantum computing.

"The advantage of our method is that magnetism exists naturally in many materials. You can compare it to baking with everyday ingredients rather than using rare spices," explains Guangze Chen. "This means that we can now search for topological properties in a much broader spectrum of materials, including those that have previously been overlooked."

Paving the way for next-generation quantum computer platforms 

To accelerate the discovery of new materials with useful topological properties, the research team has also developed a new computational tool. The tool can directly calculate how strongly a material exhibits topological behaviour.

"Our hope is that this approach can help guide the discovery of many more exotic materials," says Guangze Chen. "Ultimately, this can lead to next-generation quantum computer platforms, built on materials that are naturally resistant to the kind of disturbances that plague current systems."

Sure, I was familiar with the graphic–and I'm not alone. Drop this image (right) on someone's desk and chances are they'll reflexively blurt, “Joy Division.” The band's 1979 Unknown Pleasures album cover leaned entirely on a small mysterious data display, printed in white on black. No band name, album title or other identifiers. An interesting move for a debut studio album.

The cover image became an icon but remained mysterious. Even as knowledge spread about the band's inspiration point–a preexisting pulsar data visualization (more on this below)–the true origin of that visualization continued to be a bit of a riddle. Somewhere along the way, I became obsessed with the narratives behind pulsar discovery and stacked plots, along with a growing desire to learn all that I could about the image and the research it was connected to. What follows is an abridged story borne of that obsession, starting with a video screened at a data visualization conference and ending with an interview with Harold (Hal) Craft, the radio astronomer who created the plot from data collected at the Arecibo Radio Observatory.

In late 2012 I saw the Unknown Pleasures album cover in a new light. VISUALIZED conference attendees were treated to a screening of Data Visualization, Reinterpreted: The Story of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures Album (directed by Eric Klotz and Volkert Besseling). Check out the video below for an interview with the album cover designer, Peter Saville.

As Saville explains, the cover is directly linked to a figure in The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy (1977 edition)–a stacked plot of radio signals from a pulsar. My interest was piqued. I'm far from a music and album art expert but visualizing astronomical phenomena is part of my job description. Although I jotted down notes, my intention to look further into things faded.

Then, nearly two years later, when chatting with artist Philippe Decrauzat about his influences, my jaw hit the floor. His collection of favorite 1960s and 1970s Scientific American graphics included the stacked plot. It had been printed as a full-page figure in the January 1971 issue; white radio pulses on a field of cyan. My interest was piqued anew, to say the least.

When folks refer to the Unknown Pleasures cover, they generally just say that it shows a series of radio frequency periods from the first pulsar discovered. But what does that really mean? How does the physicality of a pulsar result in radio frequencies that translate into the famous stacked plot? What produced the data, how was it collected, who created the plot and what is its significance?

First, a short pulsar primer (keep an eye on this blog in the coming months for a more in-depth discussion on the history of pulsar visualization and explanatory graphics). From Jacob Shaham's February 1987 Scientific American article “The Oldest Pulsars in the Universe:”

“[Radio pulsars] are thought to be rotating neutron stars: huge, spinning ‘nuclei' that contain some 1057 protons and neutrons…. The large clump of nuclear matter, which has a mass about equal to that of the sun, is compressed into a sphere with a radius on the order of 10 kilometers. Consequently, the density of the star is enormous, slightly greater than the density of ordinary nuclear matter, which is itself some 10 trillion times denser than a lead brick. Currents of protons and electrons moving within the star generate a magnetic field. As the star rotates, a radio beacon, ignited by the combined effect of the magnetic field and the rotation, emanates from it and sweeps periodically through the surrounding space, rather like a lighthouse beam. Once per revolution the beacon cuts past the earth, giving rise to the beeping detected by radio telescopes.”

Although the image on the cover is largely cited correctly as depicting the first pulsar discovered (CP 1919), it's not the first isolated plot of that pulsar, which was made in 1967. That honor goes to Jocelyn Bell Burnell from the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, England, as published in Nature on February 24, 1968. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.)

I quickly learned that I'm not the first to jump down the rabbit hole in search of the creator of the stacked plot. Adam Capriola has documented his search with regular updates, and notes three key pre-album occurrences of the figure. I checked out those three artifacts to see if they would lead to more information about the creator of the plot and/or its significance. In reverse order of printing:

1. The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy, edited by Simon Mitton. Prentice-Hall of Canada, by Terwin Copplestone Publishing, 1977. No source credit for the plot can be found in the text, other than a general book-wide “diagrams and graphs by Michael Robinson” nod. There's a great four-page summary about pulsars and several diagrams but not much detail about the stacked plot itself, beyond the figure caption.

“Successive pulses from the first pulsar discovered, CP 1919, are here superimposed vertically. The pulses occur every 1.337 seconds. They are caused by rapidly spinning neutron star.”

From The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy

2. Graphis Diagrams: The Graphic Visualization of Abstract Data, edited by Walter Herdeg, The Graphis Press, Zurich, 1974. Included in a catalogue of data visualizations on scientific topics, attributed on the credits page to the Arecibo Radio Observatory.

“Von einem Computer erzeugte illustration von achtzig aufeinanderfolgenden Pulsperioden des ersten Pulsars, der beobachtet wurde. Die Durchschnittsbreite der Pulse ist weniger als eine 50tausendstel-Sekunde. Das Diagramm wurde vom Arecibo Radio-Observatorium in Puerto Rico hergestellt. Aus Scientific American, 'The Nature of Pulsars,' von J. P. Ostriker (U.S.A.).”

From Graphis Diagrams: The Graphic Visualization of Abstract Data

3. “The Nature of Pulsars” by Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scientific American, January 1971 (pages 48-60); Credited to Arecibo Radio Observatory in the issue's illustration credit box on page 4. I'm clearly biased, but this article provides a neat and accessible view into the early days of pulsar data collection and theory (particularly when paired with “Pulsars,” by Antony Hewish, Scientific American, October 1968). It highlights the significance of the plot in the caption and hints to the nature of the research it was connected to (pulse shape and irregularity) but, sadly, doesn't directly name the plot creator as part of the Arecibo credit line.

“EIGHTY SUCCESSIVE PERIODS of the first pulsar observed, CP1919 (Cambridge pulsar at 19 hours 19 minutes right ascension), are stacked on top of one another using the average period of 1.33730 seconds in this computer-generated illustration produced at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico. Although the leading edges of the radio pulses occur within a few thousandths of a second of the predicted times, the shape of the pulses is quite irregular. Some of this irregularity in radio reception is caused by the effects of transmission through the interstellar medium. The average pulse width is less than 50 thousandths of a second.”

From “The Nature of Pulsars,” by Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scientific American, January 1971.

By now I had also combed through early discovery articles in scientific journals and every book anthology on pulsars I could get my hands on to learn more about early pulsar visualizations. The more I learned, the more this descriptor in the 1971 Ostriker caption began to feel significant; “computer-generated illustration.” The charts from Bell at Mullard were output in real time, using analogue plotting tools. A transition in technology from analogue to digital seemed to have been taking place between the discovery of pulsars in 1967 to the work being conducting at Arecibo in 1968 through the early 1970′s. A cohort of doctoral students from Cornell University seemed to be embracing that shift, working on the cutting edge of digital analysis and pulsar data output. One PhD thesis title from that group in particular caught my attention, “Radio Observations of the Pulse Profiles and Dispersion Measures of Twelve Pulsars,” by Harold D. Craft, Jr. (September 1970).

A trip to Cornell's rare book room confirmed a hunch. Sure enough, there was the image in Craft's thesis, along with two other stacked plots.

From “Radio Observations of the Pulse Profiles and Dispersion Measures of Twelve Pulsars,” by Harold D. Craft, Jr. (September 1970).

On February 16, 2015, I sat down with Craft just outside of Ithaca, N.Y., and asked him about his recollections of Arecibo, the data visualizations in his thesis and the Unknown Pleasures album cover.

Craft on pulsar research at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in the late 1960s:

Well, there were a number of graduate students who were down there at the time. Most of them were graduate students of Frank Drake. I was one of those, John Comella was another, Dave Richards was a third, I think Gus Zeissig might have been a fourth. As I recall, we were all together in one big room in the administrative building at Arecibo. And we were all actually pursuing a PhD thesis, experimental thesis in different stuff. And I, at the time, was doing radiometric temperature measurements of the surface of Venus, which didn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. I was working also on a new design for the line feeds for Arecibo, and that also didn't seem to be going anywhere. And then pulsars were discovered – not at Arecibo, obviously – by Jocelyn Bell at Cambridge. Arecibo, it turned out, was the perfect instrument to measure these things, because it had enormous sensitivity – easily the most sensitive instrument in the world at that time. It also had the rudiments of digital technology there, because it was a radar observatory, and the radar folks were using digital technology. Radio astronomy folks, including myself at the time, were primarily using – would you believe it – chart recorders, or very slow analogue to digital converters. So anyway, the instrumentation was all set up to make measurements on these things, and so a number of us turned immediately, saying, “hey, you know, this looks like an interesting thing to do.” Besides, Frank Drake encouraged us to focus on these, obviously a major scientific issue at the time, which we did. So all four of us focused on these, in different ways. And we just took off from there. It was an exciting time then. We were young graduate students, we didn't know squat. But, here's something new in astronomy that hadn't been seen before, and we were at the best instrument in the world to look at them, and what better opportunity was there than that? So we just hopped on it.

Craft on stacked pulsar plots, leading up to the CP 1919 data visualization:

This plotting of sequences like this, it started just a little bit earlier when we were looking at potentially drifting subpulses within the major pulse itself. So, the thought was, well, is there something like this peak here, which on the next pulse moves over here, and then moves over here, and over there. Actually, would be moving this way in that case – either way. I think Frank Drake and I published a paper in Science Magazine on exactly that issue – suggesting there might be drifting subpulses within the major pulse, which would then get back to the physics of what was causing the emission in the first place. So, then the thought was, well let's plot out a whole array of pulses, and see if we can see particular patterns in there. So that's why, this one was the first I did – CP1919 – and you can pick out patterns in there if you really work at it. But I think the answer is, there weren't any that were real obvious anyway. I don't really recall, but my bet is that the first one of these that I did, I didn't bother to block out the stuff, and I found that it was just too confusing. So then, I wrote the program so that I would block out when a hill here was high enough, then the stuff behind it would stay hidden. And it was pretty easy to do from a computer perspective. I also wrote a program that, instead of having these lined up vertically like this, I tilted them off at a slight angle like that so that it would look like you were looking up a hillside – which was aesthetically interesting and pleasing, but on the other hand, it just confused the whole issue.

Craft on preparing the original computer plots for thesis publication:

So what happened, just in the process of putting together the thesis, I would give this [see image below] to a woman draftsperson in the space sciences building at Cornell, and she would then trace this stuff with india ink, and make a much darker image of it, so that it could be printed basically.

Craft on the Unknown Pleasures album cover:

It was a complete surprise. In fact, I didn't know anything about it, and a colleague in the space sciences department, who is now a professor of astronomy at Cornell, Jim Cordes, saw me on the street – he's been a long time friend – and he said, “oh, by the way, did you know that your image is on the cover of Joy Division?” And, I said no, I had no clue. So I went to the record store and, son of a gun, there it was. So I bought an album, and then there was a poster that I had of it, so I bought one of those too, just for no particular reason, except that it's my image, and I ought to have a copy of it.

I appreciate that they call this out.  This means that if you're using Postgres primarily for storing data where it's ok if you lose a few (like time series data) then Clickhouse is the clear and obvious choice.But if the transactionality is key for you (like a financial application or the data for an application) then Postgres still makes more sense.

ClickHouse defaults to: "fsync_after_insert = false".A more fair comparison might at least do "SET synchronous_commit TO OFF" on the PostgreSQL side. (But for this UPDATE benchmark, I think the results would still largely be the same.)

As long as you can get away with Postgres, stay with Postgres. I'm sure this update here is a step forward just like version-merging is much better than cancelling rows but it's always got a ton of downsides.Unrelated to updating data, the CH defaults drive me insane, the null join behavior alone made me reconsider trying to rip CH out of our infrastructure (after wasting too long trying to figure out why my query "wasn't working").Lastly I'll say, if CH does what you need and you are comfortable learning all the ends and outs, then it can do some really cool things. But it's important to remember it's NOT a normal RDMS nor can you use it like one. I almost wish they didn't use SQL as the query language, then people would think about it differently, myself included.

We've been doing our best to address and clarify these differences, whether through product features like this one or by publishing content to educate users. For example: https://clickhouse.com/blog/postgres-to-clickhouse-data-mode... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ipwqfuBEbc.From what we've observed, the learning curve typically ranges from a few weeks for smaller to medium migrations to 1–2 months for larger ones moving real-time OLAP workloads from Postgres to ClickHouse. Still, customers are making the switch and finding value — hundreds (or more) are using both technologies together to scale their real-time applications: Postgres for low-latency, high-throughput transactions and ClickHouse for blazing-fast (100x faster) analytics.We're actively working to bridge the gap between the two systems, with features like faster UPDATEs, enhanced JOINs and more. That's why I'm not sure your comment is fully generalizable — the differences largely stem from the distinct workloads they support, and we're making steady progress in narrowing that gap.- Sai from the ClickHouse team here.

If you are needing updates then perhaps ClickHouse isn't the perfect choice. Something like ScyllaDB might be a better compromise if you want performant updates with (some sort of) consistency guarantees. If you need stronger guarantees you will need a "proper" database but then you're unlikely to get the performance. AKA tradeoffs or no free lunch.

reply

Either way, CH shouldn't be the store of truth when you need record level fidelity.

CH has been my favorite database since I discovered PostgreSQL 20 years ago. My view point is don't use postgres unless you can't use CH.

Prior to July 2025 (ClickHouse v25.7), ClickHouse did not support UPDATE statements. At all. Like most columnar, analytics databases. We spent a lot of effort designing and implementing a way to support high-performance, SQL-standard UPDATE statements. This test was pretty much just trying to see how good of a job we had done, by comparing ourselves to the gold standard, Postgres. (If you're curious, we also wrote about how we built the UPDATE support in depth https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-2-sql-styl...)We have some updates to the post in progress; we originally deliberately used cold runs for both ClickHouse & Postgres, because we wanted to look at the "raw" update speed of the engine, vs. the variability of cache hits. But TL;DR when you run a more "real world" test where caches are warm and Postgres is getting very high cache-hit ratio, its point updates are consistently ~2ms, while ClickHouse is somewhere ~6ms (bulk updates are still many multiples faster in ClickHouse even with the cache in play).

A test that would show PG's strengths over ClickHouse for OLTP would be a stress test with a long-running set of updates.ClickHouse maintains updates as uncompacted patches merged in the background, which is how you would do it with a columnar store. But if you have an update-heavy workload, these patches would accumulate and your query performance would start to suffer. PG on the other hand completes all update work inline, and wouldn't get degrading performance under update-heavy regimes.This is just a fundamental artifact of OLAP vs OLTP, maybe OLAP can be optimized to the point where it doesn't really matter for most workloads, but a theoretical edge remains with row-based stores and updates.

I'd wager the overhead in Postgres is probably lighter (though it's also light in ClickHouse), so you're right, this would be an interesting test. We actually had something like that planned, to run concurrent UPDATEs and SELECTs at different volumes for a period of time, to see how they each cope. Will definitely do it!

Did you run any tests with the new transaction system in ClickHouse? It would be super interesting to see how it effected the batch updates.

When you fry a chip is it obvious because you experience a zap?If so, then that would make all this "make sure you're grounded" ceremony less mysterious — because unless you feel a zap (even a tiny one) you probably haven't fried a chip, and it doesn't generally happen in environments where you don't feel zaps.Obvious caveat: "feeling" a zap is not a precise measurement.  But perhaps "zaps fry chips" is a lie which reveals a greater truth.

But one vital thing to understand is that a lot of those "vendor recommendations" exist to cover for rare 1% to 0.1% edge case failures.You can put together 20 PCs, with none of them dying from ESD, and conclude that ESD "isn't a real issue". But if you have a company that puts together tens of thousands of PCs per month? Then those ugly 0.1% edge case failures WILL pop up and they WILL cost you. And if you employ enough people, one of them might be a son of Zeus with a wild Wimshurst machine hairstyle - capable of emitting two high power ESDs, complete with an audible crackle and a visible spark, per minute. So ESD straps it is.The same applies to things like humidity control or reflow profiles for electronics. Not an issue ~99% of the time. The remaining ~1% can fuck you over in mass manufacturing, so disrespect the vendor at your own peril.

The ad seemingly says that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment, but its makers just want you to look closer.

A PhD student shared a photograph of an ad for the University of East London, implying that Wi-Fi is detrimental to the environment (h/t vx-underground). The poster says, “WiFi doesn't grow on trees. Your screen time is damaging the climate.” Although it's easy to assume that it's telling us that wireless networking is bad for the environment, a second look at the message focuses more on the time we spend in front of our phones, tablets, smart TVs, and computers, rather than on the Wi-Fi transmission itself.

Its initial message was intended to catch the attention of the public, with the ad showing a link to the organization's ‘Think Again' campaign that challenges the status quo. If you visit that page, you'll see that one of the topics covered there is society's use of social media and how it's pushing data centers across the globe to produce more emissions than those generated by the global airline industry. It goes on to show how the University is driving research to make data centers more sustainable, reducing the negative impact of our use of social media on the environment.

The poster doesn't really say that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment — it only tells you that it doesn't grow on trees. University of East London's ad did gather the interest of the people who saw it, especially as it seemingly contradicted something that most of us know as fact — that Wi-Fi is safe. It's quite effective, too. However, this ad can be easily misunderstood by some people, especially conspiracy theorists who think wireless technology is dangerous (like 5G) and are encouraging everyone to start wearing tin foil hats.

Nevertheless, we did see some hilarious responses to vx-underground's post, including users who were thinking about how it would be possible to use a router to cause actual harm to the environment by building a massive router that puts out high-energy microwaves. There are also a few who wanted to determine the actual energy consumption of every Wi-Fi device plugged into the outlet across the U.K., and some who are pondering the actual physical weight of the data transmitted across the waves.

Let's just hope that this jet never goes rogue.

Defense startup SkyDefense LLC just launched an autonomous combat drone designed to take out enemy drone swarms at a much lower cost than traditional weapon systems. The company calls it the CobraJet — an uncrewed aerial vehicle (basically, a drone) designed for C-UAS (counter-unmanned aircraft system) missions. The drone combines Teledyne FLIR electro-optical and infrared sensors that do not contain restricted foreign parts, and Nvidia AI chips, allowing the drone to process the information that it sees with onboard sensors.

The CobraJet is also equipped with its proprietary Visual Realtime Area Monitoring (VRAM) system, allowing ground commanders to monitor the drone during autonomous operations and communicate with and control it, if needed. This gives its operator the option to let it operate on its own during reconnaissance, patrol, and identification, but still have a human making decisions when required. It can also use the same technology to communicate with other CobraJet units, allowing them to act together as a single entity to protect against enemy swarms.

Aside from its AI brain, the CobraJet also boasts an internal weapons bay and external hardpoints, allowing it to carry kamikaze drones, small missiles, or even fragmentation projectiles. It can also be modified to carry precision bombs and loitering munitions, making it a multirole drone. Its external design mimics that of the U.S.'s latest air superiority and multirole fighters, the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, with vertical take-off and landing capabilities and thrust vectoring nozzles. This means it can operate from the back of a truck and have improved maneuverability, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with small and nimble drones.

CobraJet is SkyDefense's solution to the emerging threat of drone swarms on the modern battlefield. These small and cheap weapons are widely used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the defending Ukrainians effectively using drones to initially counter the larger Russian army. Today, both sides in the conflict use UAVs, and actions on the battlefield highlight the U.S.'s need to develop a cost-effective counter.

While existing weapons like surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles can engage drones, there's often a huge mismatch in price between these two platforms. Missiles often cost between half a million to more than $4 million — while you can buy a cheap drone for just $200, with the more sophisticated ones, like Iran's Shahed-136, only costing $20,000. You can also send up a platoon of combat choppers to engage a drone swarm with guns, but you're risking several multi-million-dollar weapon platforms to combat cheap suicide drones.



“Our USA-made CobraJets can communicate and coordinate as a flight team, enabling them to operate as an AI-powered unmanned Air Force,” said SkyDefense LLC President Nick Verini. “This team approach increases the effectiveness of the squadron while also significantly reducing the costs of destroying a swarm of enemy drones.”

SkyDefense LLC hasn't released the unit cost of the CobraJet, but it's going to be so much more affordable than the fighter jets it looks like, and the missiles they carry. The company is offering the drone to law enforcement, Homeland Security, and the U.S. military, giving them the ability to protect against hostile drone swarms without needing to spend copious amounts of money to take down such cheap weapons.

It's about 10 minutes into my interview with Mike Macdonald, and I get the sense that the Seattle Seahawks head coach is a little geeky. 

“Geek is a compliment,” he said. “I've been called a football nerd.”

Macdonald, 38, became the NFL's youngest head coach when he joined the Seahawks last year. He was also a straight-A student in high school and graduated summa cum laude with a finance degree from University of Georgia.

So it's not a big surprise that Macdonald embraces innovative tools and strategies. 

In an interview with GeekWire earlier this year at Lumen Field, Macdonald described his approach as a hybrid of traditional football fundamentals and modern technology. 

“We have a philosophy in Seattle: old school principals, new school methods,” he said. “We're going to build on a strong foundation, but whatever we can do to give us an edge — we're going to get after it.”

Thanks to advanced tracking and analytics, NFL teams have more data than ever — and it's changing how the game is played. One clear example: how coaches approach fourth down decisions.

“We have a way to measure the advantage you get for going for it on fourth down,” Macdonald said. “Every team has that.”

That data can shift play-calling not just on fourth down but throughout an entire drive, Macdonald said. 

Macdonald doesn't see analytics and instinct as mutually exclusive — instead, he views data as a decision-making tool to support what coaches already know from film, practice, and experience.

“It's a constant balance,” he said.

We spoke to Macdonald as part of an event showcasing Microsoft's partnership with the NFL, which now includes use of the company's Copilot AI software for scouting, allowing teams to get immediate insights by simply asking questions versus waiting for analysts to crunch spreadsheets.

“Earlier information is better,” Macdonald said. 

Macdonald, who was previously the Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator, last year became the first coach in franchise history to reach 10 wins in his first season. He'll try to top that mark as the Seahawks kick off their 2025 season next month.

We ended our chat with a little quick-hit Q&A.

Mac or PC? “I had a PC in college. I switched to Mac. But ever since I've been working in football, I've been on a PC.”

Favorite video game: “Madden. I've stopped playing the last couple years, but I love Madden. Loved NCAA back in the day. MVP Baseball 2005 was a great game.”

Favorite app: “Text message app. I get more text messages now, holy smokes.”

What should GeekWire readers know about you? “I'm an open book on this stuff. I think it's cool to be into stuff that is high-tech, data-driven. You're telling me you're smart and you're trying to find edges and trying to find new frontier — that's cool to me. It sounds like a winning formula.”

But it has been pulled for now.

Valve's latest Steam Client Beta has upped the ante when it comes to GPU monitoring, claiming its in-game overlay now delivers more accurate utilization readings than Windows Task Manager. According to Valve, Task Manager has historically under-reported GPU usage, particularly for games that launch auxiliary processes alongside the main one. Steam's revamped overlay captures all these processes, trims sampling errors, and aligns its stats more closely with trusted third-party tools like MSI Afterburner.

The reason Task Manager can be inaccurate is that it measures GPU usage on a per-process basis and relies on the GPU driver to report statistics according to the WDDM specification. Games that split work across multiple processes can therefore have portions of their GPU activity missed, and certain workloads can appear less intensive than they actually are. By aggregating usage across all related processes, Steam's overlay provides a fuller and more precise picture of a game's GPU demands:

"Net effect should be that in most games it's nearly the same as before, but in certain situations we previously underreported overall GPU utilization and the utilization number will now be higher and should closer match third-party tools like MSI Afterburner."



The quote above has since been removed from the patch notes page because Valve's confidence didn't last long under public scrutiny. Just a couple of days later, the beta update introducing this more accurate GPU tracking was quickly pulled from distribution. Now, the patch note reads: "It was later re-released to roll back a GPU utilization monitoring change that needs more testing." The inconsistency here suggests Valve is still validating the feature before pushing it stable, despite the bold messaging upfront.

This update follows earlier expansions to the overlay launched back in June, which introduced frame-level granularity like distinguishing between native frames and those generated by DLSS/FSR, alongside real-time readings of CPU load, RAM usage, clock speeds, and frame timing graphs. Those features have already transformed Steam's HUD into one of the most comprehensive in-game instruments—effectively matching tools like MangoHud and MSI's RivaTuner.

Combine that with the recently-added ability to display CPU temperature (on both Windows and Linux), enabled by a trusted CPUID-derived kernel driver, and it becomes clear: Valve is moving aggressively toward making the Steam overlay the central tech monitor for gamers, even if it means wading deeper into system-level access. This kind of behavior is commonplace in business today, where a dominant player will develop a homegrown version of something that was previously offered by a third party, essentially eliminating any need to venture outward.



That being said, gamers deeply invested in performance tuning, bottleneck diagnostics, and optimization, having accurate, server-less telemetry available via Steam—without relying on extra apps—could be a game-changer. It shifts hardware monitoring from niche third-party community tools into mainstream accessibility so newcomers and those less technically-inclined can also see the inner-workings of their computer, and more importantly, perhaps cultivate a new interest in it.

Still, users should tread carefully—especially when updating the GPU metrics which may still be unstable. Not to mention this is (was?) part of the beta client, meaning it's already early access and not meant for the general public. If it was pulled from even this channel then there's likely some serious tuning Valve is still experimenting with. But if the feature becomes widely available, in-game performance diagnostics just got a lot smarter for a lot more people.

The ad seemingly says that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment, but its makers just want you to look closer.

A PhD student shared a photograph of an ad for the University of East London, implying that Wi-Fi is detrimental to the environment (h/t vx-underground). The poster says, “WiFi doesn't grow on trees. Your screen time is damaging the climate.” Although it's easy to assume that it's telling us that wireless networking is bad for the environment, a second look at the message focuses more on the time we spend in front of our phones, tablets, smart TVs, and computers, rather than on the Wi-Fi transmission itself.

.@AndyMasley you're desperately needed on the London tube!! pic.twitter.com/femGSAgxv0August 16, 2025

Its initial message was intended to catch the attention of the public, with the ad showing a link to the organization's ‘Think Again' campaign that challenges the status quo. If you visit that page, you'll see that one of the topics covered there is society's use of social media and how it's pushing data centers across the globe to produce more emissions than those generated by the global airline industry. It goes on to show how the University is driving research to make data centers more sustainable, reducing the negative impact of our use of social media on the environment.

The poster doesn't really say that Wi-Fi is bad for the environment — it only tells you that it doesn't grow on trees. University of East London's ad did gather the interest of the people who saw it, especially as it seemingly contradicted something that most of us know as fact — that Wi-Fi is safe. It's quite effective, too. However, this ad can be easily misunderstood by some people, especially conspiracy theorists who think wireless technology is dangerous (like 5G) and are encouraging everyone to start wearing tin foil hats.

Nevertheless, we did see some hilarious responses to vx-underground's post, including users who were thinking about how it would be possible to use a router to cause actual harm to the environment by building a massive router that puts out high-energy microwaves. There are also a few who wanted to determine the actual energy consumption of every Wi-Fi device plugged into the outlet across the U.K., and some who are pondering the actual physical weight of the data transmitted across the waves.

The Camp Snap CS-8 doesn't care about frame rates, bit rates, or whether your footage is stabilized to unerring levels of steadiness. It doesn't want to replace your iPhone or compete with your mirrorless camera setup. What it offers instead is something far simpler and more deliberate: the feeling of shooting video for the sake of it.

Much like Camp Snap's point-and-shoot still camera from 2023 (the company's only other major product), it's a throwback to when cameras didn't think for you and when you didn't expect to review the images you just captured until later—sometimes much later.

Inspired by the Super 8 camcorders introduced in the 1960s, the CS-8 is unapologetically retro in both appearance and function. The body is mostly plastic, with faux-metal detailing and leatherette texture meant to evoke the mechanical era rather than mimic it convincingly. It's chunky and solid in the hand, albeit in a distinctly toylike way. If you're looking for authenticity, you're not going to find it here: There's a fake cold shoe up top and imitation screws at the base of the pistol grip. But that's not the point—this isn't Kodak's $5,000 Super 8 revival but rather a $199 camera meant to live in the real world and get passed around at parties, slung into backpacks for day trips, and used without a second thought.

There's no screen, no playback, and no Delete button. Here, what you shoot is what you get. The settings and options are stripped back, with one dial for selecting aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, 1:1, or 9:16) and another for the video effect. These include standard color, monochrome, and three lo-fi filters, including one that simulates the grainy, jerky look of 8-mm film.

I found that last one, labeled Analogue, was the star of the show. It drops the frame rate to 20 fps (it's 30 fps with the other modes) and sprinkles in digital scratches, resulting in footage that's imperfect in the most deliberate way. The rest of the filters feel a little flat by comparison, though the monochrome setting can conjure up its own punchy charm in the right lighting.

Using the CS-8 is refreshingly physical: Power it on by flicking a dial, press your eye to the rubber-cupped viewfinder, and squeeze down the trigger to record. There's no focusing to worry about here. The 8X zoom is handled with buttons labelled “W” and “T” for wide and telephoto, though it's digital-only, and resolution drops off quickly when you push in too far.

The viewfinder shows an appropriately cropped preview along with battery status, but it's not especially friendly to anyone who wears glasses. If, like me, you use specs, expect to see only part of the frame unless you're squeezed up uncomfortably tight. It's not a deal-breaker, but I did find it a constant irritation rather than part of the uncompromising retro charm.

Recording with the CS-8 feels more intentional than it does with a smartphone or a modern point-and-shoot camera. Here, you can't be distracted by the footage you just shot, because you can't see it until you get home. You can't delete it until you get home, either. There's no temptation to reshoot the same five seconds 10 times in search of something “perfect.” Simply shoot your scene, then move on. It's a welcome break from videoing something on your phone, then immediately checking to make sure it looks right; here, you feel like you're capturing a moment rather than curating one.

Storage is quite limited out of the box, but expandable. There's a 4-GB microSD card tucked behind a panel, which'll get you about 30 minutes of footage. Swap it out for something larger (up to 128 GB is supported) and you're good for up to 16 hours. Battery life offers roughly 30 minutes of continuous recording, and the camera charges via USB-C.

There's no wireless connectivity, no app, and no overcomplicated companion software to worry about; getting files off the camera means plugging it in and dragging them over to your computer. It might have been nice to have some built-in way to join all your clips into a single, shareable file, but I found it easy enough to do so using DaVinci Resolve.

Image quality is, predictably, not going to compete with a modern-day mirrorless camera or even a midrange smartphone. Videos max out at 2880 x 2144 resolution at 30 fps, but the bitrate is low, stabilization is nonexistent, and the mono audio is functional at best. You'll also hear the distinct sound of the trigger being pulled in almost every clip, reminding you that this is a camera with mechanical quirks, not a precision tool polished to perfection. The CS-8 captures exactly the kind of video you'd expect—it's not clean, smooth, or cinematic, but it's got character.

And character is the point. The CS-8 doesn't set out to be “good” in the traditional sense. Rather than promising professional results, it's designed to be fun. For kids, it's an easy introduction to video without the distracting noise and clutter of modern camera features. For adults, it's a throwback to a simpler time, encouraging creativity over quality. Its flaws are largely in service of the camera's philosophy. It wants you to treat video as something casual and spontaneous, not something to fuss over or optimize. And that approach can be surprisingly freeing.

Priced at $199 (early adopters can grab it for $149), the CS-8 sits in a strange but appealing niche. It's far from a necessity—you already have a smartphone in your pocket capable of outperforming it. But it knows exactly what it is: a playful and nostalgia-drenched tool for making memories that feel like memories the second they're captured. You don't buy this camera to create “content;” you buy it to capture moments without overthinking the whole process.

In that regard, the Camp Snap CS-8 is a success. It's not a video camera that'll appeal to everyone, but for those who can fully get on board with what it's going for, it's worth the price.

There are certainly real dynamics that make popular "conspiracy theories" resonate. The problem is such theories are overly simplistic tripe that play to people's gut feelings. They actually prove way too much, and mainly serve to obscure the real complexity of situations.

Pop-up screening for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk held at community pharmacies and large-scale sporting events can identify people with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors, according to a study published in JACC, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology, and simultaneously presented at the 73rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.

ASCVD is the leading cause of death worldwide but is often preventable in many cases. Regular preventative screenings can identify modifiable risk factors like elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated body mass index (BMI) and smoking, but many people aren't participating in screenings or receiving recommended preventative care. Although preventative health checks have been shown to reduce rates of ASCVD, implementation on a large community scale has been limited.

Heart health checks in the community can identify risk factors for future heart disease that can be managed by lifestyle changes or early preventive medications and save lives down the road. We saw in this study that screening in a variety of places in the community not only works to identify risk but showed that different types of risk were more prevalent depending on screening location, screening day and screening time."

Professor Stephen Nicholls, senior author of the study and director of the Victorian Heart Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia

In this study, researchers performed pop-up screenings at community pharmacies and an international cricket game to determine the number of participants who had uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors. Health stations were placed in 311 community pharmacies across Australia between Dec. 15, 2023 and Jan. 31, 2024. The health stations were available throughout the opening hours of each individual pharmacy, and screening performed before 5 p.m. was considered to take place during the daytime, while screening conducted after 5 p.m. was classified as evening. The health stations were also available for nine hours a day during an international cricket match played daily between Dec. 26-29, 2023. Screenings were performed as part of the Shane Warne Legacy Health Test initiative in memory of Shane Warne, an Australian cricket icon who suffered a premature and sudden death in 2022. The screening initiative was widely promoted to the public in advance.

Over 76,000 people were screened throughout the seven-week study period, with 89.8% screened at community pharmacies and 10.2% screened at the cricket match. Most participants were between 25 and 34 years old and male. Overall, 52,453 (68.9%) of participants met the primary outcome of having at least one uncontrolled risk factor: elevated BP reading, overweight or obese, or active smoker. Over one third (37.2%) of participants with recorded BP readings were in the hypertensive range.

There were higher rates of having at least one uncontrolled risk factor found among those screened at the cricket match vs. pharmacies. Most participants were between the ages of 35 and 64 years old and male. By individual risk factor, those at the cricket match had higher rates of elevated BP and BMI, but lower rates of smoking compared to those at pharmacies. About half of those with elevated BP readings had not had a BP check in the past year and over 80% were not on any antihypertensive medication.

At pharmacies, 24.3% were screened at rural pharmacies, where majority were over 45 years old and had higher self-reported rates of diabetes. Most screenings took place on weekdays in the evening. Compared to urban community pharmacies, those screened in rural pharmacies had higher rates of all risk factors and self-reported diabetes. About half of those with elevated BP readings had not had a BP check in the past year and almost 70% were not on any antihypertensive medications.

"Pop-up screening can be creatively nested into community-based programs and

events that are frequented by specific at-risk populations," Nicholls said. "These could direct screening efforts towards populations that could stand to benefit the most from ASCVD risk reduction while concurrently addressing disparities in access to healthcare."

A Medical University of South Carolina team reports in Frontiers in Immunology that it has engineered a new type of genetically modified immune cell that can precisely target and neutralize antibody-producing cells complicit in organ rejection. Similar strategies have been used to stimulate the immune system against certain cancers, but Ferreira's team is the first to show its utility in tamping down immune responses that can lead to organ rejection.

More than 50,000 organ transplants take place each year in the U.S. While often lifesaving, these procedures depend on a precise match between donor and recipient genes to avoid rejection. When the immune system detects foreign tissue, it can attack the transplanted organ.

For decades, doctors have used immunosuppressant drugs to lower the risk of rejection. But these drugs work broadly, suppressing the entire immune system. This can lead to side effects and shorten the life of the transplanted organ.

The MUSC team, led by Leonardo Ferreira, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Pharmacology and Immunology, showed the feasibility of targeted immunosuppression after transplant that could one day reduce rejection without leaving patients vulnerable to infection and other side effects. This strategy could also level the playing field for patients who have limited eligibility for organs because they are especially prone to rejection.

Jaime Valentín-Quiroga, first author of the article and a Ph.D. candidate at University Hospital La Paz in Madrid, Spain, working in the lab of Eduardo Lopez Collazo, Ph.D., is also co-advised by Ferreira. López-Collazo's research team provided the patient samples for the study.

Spain is one of the leading countries worldwide in organ transplantation and offers the perfect platform to move from bench to bedside. I am lucky to be co-advised by Dr. Ferreira. His research combines my favorite topics, fine-tuning the immune system and using cutting-edge biotechnology to enhance immune cells' natural functions."

Jaime Valentín-Quiroga, first author of the article

When in working balance, the immune system protects the body against outside invaders without attacking its own tissues. B-cells release antibodies that attack pathogens and infected cells. Regulatory T-cells, or Tregs, keep the immune response from going too far, preventing tissue damage and autoimmune diseases.

"When you prick your finger, it is important to mount a strong immune response to kill all the bacteria that entered your finger," Ferreira said. "But it's also important to bring that immune response to a halt when all the bacteria have been killed. Otherwise, you could lose your finger in the process, and the cure would be as bad as the disease."

A key target for B-cells are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins, which help the immune system to tell self from non-self. Doctors try to match donor and recipient HLA proteins as closely as possible, but with more than 40,000 HLA variants, perfect matches are rare.

One variant, HLA-A2, is found in nearly one-third of the global population. Patients who have had previous exposure to HLA-A2 are considered "pre-sensitized," meaning their immune systems are primed to respond to it and release very large amounts of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies. These include previous transplant patients; women who, during pregnancy, carried a child with HLA-A2 inherited from their partners; and recipients of HLA-A2-positive blood transfusions. Pre-sensitized patients have a much more difficult time finding a compatible donor organ.

Ferreira's team has developed a novel way for the Tregs to find and neutralize specifically the B-cells producing anti-HLA-A2 antibodies. They have fitted the Tregs with a CHAR – short for chimeric anti-HLA antibody receptor – which detects the appropriate B-cells and alerts the Tregs to suppress them. When CHARs detect and attach to B-cells secreting anti-HLA-A2 antibodies, they alert the Tregs to neutralize these problematic B-cells, essentially signaling the immune system to stand down and not attack the organ. In this way, not only do CHARs act like heat-seeking missiles to find the right B-cells to target, but they also hold the key to the Treg's ignition, activating its machinery to elicit a more precise immunosuppressive response and prevent it from going overboard.

Ferreira's team tested the efficacy of CHAR-Tregs in cells from dialysis patients with a history of kidney rejection. The cells showed high levels of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies, but exposure to CHAR-Tregs dramatically decreased antibody levels.

"We took patients' cells that have been shown to make an extremely strong response against HLA-A2-expressing cells, and we showed that the novel CHAR-Tregs calmed them down," said Ferreira. "I think that's the most exciting part of our study – we show that this strategy works in the cells of actual pre-sensitized patients."

Chelsea's much-anticipated return to Premier League action ended in frustration on Sunday as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, despite the celebratory atmosphere that welcomed the “Champions of the World” back home.

A huge banner honouring the club's recent FIFA Club World Cup triumph was unveiled in The Shed End before kick-off, but the mood quickly shifted as Chelsea struggled to break down a resilient Palace side.

The visitors thought they had taken the lead in the 13th minute when Eberechi Eze's thunderous free-kick flew past Djordje Petrović, only for the goal to be chalked off due to an infringement in the defensive wall.

For Chelsea, big-money summer signings João Pedro and Jamie Gittens failed to make a significant impact on their league debuts. Instead, it was 19-year-old academy graduate Josh Acheampong, starting in central defence, who impressed with a composed performance under pressure.

The Blues, who dismantled Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final last month and followed up with pre-season wins over Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan, were unable to reproduce that attacking fluency against Palace.

The home fans' chants of “We've won it all” gradually faded as frustration mounted with every missed opportunity.

One bright spark was Brazilian teenager Estevão, who injected pace and urgency after coming off the bench in the 54th minute.

The winger came closest to snatching victory late on when he met a Marc Cucurella cross, only to blaze his shot over the bar from close range.

Head coach Enzo Maresca will take positives from the resilience of his youthful side but knows his team must rediscover their cutting edge quickly if they are to mount a serious challenge in the league this season.

As of August 2025, 210 countries feature in the FIFA men's rankings - with East African nation Eritrea unranked as they have not played a competitive match in the last four years.

It has been claimed that their governing body often take the decision to postpone games to avoid players trying escape from the country and request political asylum when playing away games.

Eritrea are not banned from competing as they are still eligible to do so. However, 17 countries have been suspended from football - including one who remain unable to play in competitive fixtures.

Having hosted the 2018 World Cup won by France, Russia were banned by FIFA and UEFA in May 2022 - following on from the invasion of Ukraine and a plethora of European associations refusing to play them.

They were banned from the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024 as well as qualification for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Advert

In recent times Russia have played Belarus, Nigeria, Zambia and Grenada in unofficial friendly fixtures and Donald Trump has hinted at Russia returning.

At the first meeting of his administration's 2026 World Cup task force, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he hopes "peace will happen and Russia can be readmitted - which prompted the US president to reply, "That could be a good incentive, right? We want them to stop."

Fellow World Cup hosts South Africa were banned during the period of racial apartheid. It was lifted in 1963 following a visit from then-FIFA President Stanley Rous but his successor Joao Havelange expelled them in 1976.

Advert

The suspension was lifted properly in 1991 when apartheid was nearing its end and they won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996.

For different reasons, Mexico were banned from two tournaments because they fielded four overage players during a qualifying round for a world junior tournament.

Having been the hosts in 1986, four years later they were not allowed to complete at the showpiece in Italy, where West Germany went all the way.

In easily the most bizarre reason for a World Cup ban, goalkeeper Roberto Rojas used a hidden blade in his glove to cut himself in a qualifier against Brazil - and pretended he had been injured by a flare thrown by a fan.

Advert

His actions led to him being banned for life and his country suffered too as they were not allowed to compete at the 1994 World Cup.

In the 1950 World Cup, the first since 1938, Germany and Japan were barred due to their actions during World War II. Many years later, both went on to successfully host the tournament four years apart.

Pakistan were first suspended by FIFA when its federation's offices came under the control of an administrator, who had been put in place by a court in a move which breached FIFA's third-party rules.

Advert

A second suspension came in 2021 when a "hostile takeover" of the Pakistan Football Federation took place and then the hat-trick was completed when the association had failed to adopt a constitution approved by FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation amid governance issues.

It was lifted in March after the PFF agreed to comply.

In a similar timeframe, Congo were suspended in February following government interference. They were readmitted after FIFA were satisfied that the requested conditions were met.

Chelsea's Premier League campaign has begun with something of a whimper.

The FIFA Club World Cup champions looked under-prepared, a legacy surely of their summer exertions and late return to pre-season preparations, as Crystal Palace secured a point at Stamford Bridge. Enzo Maresca, a frustrated figure on the touchline, must have feared it might be like this.

With co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali watching on, Chelsea struggled for long periods to cope with Palace's aggressive approach. They might have trailed to Eberechi Eze's thunderous free kick early on, but the VAR determined Marc Guehi, grappling with Moises Caicedo in the penalty box, had moved within a metre of the Chelsea defensive wall when the shot was taken. The goal was therefore ruled out.

Chelsea's best first-half opportunity fell to Trevoh Chalobah, who skied over the bar from close range. The introduction of Estevao did inject some energy into their performance, but the forward players struggled to click and the better chances continued to fall to the visitors until stoppage time right at the end.

Then substitute Andrey Santos skied wastefully over the bar from inside the penalty box and with that effort went Chelsea's chance of a winning start.

Tim Spiers dissects the main talking points at a sun-drenched Stamford Bridge.

With Tosin Adarabioyo out injured and absent with a “small problem”, according to Maresca, teenager Josh Acheampong stepped up to fill Chelsea's Colwill-shaped hole.

Acheampong may have previously played a few games in the Conference League, started two Premier League games (including against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park last season) and even a Club World Cup group-stage appearance against Esperance, but this was surely the biggest game of his career; a chance on the opening day of the season to prove his worth and cement a place in the first XI.

He was handed a tough task against the intimidating, rampaging Jean-Philippe Mateta but, physically, the youngster held his own, staying tight to the Frenchman who only really unsettled him late in the second half.

Acheampong did look a little nervous early on — and one slack pass straight to Eze launched a Palace attack from which they won the free kick that led to their disallowed goal. He also played a careless ball across the defence in the second half that Palace almost capitalised upon.

However, Acheampong was by no means the only guilty offender here, with Reece James and Chalobah also playing misplaced passes as Palace's incessant press, applauded by Oliver Glasner, stifled Chelsea.

In that respect, they certainly missed Colwill. In fact, Chelsea arguably had more success when they went agriculturally long, with a couple of direct balls bypassing the press and getting them briskly on the attack.

Otherwise, Acheampong kept it pretty simple in possession. The highlight of his performance was undoubtedly an absolutely crunching challenge on Daniel Munoz after Mateta had sent the wing-back rampaging ominously down the right. It was a perfectly timed sliding tackle and then he was up on his feet to get to the loose ball ahead of Mateta.

The rabble-rousing moment brought Stamford Bridge to its feet.

Footballers need no excuse to make loud, vociferous appeals if they think they've been wronged in any way, but when Eze struck a thunderbolt of a free kick through both the Chelsea wall and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, it appeared to be a clean goal.

Eze and Palace celebrated wholeheartedly and Chelsea's players stood motionless, although their bench, led by set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva, were straight into the ear of the fourth official Michael Salisbury and it soon became clear why.

As Eze struck the ball, Guehi shoved Caicedo to one side, creating a gap through which Eze placed his shot.

However, the goal wasn't disallowed for a foul, as referee Darren England helpfully explained to the stadium in one of the new features of the 2025-26 season, saying: “After review, away No 6 is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.”

It turns out that, as of 2019, the laws of the game state that when three or more defending team players form a wall at a free kick, all attacking players must remain at least one metre from the wall until the ball is in play. So, quite correctly, no goal.

#CHECRY – 13' VAR OVERTURN

After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of goal to Crystal Palace.

Referee announcement: “After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a…

Chelsea both enjoyed and endured a mammoth season in 2024-25; it lasted 330 days and took in five competitions and 64 matches, starting on August 18 and ending on July 13.

Given how late it finished and that they have therefore had a truncated start to this season, starting pre-season training on August 4, 13 days before their Premier League opener, a lot of focus will be placed on how fatigued or fresh Maresca's players are throughout the campaign.

Conventional wisdom suggests they should be fine for now but may feel the impact later in the campaign, particularly if they go deep in the Champions League through a gruelling winter.

But there is no doub that this was a sluggish Chelsea display. They struggled to create chances, continuously ran down blind alleys and barely tested visiting goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

In fact, after the third minute, they failed to muster a solitary attempt on target until substitute Liam Delap's shot was saved in the 90th minute.

Credit should be given to Palace for the way they restricted space for the strangely subdued Cole Palmer, while Pedro Neto and debutant Jamie Gittens were often doubled up on by Palace defenders and rendered largely ineffective.

But Chelsea never found solutions to these issues. They enjoyed most of the play (around 70 per cent possession) but the tempo was far too passive and Palace found it easier to defend as the game went on.

So yes, Chelsea did look undercooked and lacking inspiration, but whether that was down to their Club World Cup exertions and a late start to pre-season, only they will know.

The one brief shining light of a flat and forgettable opening afternoon was the introduction of Estevao, who replaced Gittens in the 54th minute to a huge ovation.

A drab afternoon needed a lift and Estevao briefly provided it, skidding away from Guehi when he got his first chance to run at Palace's defence, before slamming a cross at Neto's head.

It was one of the game's best moments and the atmosphere was as loud as it had been all day.

The 18-year-old tried to give Chelsea what they needed; unpredictability and gusto. Not Malo Gusto, whose brainless 30-yarder into row Z in the 89th minute was met by howls of derision and summed up Chelsea's afternoon.

Estevao almost crowned his debut with a goal in front of Brazilian legend Romario, who was watching in the stands, but when meeting a cross in a great position he let the ball bounce off him before, off balance, blazing the ball over.

He also earned a very well deserved booking when wiping out Munoz as the Palace man looked to break. If orange cards were a thing, this was worthy of one.

Estevao certainly has the capacity to add excitement and thrills to Chelsea's play, as does his fellow Brazilian Joao Pedro, but in contrast this was a fairly forgettable Stamford Bridge bow for the former Brighton man. His struggles reflected those of the team as he often failed to find space and room to influence the game, often dropping off Guehi to link play but with nothing of note in front of goal.

Delap, in what could prove to be a familiar substitution this season, replaced Joao Pedro and was more unsettling for the Palace defenders, using his power and physicality to get into some great positions, but the finishing touch, as with all Chelsea's players, just wasn't there.

In fact, it was a third Brazilian, substitute Andrey Santos, who arguably had the game's best opportunity in stoppage time, a free shot just inside the box… but you could almost see what was going to happen when he took a big swing backwards of his left boot. Yep, miles over the bar.

It just wasn't Chelsea's day.

On whether Chelsea looked under-prepared: “I don't think so because, until the end, we competed. We tried to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao, with Andrey Santos. So that showed that probably we compete overall quite good. For sure, (Palace) have already played seven, eight games. And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes. So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better.”

On Acheampong's performance: “Very good, very good. We already showed confidence in Josh last year. He played already some games. Today he did very well, he dealt with Mateta very well. So overall, he did a good game.”

On Estevao's impact: “He was very good. He showed personality — he's already shown that in the training sessions. For sure, no doubt that slowly, slowly he will be a very important player for this club.”

New Chelsea signing Estevao came closest to snatching a winner, but the newly-crowned world champions were blunt in attack against a well-organised Palace defence.

Chelsea suffered a Club World Cup hangover as they were lucky to escape with a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace to open their Premier League campaign on Sunday (Aug 17). Palace were denied an early opener when Eberechi Eze's free-kick was ruled out by a VAR review for Marc Guehi obstructing the Chelsea wall. New Chelsea signing Estevao came closest to snatching a winner, but the newly-crowned world champions were blunt in attack against a well-organised Palace defence.

The Eagles' key duo, Guehi and Eze, started despite mounting speculation that the England internationals are set to join Liverpool and Tottenham, respectively. Eze thought he had opened the scoring with a blistering free-kick that had too much power for Robert Sanchez.

The goal was disallowed for Guehi's role in creating a gap by man-handling Moises Caicedo into the Chelsea wall.

Chelsea's demolition of European champions Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup last month had raised the Blues' hopes that they can

challenge for a first Premier League title since 2017.

Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro shone in the 3-0 win over PSG in New York 35 days ago, but were anonymous as Enzo Maresca had to turn to his bench for inspiration.

Estevao scored against Chelsea at the Club World Cup in his final game for Palmeiras. The Brazilian has been hyped as one of the world's brightest young talents, but lacked the composure to finish when he sliced high and wide from the middle of the box.

Nottingham Forest made light of manager Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-season fears with a dominant 3-1 win over a much-changed Brentford. Chris Wood struck twice, either side of Dan Ndyoe's debut goal for Forest, on a nightmare afternoon for new Brentford boss Keith Andrews. The Bees have lost their manager, captain and top scorer in the off-season.

Thomas Frank left to take charge of Tottenham, Mbeumo got his dream move to United, and Arsenal secured Christian Norgaard.

Yoane Wissa was also missing from the Brentford squad ahead of an expected move to Newcastle.

Igor Thiago's first goal for the club from the penalty spot late on was the only consolation for the visitors.

Arsenal, runners-up for the last three seasons, begin their quest for a first title in 22 years later away at a revamped Manchester United.

Chelsea's 2025–26 Premier League campaign got underway with a splutter as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.

The FIFA Club World Cup champions handed starts to new signings João Pedro and Jamie Gittens—the former given the nod over fellow new arrival Liam Delap—and teenager Josh Acheampong, who lined up alongside Trevoh Chalobah in central defence.

There was almost an early breakthrough for the Blues as Marc Cucurella's flicked header from Reece James's in-swinging corner was cleared off the line by Crystal Palace's Ismaïla Sarr, but ten minutes later it looked as if Chelsea had fallen behind.

A thunderous free-kick from Eberechi Eze. the in-demand attacking midfielder who is front and centre of Tottenham Hotspur's transfer radar, rocketed home from 20 yards out, bursting through the hands of goalkeeper Robert Sánchez.

But a little-known rule, infringed by Marc Guéhi, saw the goal ruled out, much to the delight of the vast majority inside Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea's response to the lift wasn't as you'd expect it to be. Enzo Maresca's side lacked any real cohesion, with Palace relatively comfortable throughout the remainder of the first half and for most of the second, and Jean-Philippe Mateta was denied by a smart save from Sánchez.

Estêvão was introduced ten minutes into the second half, replacing Gittens, and he had a big opportunity to open his Chelsea account soon after. The talented Brazilian couldn't control his effort, though, firing over the bar after Cole Palmer had managed to squeak a cross into Palace's penalty area.

Delap and Andrey Santos came off the bench too, making their Premier League debuts for the club, and the former was involved in creating a great chance for the latter in stoppage-time. Cucurella was also involved, squaring the ball for Santos after a tremendous touch from Delap, but he blazed his effort high over the bar to sum up the home side's afternoon.

The stalemate marked the first time in 2025 that Chelsea have failed to score at home, handing Palace a valuable point in what could turn out to be Eze's final appearance for the club.

The England international had a forgettable day as the Blues' new wonderkid outshone his fellow new signings in a dull Premier League stalemate

Chelsea were brought back down to earth after their Club World Cup triumph with a goalless draw against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

The home side, who won the United States-based competition just last month, started on the front foot when Marc Cucurella's looping header was cleared off the line by Ismaila Sarr. 

Controversy reigned in the 13th minute when Eberechi Eze's piledriver free-kick was ruled out as referee Darren England ruled for an infringement, following a VAR review, against Marc Guehi.

After being beaten for pace for Eze's effort, Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez did well to spread himself to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta soon after, as Palace turned the screw. Although Chelsea struggled to seize control of the game, Trevoh Chalobah should have made it 1-0, only for the defender to sky his shot from six yards.

Substitute Estevao Willian provided a much-needed spark for the west London outfit, but Chelsea still found it very difficult to break down a well-organised Palace side. In the game's dying embers, Community Shield winners Palace looked the most likely to break the deadlock, with Eze unleashing a drive that stung the hands of Sanchez.

Liam Delap had half a chance to grab a late winner, but his effort was easily handled by 'keeper Dean Henderson, and soon after, fellow substituteAndre Santos spurned a big chance, too.

In the end, both teams settled for a point, but Enzo Maresca's team need to improve a great deal if they are to be considered as Premier League title challengers.

The Eagles have reportedly already approached Club Brugge for Christos Tzolis and Leicester City for Bilal El Khannouss as potential replacements, with talks ongoing amid uncertainty over Eze's Selhurst Park future.

VALENCIA, Spain - Japan attacker Takefusa Kubo began the World Cup season with a bang on Saturday after grabbing a goal in the Spanish La Liga opener, helping Real Sociedad secure a 1-1 draw at Valencia.

The 24-year-old drew his side level on the hour mark at Mestalla by hammering home a 20-meter drive into the bottom right corner, scoring in the league opener for the third time in four seasons at Sociedad.

"My feel for the ball was somewhat not good (in the game), but it's positive to start with a goal," Kubo said. "There were lots of games I felt good playing but went without scoring last year, so I believe it's not a bad thing if I were to continue to have games like this."

Diego Lopez had thrown his body to poke home a long ball from deep to give Valencia the lead only three minutes earlier. Kubo provided an instant response with his goal, creating space for himself off a Brais Mendez layoff before finding the net with a crisp strike.

"I had my mind set on taking a shot but taking that tiny touch threw both the defender and goalkeeper off their timing. It worked well," he said.

Sociedad are looking to improve on their 11th-place finish last term with Kubo, linked with a transfer away after the club sold many of their key players in recent years, seen as a focal point under new manager Sergio Francisco.

"I think it'd be best to build confidence (at Sociedad) and head into the World Cup in good shape, reaching my peak condition there."

In the Netherlands, Ayase Ueda headed in a 22nd-minute leveler off a rebound as Feyenoord came from behind to win 2-1 at Excelsior, getting on the scoresheet for the second straight game.

Kento Shiogai came on to net a late brace as NEC Nijmegen claimed a 4-1 comeback win at Heracles.

It has been more than five years since Josh Sargent has scored a goal for the United States men's national team. But he couldn't be off to a hotter start for Norwich City in the EFL Championship after finding the back of the net against Portsmouth, potentially playing his way back into the national team picture.

Sargent has now scored goals in three consecutive matches to start the season for Norwich City. Leading the Canaries to a second consecutive victory, Sargent has become one of the best strikers in the English Championship, but with the World Cup looming, he has yet to make an appearance for the national team since March of 2025 in a loss during the Concacaf Nations League.

After Antonee Robinson and Christian Pulisic, Sargent is arguably the best-performing American for his club, and when looking at the 62 goals that he has scored for Werder Bremen and Norwich City, that is 10 more than Pulisic's 52 goals in that same span of time.

Even looking around the Championship, since the beginning of 2024, only Joel Piroe, Josh Brownhill, and Borja Sainz have scored more goals than Sargent's 17. With the national team, though, it hasn't translated, and the question is beginning to shift from will Sargent's scoring translate to the national team to why it isn't being prioritized.

Folarin Balogun, Patrick Agyemang, Ricardo Pepi, and Brian White have received the majority of starts under USA coach Mauricio Pochettino during his tenure so far, while Sargent has been left at home. With no one taking the reins for the starting striker role, it does make you wonder if Sargent will get another shot during the September international window. He has expressed that he wants to shine in a USMNT shirt, and Sargent also has a style that fits well with Pulisic in the attack.

Bringing plenty to a game, even when he's not scoring, he is being a menace while pressing and providing a strong aerial presence that works when his back is to the goal. That bore fruit when Sargent played with Borja Sainz at Norwich as alongside an inside forward on the left, Sargent can add assists to his goals.

If he's selected to face South Korea and Japan next month, it'll be another opportunity for Sargent to show what he can do, but the onus shouldn't just be on him. When looking at why a player's form from a club doesn't translate into the national team, sometimes it's about their specific performance, but other times, they warrant a change of the system to accommodate the player. With Sargent being one of the best American goal scorers over the past few years, there's no reason why Pochettino can't figure out what he has in a position of need. Sargent continues to do his part in putting the ball at the back of the net, and next, it needs to be done for the Red, White, and Blue.

There's a riveting sideshow that happens on the courts of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center during the US Open in Queens each year — and it has nothing to do with the famous players vying for the crown.

The event's quick-footed and eager “Ball Crew” regularly enthrall the crowds as they zip across the facility's famous blue arenas between every serve and volley to scoop up balls discarded by the likes of Naomi Osaka and Carlos Alcaraz.

There are 315 members of the agile work crew, and they range in age from 14 to their early 50s, according to team leader Neal Kitson.

Each person is put through a rigorous try-out that tests their agility and speed for grabbing balls off the court in the middle of game play.

This year, there were only 80 spots for newbies open. Out of 1,600 applicants, just 500 were invited to try out — and 420 were sent home. 

At 14 years old, Jayden Wong is among the youngest ball kids serving the iconic tennis tournament this summer.

“It definitely feels a little bit pressuring, but I like knowing that the older kids are watching over me,” said Jayden of Bayside, Queens.

“They have high expectations, but it's definitely not too hard on me — just knowing that we're all a team and that we're all just here to help each other out,” he said.

The ball boy said he was “surprised” earlier this summer when he learned he had been plucked from a pool of thousands of applicants to serve as a ball kid — a dream he'd had for as long as he could remember.

His deep-rooted passion for tennis sprouted when he first picked up a racket at age 6 to connect with his four older brothers, who were enamored with the game.

By age 10, Jayden was logging practices five days a week with the New York Junior Tennis League, and his family was capping off every summer with a trip to the US Open qualifying round.

“I would just go down there, see how fluid everything was and how everyone was together. And I thought to myself, I was like, ‘You know, one day I want to be down there. I want to be just like them,' ” Jayden said.

“I really felt that I had that ability just to play with them. And I had the skills to be in front of the top tennis players. I'm just really excited that I got selected.”

Akari Weintzen's first year as a ball girl was when Italy's Jannik Sinner took home the top men's trophy last year at the facility's centerpiece arena, Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Akari, 17, had originally requested off that day to prepare for her upcoming SATs — until Kitson called her and specifically asked her to work.

“Obviously I skipped SAT prep!” said Akari of Murray Hill in Manhattan.

“I couldn't believe that I was able to do that match. And it's what I'm most proud of in my whole life — to be able to say that I worked the men's finals is really cool.”

Akari herself first picked up a racket at 6 years old during an after-school program — and it was love at first swing.

She now plays for Junior Tennis, as well as her varsity team at Bronx Science High School.

For Olivia Chen, her four years on the Ball Crew have brought valuable life lessons along with lifelong friendships.

For her second year in 2023, Olivia, 18, was honored to serve as a member of the all-female Ball Crew on the court when fellow teenager Coco Gauff smashed her way into the history books.

“The whole year's theme was to honor Billie Jean King and her fight for equal prize money in tennis. I was chosen to be part of the all-female ball crew for the women's finals championship and, wow, it was just so empowering,” said Chen of Bayside.

“Billie Jean King came up to talk to us after the match had ended, and she explained to us what it was all for, and just getting to see so many confident females on court, getting to be on court with them too, it was just so empowering. It was amazing.”

The moment was a dream come true for Chen, whose parents had been taking her to the stadium since she was an infant.

While the US Open lasts three weeks every year — which some extra days tacked on for Ball Crew training — Chen emphasized that she leaves every tournament with a trove of memories and new friends from across the globe.

“It's just an incredible team. The sense of camaraderie is really there,” she said. “Our culture motto is: One team, one dream, and it's really something that we live by. 

“I know that if I look at anyone on the crew, they'll have my back on or off the court and I feel that same responsibility towards them. And it's just a blast. Ball Crew is so special.”

Coco Gauff's summer has not gone to plan since capturing her second Grand Slam title.

After clinching the French Open title in June, Gauff has struggled for form on the WTA Tour, losing to players ranked much lower than herself.

Gauff was stunned in straight sets by Dayana Yastremska in the Wimbledon first round before being knocked out of the Canadian Open by 18-year-old Victoria Mboko.

At the Cincinnati Open, Gauff was defeated by 2024 Wimbledon finalist Jasmine Paolini in the quarter-finals.

One notable figure, who has coached Maria Sharapova, has weighed in on Gauff's recent struggles.

Legendary tennis coach Rick Macci has a wealth of knowledge to share after years of coaching some of tennis' most high-profile figures.

The 70-year-old coached Serena and Venus Williams while they were growing up in Compton, California. Since then, Macci has also worked with Maria Sharapova, Jennifer Capriati and Andy Roddick.

Macci, a regular contributor to tennis discourse, has discussed Gauff's ‘career crossroads' ahead of the US Open, suggesting she needs a ‘science-based plan' to fix her second serve and forehand.

On X [Twitter] Macci said: “Coco will be OK as she fights and knows how to play. But to ever breathe rare air she has to address the alarming red flare. 

“She is at a career crossroad[s] with the second serve and forehand but needs a science-based plan. 

Coco will be OK as she fights and knows how to Play. But to ever breathe rare air she has to address the alarming red flare. She is at a career crossroad with the 2nd serve and forehand but needs a science based Plan. This will not magically go away and bubbles up more under…

“This will not magically go away and bubbles up more under extreme pressure that particular day.”

When comparing Coco Gauff's serve to her rivals, it is evident she has a major issue.

Over her last five matches, Gauff has averaged a whopping 9.2 double faults per match. Elena Rybakina is second on the list, averaging 4.2 double faults over the same period.

Gauff also has the lowest winning percentage on second-serve points over her last five matches. She has won 48.5 per cent of her second-serve points.

Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Jessica Pegula and Elena Rybakina have all averaged over 50 per cent in this category across their last five matches.

The American must correct this issue ahead of the US Open, or she may continue to struggle.

Novak Djokovic's season will resume directly at the US Open, which will start in New York in exactly one week and promise to give a great show. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz – who will be the protagonists of the Cincinnati Masters 1000 final tomorrow – will start as the top favorites also in the last Grand Slam of the season, but the Serbian legend can never be underestimated and will try to make tennis history for the umpteenth time by becoming the oldest ever to triumph in a Major.

The 38-year-old from Belgrade chose not to play official tournaments after his defeat to Sinner in the semi-final of the Wimbledon Championships, preferring to recharge his batteries together with his family and friends first in Croatia and then in Greece.

The former world number 1 missed the Masters 1000 in Toronto and Cincinnati, a choice that has caused some concern among fans and insiders. Nole has not played an official match on the hard courts since the Miami Open final against Jakub Mensik and would certainly have needed to find a rhythm in view of a tournament that promises to be very demanding from an athletic point of view (also due to the temperatures).

Although he has won four times at Flushing Meadows, Novak has always had an up-and-down relationship with this tournament and will also need a bit of luck when the draw is drawn.

During a recent interview with 'Tennis365', legendary coach Rick Macci discussed Djokovic's chances in NY: "In my opinion, he is the greatest tennis player of all time and can never be underestimated when a tournament of this importance starts. He can definitely win the US Open, but you need the right conditions.

If he has a very tough path and is forced to use a lot of energies during the first week, then it would become almost impossible to beat Alcaraz and Sinner in the final rounds. He will have to hope for a favorable draw and we will have to see how his body reacts to the various efforts."

 For the fourth time in the space of three months, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will face off with a big title on the line when they clash in the championship match at the Cincinnati Open. 

 The duo's red-hot Lexus ATP Head2Head series has already lit up Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 2025, and Monday's meeting at 3 p.m. EDT (9 p.m. CEST) in Ohio will once again have fans on tenterhooks waiting to see who can notch the latest success in one of sport's great ongoing rivalries.

 The No. 1 and No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, respectively, both Sinner and Alcaraz have been ‘scintillating in Cincy' so far this year. Defending champion Sinner has not dropped a set in reaching his eighth ATP Masters 1000 final and enters the match on a 26-match winning streak on hard courts. 

 “It's going to be a very, very difficult match, but hopefully it's going to be, in any case, a good match,” said Sinner after he downed Terence Atmane in the semi-finals. “Hopefully it's a very high-level match. That's what for us players is important, but also for the people who are watching… We will see what kind of fun is going to [happen] on Monday.” 

 Alcaraz may have dropped two sets en route to the title match, but the Spaniard has faced a tougher path than Sinner judging by his opponents' PIF ATP Rankings. He held off ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals before downing third seed Alexander Zverev in the last four, and the seven-time Masters 1000 champion will be full of confidence as he chases his Tour-leading sixth title of 2025. 

 “I'm excited about it. It's going to be great,” said Alcaraz ahead of facing Sinner in what will be his seventh consecutive tour-level final. “He won the last one, I won the first two finals, so I think it's going to be really interesting. It's the first final [between us this year] on a hard court, so I'm excited about taking that challenge. 

 “I know that Jannik, without a doubt, is the best player in the world on hard courts and probably on every surface right now, so it's going to be a great match and I have to be ready for that.” 

 After he let slip three championship points at Roland Garros in July to fall to a fifth consecutive defeat against Alcaraz, Sinner halted the Spaniard's momentum in their rivalry in style at Wimbledon in early July. The Italian clinched a four-set victory to seal his maiden title at SW19 and reduce his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against Alcaraz to 5-8. 

 For many, Sinner and Alcaraz's rivalry is defined by the contrast between the former's consistent all-around elite displays, featuring precise serving and cleanly struck groundstrokes, and the latter's sublime shotmaking genius and ability to string together unstoppable hot streaks when the stakes are at their greatest. Fans will be eager to see what sort of drama that intriguing combination produces on Monday in Cincinnati. 

 “The ability of not having any weakness,” said Alcaraz on Saturday, when asked what makes Sinner such a tough opponent. “It is crazy, the way he always plays at his best. It seems like you have to earn every point every game. He makes you suffer since the first point of the match until the last ball. The capacity of being there mentally, point after point, not having up and downs on the match makes him really, really special.”

 Both Sinner and Alcaraz have already qualified for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals, but the latter stands 1,540 points clear of his rival in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Sinner has the opportunity to cut Alcaraz's lead with victory in Cincinnati as both players chase ATP Year-End No. 1 present by PIF honours. Should Sinner triumph and improve his record for the season to 27-3, he would trail Alcaraz by just 1,190 points heading into the US Open. 

 On the other hand Alcaraz, who is 53-6 for 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, could extend his Live Race lead to 1,890 points by defeating Sinner to clinch his first Cincinnati crown. Victory in Ohio would also banish painful memories for Alcaraz at the Lindner Family Tennis Center, where he held a championship point in the 2023 final before losing to Novak Djokovic in a modern Masters 1000 classic.

This month, the National Bank Open and Cincinnati Open debuted their new 12-day formats — a first under the expanded ATP Masters 1000 structure. A landmark $18.3m profit-sharing announcement for 2024 has further boosted record compensation. It's all part of a broader ATP Tour shift: bigger events, greater long-term value, and more returns for players and tournaments. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi discusses the strategy, trade-offs, and what's next.

Q: The announcement of $18.3 million in profit sharing is a significant moment. How do you reflect on the progress of OneVision so far?
Having profit sharing at all is a sign of a healthy, growing ecosystem. And not just for players - it's also a strong indicator that tournaments are performing well. In just our second year of the strategic plan, $18.3 million is a big number. To put that in perspective, it's equivalent to a 25% increase on base prize money across the Masters 1000 category. That increase simply wouldn't exist under the previous system, and players now have full transparency on the tournament financials of our top tier events.

What excites me most, though, is the room for future growth. We're only scratching the surface. With the right foundations in place – expanded formats, stronger event infrastructure - we're unlocking new levels of investment, as Cincinnati has shown this year.

I have no doubt that profit sharing, together with the tournament expansions, will come to be seen as a transformational shift. Big reforms take time, and we need patience. But I'm confident the long-term growth they'll deliver will benefit everyone in the sport.

 

Q: Cincinnati's first edition as a 12-day event is launching in parallel with its new facilities. How important is that type of infrastructure investment?
It's crucial. The shift to a 12-day format gave tournaments the time, stability and confidence they needed to think bigger — and what's happening in Cincinnati is a perfect example.

They've undertaken a $260 million, multi-phase redevelopment that will lift every part of the event. For fans, it means more ticket availability and expanded stadium capacity, plus an upgraded on-site experience that matches the scale of a top-tier global event. For players, it's new locker rooms, improved recovery areas and better conditions across the board. For media, it's world-class broadcast infrastructure that helps elevate how the event is seen around the world.

And these aren't just cosmetic upgrades. The revenue generated by these improvements flows directly back to players through our profit-sharing model. This is exactly the kind of long-term, structural investment the sport needs — and it's only been possible because of the expanded format.

Q: What about the impact on the rest of the calendar, and player schedules?
The expanded format does increase time on-site, and that's a real consideration. But it also unlocks the revenue potential needed to elevate the entire Tour. Reforms like these were debated at length - with the Player Advisory Council, with the Board - over several years.

One of our clear strategic goals is to provide more money to more players. We've done it with the player pension expanding from 165 to 300 players, by more than doubling prize money at the Challenger level since 2022. And we're doing it though big events, with big stages and bigger draw sizes, that drive the commercial engine of the sport.

Just look at what's happening: record bonus pools, nine-figure infrastructure projects in Rome, Madrid, Shanghai, Cincinnati. None of this happens without the breathing room provided by the 12-day window. It's allowed promoters to reinvest and enabled a 50 50 share of profits. That's money flowing straight back to the locker room.

Some of the current tension undoubtedly lies in the different time horizons. We must think long term. Give this model five or ten years and I believe the Masters 1000s will have grown exponentially across all metrics and we'll look back at this move as the foundation of that shift.

Q: There's been a lot of debate about the length of the season, calendar complexity, and player fatigue. What's your view?
Across many sports, there's a clear trend toward more competition—just look at soccer, with the expanded Club World Cup that launched this summer. Our calendar is complex. It's a long season and going deep week after week is demanding. But this is also an individual sport: one player might be out in the first round, another is lifting the trophy after the final. Finding a solution that works for both ends of that spectrum is never straightforward, and you cannot build a calendar around just a single cohort of players. All cohorts must be considered.

Our goal at ATP is to extend the off-season. Proper rest benefits everyone—players, fans, and the quality of competition. But we can't act alone. Tournaments own their own licences, and any structural change requires alignment. We're in active discussions now, and I'm optimistic about the direction we're heading.

One point that often gets overlooked: players choose their own schedules. That freedom is rare in professional sport. But with that comes responsibility—knowing when to push and when to recover.

And finally we should be clear: ATP doesn't control the entire calendar. We work around Grand Slams, Davis Cup, and other fixed dates. That's exactly why OneVision proposes a unified governance model—bringing all stakeholders to the same table so we can make coherent, sport-wide decisions around things like the calendar.

Q: Do players have the right level of playing commitments?
We're always trying to find the right balance. As it stands, 19 events count toward your ranking — that becomes 18 next year. The mandatory list remains eight Masters. I don't believe that is excessive. Those marquee events are what give the season structure and create the revenues that now flow back to players—through record prize money, rising bonus pools and profit sharing.

Those events also anchor the storytelling of our whole season for the fans. Our job is to make sure the biggest stages are strong and reliable. When the top players turn up, fans respond, sponsors respond, and the whole sport moves forward. The numbers can always be tweaked, but the principle of a clear, premium spine to the season is non negotiable.

Players also need time to adapt to the changes we've implemented. The expansion of certain ATP Masters 1000 events equates to approximately 15 extra on-site days over the season. These added days must be factored in when building schedules, and it's only logical that players will need to scale back their commitments in other areas. Doing so requires discipline, as well as the willingness to forgo appearance fees when necessary. And of course, if a player exits early from a top-tier event, they retain the flexibility to select additional tournaments at lower levels to get more matches. Essentially, it's a top-down waterfall approach.

Q: What about when top players miss events, like Sinner and Alcaraz in Toronto?
Withdrawals are part of professional sport, especially in one as physically demanding as tennis. In this case, both Jannik and Carlos had deep runs to the finals of both Roland Garros and Wimbledon—an incredible achievement. With only a two-week turnaround between Wimbledon and Toronto this year, the schedule was particularly tight. Of course, I feel for the tournament. It was unfortunate but it's not the first time, and it won't be the last time a Masters 1000 event faces withdrawals. That's the reality of our sport.

In general though, when you step back and look at the data across recent years, player participation at the Masters 1000 level remains very strong. We need to assess the impact of reforms over time, using the full picture—attendance, viewership, player participation, compensation, and commercial performance. That's how we make informed, long-term decisions that serve the sport as a whole.

Q: How do appearance fees factor into all this when it comes to player scheduling?
Appearance fees are part of the landscape. They're not often talked about, but they move a lot of money, at the 500 and 250 level, where promoters regularly spend millions to secure big names. For top players, it's guaranteed income. I understand the appeal.

But players and their teams also have to be mindful of unintended consequences. Those financial incentives don't always align with what's best for a player's ranking, recovery, or long term career.

Q: Do exhibition events pose a problem for the ATP Tour?
Not necessarily. Exhibitions offer players another way to earn, and that's part of the freedom that comes with being an independent contractor. I don't take issue with the concept.

But we have to be honest: exhibitions benefit a very small number of players. They don't offer ranking points, they don't reinvest into the ecosystem, and they don't support the wider player base who rely on Tour events for their livelihoods.

That's why our focus has to remain on ATP events. They're the foundation of the sport—built to sustain hundreds of players, not just a few. When players choose to prioritise the Tour, they're strengthening the entire pyramid.

Q: What are the advantages for players to be independent contractors compared to some other team sports where they are employees?
There are trade-offs either way. Employees get more stability, but far less flexibility. Of course, employees lose their stability during strikes and employer lockouts. Independent contractors have freedom — to play where they want, build their teams, commercialise their brands, and attract income opportunities away from the Tour through exhibition events etc.

As an independent contractor you're not bound to the Tour the way an NBA or NFL player is tied to a collective-bargaining agreement, or as an employee in a team. If you don't want to play a tournament, you don't have to — zero-pointer rules and bonus-pools incentivize participation, but they don't force it.

At the same time, the Tour has built-in protections for players you'd normally only see under an employment model, like the player pension programme, or the Baseline financial guarantee for the Top 250. In other words, players retain control (schedule, endorsements, exhibitions) while enjoying many of the safety nets employees get. Plus, a say in every decision made by the Tour through player representatives that comprise 50% of the Board. That combination is rare in pro sport. In terms of the future, we remain open minded but you have to weigh the pros and cons of the various options, and importantly we need the Grand Slams to also be part of that conversation too, which is what we're advocating for under OneVision.

Terence Atmane's dream run at the Cincinnati Open has come to an end.

The Frenchman wowed peers and fans alike, defeating a host of high-profile names on his way to the semi-final stage.

Atmane, who also won two qualifying matches, defeated Flavio Cobolli, Joao Fonseca, Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune in Cincinnati.

His impressive run was halted by world number one Jannik Sinner, who won their contest 7-6 6-2.

However, the 23-year-old should be proud of his Cincinnati performance. Defeating the players he has takes talent and skill, not luck.

As expected, the Frenchman's ranking has skyrocketed following his performance in America, resulting in him overtaking a Grand Slam finalist.

Back in 2014, Kei Nishikori produced multiple displays of jaw-dropping tennis to reach the US Open final.

The Japanese star defeated Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic on his way to the final, before losing to ATP stalwart Marin Cilic in the final.

Since reaching the final, Nishikori has endured an unfortunate, extended period with injuries. During his career, the Japanese player has suffered from hip, ankle, knee, groin, and shoulder issues.

Nishikori has demonstrated incredible resilience to return to the top 100, after being ranked as low as 576 in 2023.

Before the Cincinnati Open, Nishikori was ranked 65 in the world. However, his first-round loss to Camilo Ugo Carabelli has seen him drop 23 places to world number 88, as per the ATP Live Rankings.

Meanwhile, Terence Atmane's ranking has increased dramatically. The Frenchman was ranked 136 in the world before the Cincinnati Open, but has since risen 67 places to world number 69.

Brad Gilbert, the former coach of Kei Nishikori, Andre Agassi and Andy Murray, took to social media to praise the 23-year-old Frenchman during his match against Jannik Sinner.

On X [Twitter], Gilbert said: “Throw the rankings out the window. Atmane is giving Sin City [Sinner]all he can handle.

“So cool to see this happen, and shows how deep tennis is at the moment.”

throw the rankings out the window 🪟 Atmane is giving Sin City 🌆 all he can handle, so cool 😎 to see this happen and shows how deep tennis 🎾 is atm

Atmane could be one to watch at the US Open after his performance in Cincinnati. The tournament starts on August 24 and ends on September 7.

Coco Gauff is not heading into the US Open in the form that she would have liked to have been in.

Gauff was beaten by Jasmine Paolini in the Cincinnati Open quarterfinals, in her second consecutive defeat to the Italian.

It was not a tidy match from either player, but particularly Gauff, who hit 62 unforced errors and 16 double faults.

As a result of her latest defeat, Gauff could now be overtaken by Iga Swiatek in the WTA rankings.

The serve has been a big issue for Gauff throughout the North American hard court swing so far, but she has still managed to find a way to come through a lot of matches in spite of it.

However, when discussing concerns ahead of the US Open, former top 10 singles player and Grand Slam doubles champion Chanda Rubin explained how she noticed Gauff's demeanour being more negative towards her team against Paolini.

“But Coco Gauff, she won Roland Garros, she made a tough transition onto the grass, she figured kind of, tough turnaround, she had a lot of things going on, she didn't quite get it going there,” Rubin said on Tennis Channel. 

“Now to start the hard court swing, she's won a few matches, she's won some matches here, didn't have to play a couple of matches. But I just thought she might be in a bit of a better place. 

“We saw it with the double faults, she handles it so beautifully, but we saw her start to get a little bit frayed, get a little irritated, kind of direct it to her team there, so that for me would be the only concern.

“How is she feeling? Does she feel confident she can work through some tough matches in New York? Does she have enough matches behind her on the hard courts? 

“So, that would be my concern, but certainly she has that ability, she has the athleticism to turn it on and in New York she gets such incredible energy, I think that's going to go a long way for her. But certainly, the game was a little frustrating for her, certainly yesterday against Paolini.”

While there are big concerns for Gauff heading into her home major this year, there are also some about world number one and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka as well.

This is something that former top 10 player CoCo Vandeweghe has spoken about, pointing out Sabalenka's major final defeats at Roland Garros and the Australian Open already this year.

Vandeweghe commentated on her most recent defeat against Elena Rybakina, where she claimed Sabalenka was simply unable to dictate play like she is usually able to.

“I think I got to say Sabalenka, honestly,” said Vandeweghe. “Because she has been so close but has fallen short so many times. She's been world number one, she is the one that is supposed to have so many titles. I just feel like losing a couple of Grand Slam finals, losing early now, considering this is an early loss for a world number one. 

“I think we got to call question marks as to where she is at, because that beating that Rybakina gave her, Chanda and I called that match and it was, she didn't even have a say so in what was happening out there and for a big hitter that is definitely a gut check of, ‘I just got out-played in my own game style, now what do I do?'. 

“I think for Coco, it's still the same as what we have seen in previous years, but her competitiveness and her tenacity has gotten her through, and especially…she shines in these Grand Slams. So, I'm not as worried for Coco as I am for Aryna.”

Former world number one Lindsay Davenport then weighed into the discussion, claiming Sabalenka has more pressure as Gauff has already won Roland Garros this year.

When voicing her concerns about the Belarusian, Davenport called Sabalenka's backhand ‘a little bit of a mess'.

“We are talking about two players whose sole goal is to win majors, and to win the US Open, so looking at both of them I think it's equal, I agree with you guys,” said Davenport. 

“If you look at Sabalenka, as CoCo said she has had so many heartbreakers this year, she is going into the last major and she has not won one yet this year, so even more pressure on her. Little bit less on Gauff, because hey she won Roland Garros, so at least when the season's over she has at least one major. 

“But, when you get to the point where you are holding more than one Grand Slam it becomes about winning more majors. 

“Sabalenka, she got outhit. Her backhand is a little bit of a mess right now, she is going to have to figure some technique there, use her legs more, way too many errors from that side. And Gauff looked exasperated last night that this was still happening on her serve. You just hope that this doesn't come up at the US Open when the pressure is even more.”

Both Gauff and Sabalenka will be hoping to correct these frailties in their games by the time the US Open comes around.

They will both go straight into singles, which begins on Sunday, August 24, after Sabalenka revealed she would no longer be playing US Open mixed doubles.

Térence Atmane is making headlines in the tennis world after his stunning run at the Cincinnati Open. The 23-year-old French qualifier shocked everyone by reaching the semifinals of the Masters 1000 event, a performance that caught the eye of tennis legend Martina Navratilova and sparked calls for him to receive an emergency US Open wildcard.

Tennis expert Jon Wertheim was so impressed with Atmane's Cincinnati performance that he made a strong case for an emergency US Open wildcard. Wertheim wrote:

“A serious attaboy for Atmane…. Taking out Cobolli, Fonseca, Fritz, and Rune (and finally going down to No.1 Sinner 7-6, 6-2) is worthy of an emergency @usopen main draw wild card….”

This is where veteran Navratilova stepped in with her support. The nine-time Wimbledon champion responded to Wertheim's post with a simple but powerful two-word reaction:

“Agreed 100…”

Agreed 100…. https://t.co/2wZWDMO0Jx

— Martina Navratilova (@Martina) August 16, 2025



Navratilova's endorsement carries significant weight. She won four US Open singles titles and reached the final eight times. The tennis icon is one of the most successful players in tennis history, with 59 Grand Slam titles under her name.

Currently, Atmane is listed as an alternate for the US Open main draw. His ranking at the start of Cincinnati was 136, which was not high enough for direct entry. However, his semifinal run has boosted him to around number 69 in the live rankings.

Atmane's path to the semifinals was nothing short of spectacular. Before this week, he had only one tour-level win all season. He came through qualifying without dropping a set, setting the stage for what would become one of the most remarkable breakthrough performances in recent memory.

In the main draw, he defeated Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka in the first round. Next came his upset of 15th seed Flavio Cobolli in a tough three-set battle. He then beat rising star Joao Fonseca in straight sets, building momentum with each victory.

The real shocks came in the fourth round and quarterfinals. First, he stunned fourth seed Taylor Fritz, the top American player, in three sets. The victory over Fritz was his first Top 10 win and came on American soil, making it even more impressive. He then backed it up with a straight-sets victory over seventh seed Holger Rune. The 6-2, 6-3 win over the Danish player secured his place in the semifinals.

Following his quarterfinal win over Rune, Atmane wrote ‘Fermi's Paradox' on the camera lens, which had the whole world in confusion.



His incredible run finally ended against world number one Jannik Sinner in the semifinals. Despite losing 7-6 (4), 6-2, Atmane showed his skill by not facing a break point in the opening set and pushing Sinner to a tiebreak.

Atmane became the first qualifier to reach the Cincinnati semifinals since 2015. He also became the first Frenchman to reach this stage since Richard Gasquet in 2019, cementing his place in tournament history with this breakthrough performance.

Highgate's Holly Brewester became a finalist on the manicured lawns of Wimbledon after an unforgettable experience at SW19.

Brewester, 13, who attends Highgate School and lives in Highgate, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Brewester, who described Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka as her tennis icon, finished runner-up in the girls' U14 singles final – and revealed it was an experience she will never forget.

She said: "It's a really good feeling to make the final because I've been here the whole week fighting to make it.

"I played really well in all of my matches and even though I didn't get the result that I wanted.

“I know a few people here that I've played with before and the environment is nice, it's quite calm. The people here treat you really well.

"It's really inspired me to carry on my tennis because it's so amazing to be at Wimbledon and hopefully I get here as a professional one day.

“Hopefully I will go pro, it would be great to do that. It's amazing being here so it does feel like that is a little bit more possible."

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025, with Brewester representing Coolhurst Tennis Club.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories also included wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals also saw the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid were in attendance to cheer on the youngsters at SW19 and offer his experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

“This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition. It is delivered by Vodafone, in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club, forming part of the Vodafone's ongoing commitment to supporting grassroots tennis in the UK and making the sport more accessible for players of all ages and abilities.

Emma Raducanu touches down in New York today to compete in a blockbuster new mixed doubles showcase at the U.S. Open that has drawn A-list talent - and fierce criticism.

The 2021 New York queen will join forces with Wimbledon runner-up Carlos Alcaraz in a star-studded partnership while Novak Djokovic teams up with Olga Danilovic.

Meanwhile, Venus Williams, now 45, will hunt the $1m top prize alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka as the boundary between sport and spectacle becomes increasingly blurred.

Wimbledon champions Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have signed up for the two-day extravaganza with just one traditional doubles duo - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - receiving a wildcard so far.

Two additional spots remain up for grabs. The event forms part of Fan Week next Tuesday and Wednesday - with U.S. Open singles action kicking off next Sunday (August 24) - as the season's final Grand Slam transforms into a three-week spectacle.



Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has slammed the new format as something that "makes a mockery of the event" and branded it "an exhibition, not a proper event."

However, previous celebrity mixed doubles alliances, including Andy Murray's partnership with Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, have captivated audiences and television viewers alike.

The Big Apple's battle of the sexes is now poised to become a yearly tradition. For Raducanu, it marks a comeback to the spotlight at Flushing Meadows following her inability to secure a singles victory in New York since 2021.

World No. 2 Alcaraz disclosed he made a "special request" to partner the British No. 1 and playfully suggested she would be "the boss". Raducanu displayed her playful side when discussing the prospect of facing Ben Shelton's blistering 150mph serve.

DON'T MISS

"I think I'm most scared to play certain shots," she laughed. "Ben Shelton's serve, that scares me. That's probably one in particular. And then obviously all the guys. It's very difficult to return their serves. Reilly Opelka? He's serving from a stepladder.

"It's incredible. But of course I'm very excited. It's such a unique opportunity, and I think a lot of the females will probably be feeling the same way. Returning the guys' serve is quite difficult."

However, not all the major stars will compete next week. World No. 2 Coco Gauff opted against participating in her home Grand Slam because the preparation week is "already packed". She explained: "I'm very competitive, if I were to lose, I would not be happy. So, I didn't want to waste mental energy on that."

Meanwhile, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka declared she was remaining "loyal" to Grigor Dimitrov and will not pursue another partner after the Bulgarian withdrew with a pectoral injury sustained at Wimbledon. Jack Draper has selected Jessica Pegula as his new partner following the withdrawals of both Qinwen Zheng and Paula Badosa.

Carlos Alcaraz has enjoyed a perfect return to tennis after his post-Wimbledon break, and will now face off against Jannik Sinner yet again, this time in the Cincinnati Open final.

It marks a rematch of their Wimbledon and Italian Open showdowns, both of which were for the title.

Nowadays, given their respective seedings, it feels like anytime they meet, it will be to contest the sport's greatest honours.

Whoever comes out on top will have given themselves the perfect preparation for the upcoming US Open, in what is the final chance to claim a major before the season starts to wind down.

And yet, even before Carlos Alcaraz had beaten Alexander Zverev in a semi-final marred by the latter's struggling fitness, he was told what both his best and weakest qualities were.

The person who offered this insight was Rick Macci, famed for being the formative coach of both Serena and Venus Williams before they went on to accomplish greatness.

His voice within the tennis community is a relentless one, and few can deny his credentials given the legendary figures he will forever be associated with.

Carlos best quality is he has every shot in the book and every match he will give it a look. His weakest quality is he has every shot in the book and sometimes lets you off the hook. @carlosalcaraz

Ironically, he named the same trait for both Alcaraz's best and worst qualities, suggesting that the never-ending bag of tricks makes him both dangerous, but also confused at times.

After all, it can be hard to decide when and where to use certain shots, knowing that they are all at his disposal.

Despite this critical claim from Macci, wrapped up in what feels oddly like a compliment, Alcaraz has quietly cruised into yet another Cincinnati Open final.

This time, he will have Jannik Sinner to deal with, having lost to Novak Djokovic last time out in what many still regard as one of the greatest best-of-three matches ever played.

In a match that lasted just shy of four hours, it was the Serbian who claimed his revenge after Alcaraz had dethroned him in the Wimbledon final just a month earlier.

Since that clash two years ago, the Spaniard's budding dominance has been met by Sinner, with the two establishing a duopoly at the apex of the men's game that seemingly no one can trouble.

The fact that they are set to meet again in yet another final, in the third straight event that both have entered, does little to dispel this notion.

Alas, it offers fans yet another iteration of this mouth-watering clash, which seems poised to be one of the best in the sport's history should they continue meeting in the final of some of the most elite competitions.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The ATP Winston-Salem is the famous last pit stop before the US Open, giving ATP players one more chance to accumulate minutes and confidence. There will be no shortage of entertaining matches on Day 1 of the tournament, and we here at LWOT have every match covered in our daily predictions, including Mackenzie McDonald vs Brandon Holt. Who will advance?

Head-to-head: first meeting

While Goffin may be past his peak, he's still capable of producing the odd deep run in a Tour-level tournament almost every season. The Belgian's durability appears to be his biggest hurdle these days, and Martinez will look to wear him down. The Spaniard produced some solid tennis in beating Nicolas Jarry in Cincinnati, but his lack of wins on hard courts means Goffin might have enough to take this.
Prediction: Goffin in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

It took Arthur Rinderknech three tries before he scored his first win in Winston-Salem last season. While Hamad Medjedovic has never played in this tournament before, he'll look to carry his momentum from Cincinnati, where he produced a spirited performance in a tight straight-sets defeat to Carlos Alcaraz. Rinderknech has steady hands, but it doesn't always feel like he dictates matches. Medjedovic can take the initiative, and he has the higher upside between them.
Prediction: Medjedovic in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

Bu won 40 matches on hard courts last year in a breakout season. He has a meagre six match wins on the same surface this year, although he has significantly cut down his participation in Challenger-level tournaments. Tseng's struggles are also evident with five wins from 12 matches on hard courts. Bu is the reliable player who can physically overmatch and overpower Tseng on a quick court.
Prediction: Bu in 2

 

Head-to-head: Carreno Busta 1-0 Nishioka

This is a tricky one to pick a winner given where both players are at right now, but Carreno Busta has a tremendous track record in Winston-Salem. He's a former champion and even during an injury-hit 2024 season, he stormed to the semifinals before retiring against Alex Michelsen. Nishioka has an equally messy injury record and has six documented retirements this season. Their tennis demands a lot out of them physically. The first set is crucial as it could dictate the outcome, and Carreno Busta's record in this tournament gives him a significant edge.
Prediction: Carreno Busta in 2

Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his seventh consecutive tour-level final by beating an ailing Alexander Zverev on Saturday at the Cincinnati Open. The 6-4, 6-3 victory set up a final showdown with Jannik Sinner, a rematch of the Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon title matches this season.

A high-quality opening set was decided by a late burst of Alcaraz brilliance, before the sweat-drenched Zverev began to struggle physically in the second. The German, who was treated by the physio in his dominant quarter-final win against Ben Shelton on Friday, left the court for a medical timeout at 2-1 in the second and was clearly compromised the rest of the match.

"It's never easy playing against someone that you know is not feeling 100 per cent. It's even tougher when it comes from Sascha, such a great player, such a great person off the court. We have a really good relationship," Alcaraz said after levelling the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 6-6.

"We started the match really good, playing good rallies, a good level of tennis," added the Spaniard, who escaped 0/40 at 1-2 in the opening set. "But then all of a sudden he started to feel bad. And then my focus, I was thinking about how he's feeling, besides focusing on myself and playing good tennis. It was a really difficult situation for me and I just wish him all the best."

The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings attacked the Zverev forehand from the start, hitting high and heavy cross-court balls off his own forehand wing to target that corner. Conversely, Zverev found success by taking his forehand down the line at every opportunity to avoid Alcaraz's preferred pattern.

From 2-3 in the opening set, Alcaraz found a new gear with inspired shotmaking to take the first set and break to open the second. The Spaniard gifted the break back by hitting three consecutive double faults in the next game, but a hampered Zverev was not able to challenge beyond that.

The straightforward manner of the semi-final victory was in stark contrast to Alcaraz's quarter-final against Rublev, which he won 7-5 in the third set. He also lost the second set to Damir Dzumhur in his opening round.



Through to his ninth ATP Masters 1000 final (7-1) and first on hard courts since he claimed the Indian Wells crown last year, Alcaraz extended his winning streak to 16 matches at that prestigious level on the heels of his title runs in Monte-Carlo and Rome. He is 38-2 overall since the start of April, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

At 22 years and three months, Alcaraz is the third-youngest player to reach nine Masters 1000 finals after Rafael Nadal (20) and Novak Djokovic (21).

After playing his 12th Lexus ATP Head2Head match against Zverev — their first meeting this year after four in 2024 — Alcaraz will next meet Sinner for the fourth time this year and 14th time overall.

"I'm really looking forward to playing against him once again," said the Spaniard, who fell in four sets to his rival in their most recent meeting at Wimbledon. "We raise our level to the top and we bring a really beautiful tennis to the match. I'm ready to take the challenge. I'm ready to see the things that I did wrong in the last match and trying to be better on that side on Monday."

MASON, OH − The matchup most tennis fans wanted is here. 

The Cincinnati Open men's finals on Monday, Aug. 18 will be between the top 2 players in the world when Jannik Sinner meets Carlos Alcaraz on Center Court of the Lindner Family Tennis Center. 

In what has become the rivalry of a new generation of tennis phenoms, Alcaraz and Sinner's last four meetings were all in a tournament final. Last month, Sinner snapped a five-match losing streak to Alcaraz to become the first-ever Italian to win the Wimbledon men's singles title. 

It will be the fourth meeting this year between the two rivals after Alcaraz triumphed on clay at Roland Garros and Rome. 

The last time the ATP No. 1 and No. 2 met in the Cincinnati Open finals, it resulted in the longest (3 hours, 49 minutes) and arguably the best match in tournament history when Novak Djokovic beat Alcaraz in 2023. 

Overall, Alcaraz is 8-5 all-time against Sinner, including a 4-2 record on outdoor hard court. 

“I'm just really happy to be building such a great rivalry against Jannik (Sinner),” Alcaraz said in his pre-tournament press conference. “I think we've done great things in tennis in such a short period of time.” 

Here's how the ATP's top players advanced to the Cincinnati Open finals. 

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner will get a chance to defend his Rookwood Cup title.

In the Cincinnati Open semifinals Aug. 16, the ATP's top player defeated World No. 136 Terence Atmane on Center Court, 7-6 (4), 6-2.

On his 24th birthday, Sinner extended his hard-court winning streak to 26 consecutive matches and picked up his 200th tour-level win on the concreate (200-49).

"My mindset today was in a good spot," Sinner said after having Aug. 15 off. "For my side, I'm very happy to be in a final again."

Sinner, the reigning Cincinnati Open champion, will attempt to become the first back-to-back men's singles winner since Roger Federer (2014-2015).

Sinner's dominance was enough to end the Cincinnati Cinderella run of Atmane, who began the tournament as a qualifier. Atmane won seven matches in a nine-day stretch, including back-to-back upsets of ATP Top 10 seeds in No. 4 Taylor Frtiz and No. 9 Holger Rune.

"He (Atmane) has beaten incredible players throughout his (run) to the semifinals, so I knew I had to be very, very careful," Sinner said. "He has huge, huge potential and I think we saw that throughout the tournament. I wish him all of the best."

Atmane arrived in Mason with just five tour-level victories. He'll leave with 10, has doubled his year-to-date prize money and will crack the ATP Top 100 for the first time in his career.

Atmane was the first qualifier to reach the Cincinnati Open semifinals since 2015.

Atmane didn't go down without a fight against the World No. 1. The left-handed Frenchman landed 78% of his serves in the first set, notching six aces, to force a tiebreak, where Sinner would ultimately prevail.

Sinner took full advantage of the match with his first break in the fourth game of the second set to take a 3-1 advantage.

ATP No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz has a chance at redemption. 

Two years ago, Alcaraz was the No. 1 player in the world when he fell to Novak Djokovic in a marathon, three-set thriller on Center Court. 

After an upset Round of 32 loss last summer, Alcaraz is back in the Cincinnati Open finals for the second time after knocking out 2021 tournament champ and ATP No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev, 6-4, 6-3.

While Sinner has stayed at the ATP's summit for 61 weeks, Alcaraz has put together a storybook 2025 campaign with a tour-best 53 wins and five titles. He's now reached the final in seven consecutive tournaments after a second-round loss in Miami. 

Alcaraz, who entered 5-6 all-time against Zverev, got a key break in the first game to take a 4-3 lead, then held serve the rest of the way to win the first set. 

Despite Zverev landing 78% of his first serves and Alcaraz playing with more unforced errors (13 to 8), the Spaniard grabbed momentum and didn't let it go, capturing a tone-setting break to open the second set. 

Zverev, who battled illness in a win over Ben Shelton Aug. 15, needed medical attention during the second set after fighting back with a break to take a 2-1 lead. 

The two held serve until 3-3, when Alcaraz turned the match with another break at 4-3 and polished off the victory shortly after over Zverev, who struggled mightily to move efficiently after the medical timeout. 

"It was difficult. I think we started really well with good rallies and a good level of tennis. Then, all of a sudden, he started to feel bad," Alcaraz said. "My focus was thinking about how he was feeling. It was a difficult situation for me and I just wish him all the best."

Alcaraz has now won 16 consecutive matches at ATP Masters 1000 events and is 38-2 overall since the beginning of April. 

When he lines up against Sinner Aug. 18, it will be Alcaraz's 29 tour-level final and ninth at the ATP Masters 1000 level, with his lone loss coming against Djokovic in Cincinnati two years ago. 

"I'm really looking forward to playing him (Sinner) once again," Alcaraz said. "For the people, I think it's great watching our matches because we raise our level to the top and we bring really beautiful tennis. I'm ready to take the challenge."

On the promising and worrying parts of Alcaraz's semifinal performance, where he admitted, “I started thinking about how he's feeling, instead of focusing on myself."BySteve TignorPublished Aug 17, 2025 copy_link

MASON, OH—“It's never easy playing against someone you know is not 100 percent,” Carlos Alcaraz said after his 6-4, 6-3 win over Alexander Zverev in the semifinals here on Saturday night.After seeing what happened to the Spaniard early in the second set, those words may sound like something of an understatement.With Alcaraz up a set and serving at 1-0 in the second, Zverev stopped moving for anything that was more than a step away from him. He let one ground stroke go by, and waved at a serve while holding his racquet in his left hand. Alcaraz was up 40-15, and the air had gone out of the arena, as Zverev looked ready to wave the white flag.

He let one ground stroke go by, and waved at a serve while holding his racquet in his left hand. Alcaraz was up 40-15, and the air had gone out of the arena, as Zverev looked ready to wave the white flag.

Somehow, Alcaraz found a way to keep Zverev in it for longer than seemed possible, or healthy for the German. Alcaraz double faulted four times in that game alone, and sent a forehand long at break point. Zverev was alive, and a few minutes later Alcaraz was letting out a scream of disbelief.“All of a sudden he started feeling really bad,” Alcaraz said. “And then my focus, I started thinking about how he's feeling, besides focusing on myself and playing good tennis.”All's well that ends well, of course, for Alcaraz. In this case, all's well that starts well, too. The first set was a good one from both guys, with sharp, all-court rallies and a mix of power and touch. Most promising for Alcaraz was the way he dug himself out of a 0-40 hold at 2-3, and then turned around and broke serve at 3-3. He saved two of those break points with deft forehand drop shots, and broke Zverev by sticking a crosscourt backhand volley a foot from the sideline. From there, Alcaraz's serve started to click, and he finished with 11 aces in nine service games.

“We started the match really good, good rallies, good level of tennis,” Alcaraz said, lamenting the fact that it didn't stay that way.While Zverev made the semifinal at a Masters 1000 this week, his physical state is concerning going into the US Open. This was the second straight night where he struggled to breathe and move, sweated much more than is normal for him, and was forced to call the doctor onto the court. It has been hot and humid in Cincinnati, but he played both of those matches in the evening, when the worst of the weather had past.If Zverev is already thinking of New York, Alcaraz has one more piece of business to attend to in Cincinnati. A pretty big piece of business, in fact: Another final with Jannik Sinner, their fourth of 2025.

What can he take from Saturday's semi into Monday's finale? On the plus side, he can be hopeful about his serve, and how much it can help him on these fast courts. On the minus side, he showed signs against Zverev that a second-set letdown was coming, something that had already happened to him twice here. Who knows how the set would have played out if Zverev had been healthy.But all of that is in the past, and now Alcaraz and Sinner can ascend into their private stratosphere, with the sports world as happy spectators again. Alcaraz, who is coming off a loss to Sinner at Wimbledon last month, sounds like he's not going to settle for anything less than his best this time around.“We really bring out beautiful tennis,” Alcaraz said of their Top 2 rivalry. “I'm ready for the challenge. Just to be ready and perfect.”

Jannik Sinner ended the dream run of World No. 136 Terence Atmane on Saturday at the Cincinnati Open, but not before navigating a tricky first-set test from the French lefty.

Celebrating his 24th birthday in style, defending champion Sinner delivered a rock-solid display to triumph 7-6(4), 6-2 and reach his eighth ATP Masters 1000 final. With his 86-minute victory, during which he did not face a break point, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings recorded his 200th tour-level win on hard courts and extended his win streak on the surface to 26 matches.

Into his 28th tour-level final, Sinner awaits fierce rival Carlos Alcaraz or World No. 3 Alexander Zverev. The Italian trails first-placed Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, with both players battling it out in a thrilling contest for Year-End ATP No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Sinner will aim to defend his Cincinnati title and close the more than 1,000 point lead that Alcaraz owns in the Race.

Now a two-time Cincinnati finalist and a fan favourite in Ohio, Sinner was serenaded with 'Happy Birthday' by the adoring crowd after the match.

“It was a very, very tough challenge,” said Sinner. “Every time you play against something completely new, it's difficult, but playing against this guy in the later stages of a tournament is even more difficult. The pressure is higher and you know they deserve to be there… He has beaten incredible players throughout his wins.

“I knew that I had to be very careful, and my mindset was in a good spot. I felt like I handled the situations on the court very well. He was serving incredibly well in the first set. He has huge, huge potential, and I think we saw that in the tournament.”

After coming through qualifying and earning consecutive Top-10 wins against Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune en route to his first ATP Tour semi-final, Atmane imposed himself on the occasion with a supreme serving display in the opening stages, including dropping three consecutive aces on Sinner in the seventh game.

Yet the Frenchman undid his hard work by hitting his first double fault of the match to open the tie-break, which proved to be the difference-maker in an evenly contested first set.



While Sinner's own serving performance in the opener was admirable — he dropped just one of 21 points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats — there were concerning signs at the start of the second. Yet after a lengthy opening hold, which featured four Deuces, Sinner quickly brushed aside any doubts and began to make significant ground in Atmane's service games.

Moments before the players walked out onto Centre Court for their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, Atmane lightened the mood by surprising Sinner with a gift in the tunnel. The Frenchman, a fond fan of the Japanese trading card game Pokemon, gave the World No. 1 a card from his collection before they embraced and headed into battle.

Despite defeat, Atmane can reflect on a milestone week in Cincinnati, where he has surged 67 spots to a new career-high No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 23-year-old is next scheduled to compete in the qualifying event for the US Open, which begins Monday.

Terence Stamp has died. Known for bringing erudite stateliness and dignity to Superman's General Zod, Stamp's decades-long film career contains far more than comic book villainy. With his piercing stare and ridiculously well-defined cheekbones, Stamp brought a palpable intensity to the screen. Amid his time as London's “It” boy of the Swinging Sixties, he worked with cinema's most revered actors and directors. He also lived on an ashram, published memoirs, and wrote cookbooks for wheat-, dairy-, salt-, and sugar-free diets. Per Reuters, his family confirmed his death Sunday morning. He was 87.

“He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come,” the family said in a statement. “We ask for privacy at this sad time.”

Born in London's East End in 1938, Stamp grew up poor during the Blitz, with his father, a tugboat stoker, heading to war. In between shifts as a barmaid, his mother raised Stamp and his four siblings through the London bombings. She also introduced him to acting by taking a 4-year-old Stamp to see Gary Cooper in Beau Geste. He immediately knew he wanted to be an actor. “Who better to mold your life on?” Stamp later said. After working in advertising for several years, Stamp won a scholarship to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where he became roommates with Michael Caine, Stamp's one-time mentor. He made his screen debut in Peter Ustinov's adaptation of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, which earned him an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe. The role catapulted him to stardom, as did his dating life. Stamp became one of the era's most photographed stars while dating Julie Christie and supermodel Jean Shrimpton. He was even considered to succeed Sean Connery as James Bond. Unfortunately, his ideas “put the frighteners” on producers. “I didn't get a second call.”

The '60s saw Stamp reach remarkable creative heights, working opposite cinema's most revered names, including Laurence Olivier and Ken Loach. In William Wyler's The Collector, Stamp played his first unsettlingly calm villain, an archetype he'd return to with masterful variation throughout his career. He traveled to Italy to act for Federico Fellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Still, he learned his greatest lessons working for directors “who don't really like me and never really wanted me.”

“John Schlesinger, when I did Far From The Maddening Crowd, made it very clear that I wasn't his first choice. I was foisted on him by the producer,” Stamp told BFI. “For the first time, I had to work without the cooperation of a director. I discovered a lot about myself. I discovered that, left to my own devices, I could pull something out of the bag.”

After his public breakup with Jean Shrimpton, Stamp moved to India to live in an ashram. He returned broke and landed the most popular role of his career, demanding Earthlings “knee before Zod” as General Zod in Superman and Superman II. Working opposite one of his heroes, Marlon Brando, Stamp brought the ashram's teachings to the set. “I'll play this role as though I'm in the ashram,” he said. “I won't worry about being evil or what I say or what I do. I'll bring this kind of all-enveloping presence to it.” The result was a high-water mark for the genre.



Stamp built upon his Superman success with a diversity of roles. He starred as a transgender woman traveling the Australian outback with two drag queens in The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. It was a groundbreaking role. “My characterization was based on how it would feel to be born into the wrong body,” he told The A.V. Club in 2013. “My feeling was, this was always a woman, she'd always only been a woman. But the truth is, the more I became familiar with the movie, I realized that it kind of is a masterpiece, really. It's so silly that people don't take it seriously, and it's kind of a perfect movie. Flawless.”

Five years later, he played Steven Soderbergh's seething career criminal on the hunt in The Limey. In addition to Limey, he was a fixture of the 1999 box office, appearing in Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace and Bowfinger. During this time, he met his first and only wife, Elizabeth O'Rourke, who was 33 years his junior. The couple published two cookbooks, based on his various dietary allergies, and divorced in 2008.

Stamp continued working throughout the 2000s. He returned to Kypton, playing Jor-El on Smallville, and appeared in Tim Burton's Big Eyes. His career remained varied, starring in the 2019 Adam Sandler comedy, Murder Mystery, and HBO's His Dark Materials. Appropriately, he returned to Mod London for 2021's Last Night In Soho, playing the type of brooding baddie that made him a star.

Contrary to popular belief, longtime HGTV stars Erin and Ben Napier can't actually save the world — despite many of their fans hoping they will. 

The couple's list of talents and achievements seems never-ending, from inspiring small town transformations across North America to launching a movement to raise children without access to social media. But on August 16, 2025, Erin inadvertently ruffled some feathers with an “inconsequential” Instagram post about her and Ben's date night.

Noting that they had “had dinner and a good state of the union,” Erin received lots of pushback from followers who thought she meant they'd been happily discussing how America is doing, rather than the state of their union as a couple — a popular strategy developed by The Gottman Institute for married couples to discuss their relationship weekly. 

Erin told one fan that anyone who misunderstood her post should “unfollow me immediately.” And when another fan insinuated that Erin and Ben were not doing enough to influence positive change in the United States, Erin was quick to respond with a hilarious bit of sass, sarcastically vowing to go “fix everything.”

A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)

Erin posted a photo on August 16 of Ben on their date night, looking relaxed in a floral shirt at an outdoor dining spot, and she wrote, “grandparents had the girls so we had dinner and a good state of the union. and a little sunburn. also, can non strategic and inconsequential instagram posts make a comeback?”

“Not while your countries on fire,” responded one follower in a since-deleted comment reviewed by EntertainmentNow. “Sticking your head in the sand isn't going to make it go away and Southerners need to take their share of responsibility for this mess.” 

Within minutes, Erin replied to that follower — who signed the comment from a “concerned” Canadian, including the Canadian flag emoji — with a sarcastic quip that's also since been deleted. 

Erin wrote, “yeah you're so right. ben and i will fix everything, brb”

Although Erin had been trying to inspire others to share “inconsequential” posts about everyday life, her August 16 post appeared highly consequential to some of her 1.5 million Instagram followers who assumed her “state of the union” comment was politically motivated. Erin not only denied this in her comment section, but urged those who misunderstood her to unfollow her. 

On August 17, one fan wrote, “My hope is you worded your post this way so unhinged people would comment 😂 …. Lovely couple!!! ❤️”

Erin, who has since limited her comments on the post, replied, “anyone who thinks this post has a thing to do with politics needs to unfollow me immediately 😄 seriously though.”

Among the people who were confused by or unhappy with Erin's post, one commented, “Stop… a good state of the union?????”

Another wrote, “when you are white and not an immigrant or a person of color you get to have the privilege of inconsequential posts.”

Someone else chimed in, “Not under the current regime. That life style is now gone for those of us who care about democracy and freedom”

A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)

Not everyone was upset or confused by Erin's post. It received over 48,000 likes within 24 hours and her comment section had plenty of supportive comments from fans who agreed with her wish for more posts about everyday life. 

“I'd love it if IG went back to ‘here's a piece of my day' type posts,” one fan wrote. “Enjoy, and thanks for sharing :)”

Someone else commented, “Just 😍 the beauty of every day life. Sometimes it's okay just to breathe and appreciate your life too 💞”

Another fan chimed in, “Yes and yes!!! Puppies and casual date nights and “uncurated” life please! Back to when social media was fun…end “doom scrolling” one inconsequential post at a time!”

	Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows food prices have spiked by 2.9 percent since last July, and wholesale prices on fresh and dry vegetables increased by nearly 40 percent last month — the biggest increase in the last three years. And rising prices are likely to continue. Why? Donald Trump‘s tariffs.


	Producers are already seeing rising costs. The Labor Department's producer price index, a measure of inflation on wholesale goods and producer costs, increased by nearly one percentage point from June to July. Wholesale prices are up by 3.3 percent over last July. These numbers were significantly higher than economists predicted.


	The data “points to pipeline inflation that's likely to spill into consumer prices in the months ahead,” Michelle Green, a former Labor Department economist currently working at corporate planning firm Board, told Axios.


	According to the Consumer Price Index, prices for consumers have already risen on several foods. Prices have increased by 5.8 percent on meat, 3.1 percent on poultry, 16.4 percent on eggs, and 14.5 percent on coffee.

	“Keep in mind, certain foods like coffee, cocoa that's used in chocolate, we can't grow these here, so we're going to be faced with higher prices or changing what we drink,” food trends expert Phil Lempert told WPTV West Palm Beach.


	Prices will likely increase on other foods as well. While for now, it seems some companies are eating the cost of tariffs, they won't be able to hold off forever on pushing those rising costs to consumers.

	











	“It will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at financial markets research firm fwdbonds told PBS.


	These rising prices will not just be limited to foods. Home electronic prices, for example, rose 5 percent in July as compared to June. Core consumer prices overall increased from 2.9 percent in June to 3.1 percent in July, far above the Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent.

	Trump has also fired the head of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the Consumer Price Index because he didn't like the July jobs numbers, potentially putting into question future reports by the bureau.


	As wholesale and consumer prices have risen, so has the demand on food banks, which were already hit hard with shortages due to federal budget cuts earlier this year and actions at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” congressional Republicans passed last month also cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by $186 billion, meaning more people may be turning to increasingly strapped food banks to make up for the loss in food assistance.

	Although The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is coming to an unceremonious end, Conan O'Brien is confident its host isn't going anywhere.


	While speaking Saturday at his induction into the Television Academy Hall of Fame, the 5x Emmy-winning comedian praised Colbert as “too talented and too essential” and shared his thoughts on the future of late-night television.


	“Yes, late-night television as we have known it since around 1950 is going to disappear. But those voices are not going anywhere,” said O'Brien. “People like Stephen Colbert are too talented and too essential to go away. It's not gonna happen.”

	Meanwhile, Paramount is under fire for canceling The Late Show on the heels of the company's $16M settlement with Trump, which has been scrutinized as potential bribery by some lawmakers. Following Colbert's ongoing jokes at the president's expense, Trump has celebrated the talk show's demise.


	George Cheeks, CBS‘s Chair of TV Media, has since claimed that the talk show's “economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.” Jeff Shell, president of Paramount under its new Skydance acquisition, has shown his support for the decision, explaining, “Late-night has a huge problem right now. … You can't make it work economically anymore.”


	Going scorched-earth on CBS ahead of his May 2026 departure, Colbert recently kicked off the job search while signing off for summer hiatus from The Late Show. “Netflix, call me I'm available in June,” he said last weekend on the show. “I will also entertain offers from Amazon.”

	Three years after its six-season run ended, Bob Odenkirk doesn't expect Better Call Saul to escape from behind bars anytime soon.


	Although he didn't sound optimistic about a revival of the Breaking Bad spin-off, which ran for six seasons on AMC from 2015 to '22, Odenkirk said “of course I would” reprise his role as the titular scam artist/lawyer Saul Goodman.


	“That part turned my life around, and I've given more to that part than anything I've done,” he said on Today. “Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. They are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV. So if they were to think of something in that world, of course I would do it.”

	Odenkirk added of the possibility, “But I don't think so. I think they've all moved on to some more amazing projects that you'll soon see.”


	In the Aug. 15, 2022 series finale ‘Saul Gone', Saul takes responsibility for years of his criminal activity, including his work with Walter White, resulting in an 86-year prison sentence.


	“He's not getting out [of prison]. If there's another Saul show, it takes place inside prison,” added Odenkirk of a potential revival.


	After Breaking Bad‘s five-season run from 2008 to 2013, Better Call Saul followed Saul Goodman six years before he got tangled up in Walter White's criminal enterprise. The show was nominated for multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Awards.

I'd give anything to see a BCS spinoff featuring Rhea Seehorn as Kim. She obviously walked away from Jimmy but her life would be a compelling narrative. Only if handled by the same writers and show runners as BCS of course!

Oscar nominee, character actor extraordinaire, and one of the most multi-faceted actors of his generation, the British star Terence Stamp died on Sunday at the age of 87. The news was first reported by the New York Times, which shared that the actor's family had “confirmed his death but did not specify where he died or the cause.”

Born in July 22, 1938, in London, one of five children of Thomas Stamp and Ethel (Perrott) Stamp, the idea of growing up to become a movie star could not have been further from Stamp's mind or early experience. Initially, young Stamp worked in advertising, but he had long harbored dreams of acting, and trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

His first major role in “Billy Budd” earned him his first and only Oscar nomination, but it also set his career on fire. Early success, including acclaim for his piercing blue eyes and iconic voice, notched him work with everyone from Federico Fellini to Marlon Brando, but his career seemingly fell off as he approached his thirties. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






His casting as General Zod in the first two “Superman” films of the '70s has long been viewed as his great comeback, but over the following decades, he continued to make compelling, often off-beat choices. Those included starring in “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” as a transgender woman with unexpected tenderness and bringing his unique zeal to Steven Soderbergh's “The Limey.” Always wonderful, always unpredictable. 

In 2013, the actor reflected on the ups and downs of his career with IndieWire. At the time, he was returning to the big screen with a lead role in “Unfinished Song.” “I've just grown used to doing roles that are tough guys, and it hasn't really made any difference to my life,” he said. “I guess in the big trajectory of things, I was out of work for most of the ‘70s and I just traveled. I got to the point where I just thought I was never going to get the call. But I did.”

Stamp looked back on the career- and life-changing calls behind his work in the “Superman” films, telling IndieWire, “I got recalled to do the first two ‘Superman' movies, that I think are the very best of all those comic book movies. But during that leave of absence, I guess I changed, like emotionally, I was changed from a leading man to a character actor. In a way it was very painful at the time, but it's proven to be a blessing in disguise. The reason that I've had such a long career is because I'm up for anything. I'm sort of fearless at this point in my life. So even when I did General Zod, can you really imagine Robert Redford or Warren Beatty playing General Zod? I was of a similar ilk.”

 










He continued, “Initially I never really understood why I couldn't get a lead part after '69. My own understanding of it was that I was so identified with the ‘60s period, that when it ended, the word on the street was, ‘Well, we're looking for a young Terence Stamp,' and I was in my thirties. The fundamental change was in Terence. So by the time Zod came up, I was really hungry to work. I guess that's why it became such a landmark role for me. There was nearly eight years of storing up energy being ready to let loose on the set of the ‘Superman' movies.”

He was nominated for two BAFTAs, two Golden Globes, and won Cannes' Best Actor award in 1965 for his work in William Wyler's “The Collector.” He last appeared on-screen in 2021, care of a small but notable role in Edgar Wright's “Last Night in Soho.”

The NYT notes that in “2002, at age 64, he married Elizabeth O'Rourke, a 29-year-old Australian pharmacist; they divorced in 2008.” The NYT reported that “information on survivors was not immediately available.”

	Scottish filmmaker Kevin Macdonald shared an intriguing behind-the-scenes anecdote about the production of his 2009 fiction feature State Of Play this afternoon at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where he gave a keynote Q&A session alongside his brother, producer Andrew Macdonald. 


	In the session, chaired by Edinburgh TV Festival head Rowan Woods, Kevin was asked about his filmmaking forays in Hollywood, when he zeroed in on State of Play. 


	“I didn't realize at the time, but looking back, that was a pivotal film in Hollywood, as well as for me, because it was sort of the end [of an era],” Kevin said of the film, which starred an A-list cast including Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck.

	“Donna Langley mentioned it too when she did Desert Island Discs. It was a turning point movie for her at Universal and the rest of Hollywood because it was conceived as an all-star, intelligent thriller for adults at $100 million. Can you imagine that today?” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Kevin continued to say that the film was originally seen by its studio, Universal, as a star vehicle for Brad Pitt, and he was tasked with tightening up the film's screenplay and went looking for a writer to collaborate with to complete the job. 


	“I got Tony Gilroy, who was very hot off the back of doing the Bourne films and many other great films,” Kevin said. “We spent two months in his apartment, rewriting the script, spending untold amounts of money, and then showed it to Brad Pitt, and he hated it.” 


	Kevin added, “That was just the beginning of a long and very Hollywood-y saga, which I'm glad I had. It was the tail end of a certain kind of wasteful Hollywood filmmaking.” 


	Pitt was later replaced by Crowe. The film's starry ensemble also features Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright, Jason Bateman, Jeff Daniels, and Helen Mirren. The film tells the story of Cal McAffrey, a fictional journalist, and his probe into the suspicious death of the assistant and mistress of a Congressman. 

	











	Kevin added that the entire film was shot on a sound stage in Hollywood. 


	“We knocked down the wall between two huge sound stages,” he said. “We had to build a big enough set for an office, even though we could have just gone to Washington, D.C.. But because Brad had a young family at the time and didn't want to travel, we built this set that in the end he didn't end up being able to use.”


	This afternoon's session between Kevin and Andrew was the centerpiece of this year's Industry section at Edinburgh. Andrew is the Chair of the festival, and before the session, the pair screened one of their early shorts, which was shot on site at Edinburgh in the early 90s. 


	The short features the brothers attempting to sell the screenplay for Shallow Grave to a producer. They are unsuccessful in raising funds for the film, but Andrew explained that the short helped to launch their careers. 


	“It screened on the last day of the festival in '92,” he said. “From that, we met this amazing woman who was the commissioning editor at Scottish television called Maxine Baker, and she then commissioned us to make a series called Shadowing.”


	He later added: “And when we were making this TV show Shadowing in Edinburgh, we got the script [for Shallow Grave] to somebody at Channel Four.”


Shallow Grave was eventually directed by Danny Boyle, marking his first collaboration with Andrew. The pair went on to make Trainspotting and several other features, including The Beach.


	This year's Edinburgh Film Festival ends on August 20.

Disney's 'Freakier Friday' also beat the $9.3 million domestic opening of Bob Odenkirk's action-comedy 'Nobody' sequel with a second-weekend haul of $14.5 million. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Bob Odenkirk's modestly budgeted sequel Nobody 2 is having to settle for a third-place finish in its domestic box office debut as Zach Cregger's Weapons continues to fire on all cylinders and stay atop the chart in its sophomore outing, followed by Disney's family comedy Freakier Friday.


Nobody 2, about a seemingly average suburban dad who leads a double life as a stealth operative, is on course to open on the lower end of expectations with $9.3 million from 3,260 locations after receiving a B+ CinemaScore from audiences (its audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes is more promising at 89 percent). Its early global total is $14.2 million.

	The first Nobody opened amid the pandemic to $6.8 million on its way to grossing a pleasing $68 million domestically. The sequel cost a modest $25 million to make before marketing, so no one at Universal is losing sleep, since it is sure to make up ground when hitting premium VOD as early as three weeks from now (the studio has perfected the art of PVOD).

	From New Line and Warner Bros., Weapons had no trouble staying atop the chart in its sophomore outing with an estimated $25 million from 3,450 locations — a scant decline of 43 percent. That's a rare feat for a horror film, and cements the movie's status as a water-cooler sensation. Overseas, it dropped 33 percent to $18.4 million for an early worldwide total of $148.8 million in yet another win for Warners, which paid $38 million for rights to the project.

	











	The female-skewing Freakier Friday, reteaming Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, is likewise grinning in its sophomore outing with an estimated haul $14.5 million from 3,975 cinemas for a worldwide cume of $86.3 million against a budget under $45 million. The body-swap comedy fell 50 percent domestically. 


Nobody 2 isn't the weekend's only new player, but it is by far doing the best of the bunch.


	Spike Lee's prestige pic Highest 2 Lowest, which reunites him for the first time in 18 years with Denzel Washington, is opening in select theaters before debuting relatively quickly on Apple TV+ in early September. While Apple is making a major push into theatrical — F1: The Movie is one of the summer's biggest blockbusters and is getting a traditional release in cinemas — Highest 2 Lowest doesn't appear to be part of that strategy.


	A24, which partnered with Apple on Lee's latest movie, isn't making grosses public so far, but those with visibility into numbers being reported by some theaters suggest Highest 2 Lowest is doing tepid business for a movie with such a high-profile director and cast, who gathered together for a splashy world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May.


	The Lionsgate-distributed Americana — starring Sydney Sweeney opposite Paul Walter Hauser and Halsey — is bombing in its nationwide debut in 1,123 theaters. The pic opened to an estimated $500,000 for a sixteenth-place finish. The crime-heist movie, which has been well received by critics, has taken more than two years to arrive on the big screen after first premiering at SXSW in 2023. Lionsgate insists the film is part of a multi-platform strategy, including premium VOD, and that its box office performance is in no way a disappointment, financial or otherwise.

	











Americana opens in the wake of a media firestorm engulfing Sweeney after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. Almost overnight, some TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” They claimed the comments promote eugenics since Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. While countless users dismissed such theories as utter nonsense, the debate went viral. Even President Donald Trump weighed in after The Guardian reported that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida prior to the 2024 election.


More to come.

	Ronnie Rondell Jr., the longtime Hollywood stuntman immortalized on fire for the cover of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, has died at the age of 88.


	Rondell Jr. died Tuesday at a senior living facility in Missouri, his family announced (via The Hollywood Reporter). No cause of death was provided.


	A stuntman and actor with over 200 credits on his filmography, Rondell Jr. is perhaps best known for a single photograph: The iconic cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here, where he was lit on fire on a Hollywood backlot (Warner Bros. Studios), shaking hands with a man in a suit (Danny Rogers).


	“I'd been doing a lot of fire work in those days, and I had the special suits and all this stuff for fully enveloped fire,” Rondell Jr. said in the documentary Pink Floyd: The Story of Wish You Were Here. “It was pretty easy to do, not too life-threatening, and paid well.”


	To capture the photo, conceived by Hipgnosis' Storm Thorgesen and Audrey Powell, Rondell Jr. was reportedly lit on fire 15 times, as wind and other factors — “There's a funny thing about fire. When it gets in your face, you're going to move,” Rondell Jr. added — forced the many attempts.

	











	During the shoot, the flames caused Rondell Jr. to lose an eyebrow and part of his mustache, but the finished product was worth it: Wish You Were Here is routinely hailed as one of the greatest album covers of all time.

	“Ronnie was very gracious about it considering… but as far as he was concerned as a professional in the movie industry it was all in a day's work,” Powell said of Rondell Jr.s contribution.

	











	In a big screen and small screen career that spanned from 1955 to 2003, Rondell Jr. appeared significantly-albeit-anonymously or served as a stunt coordinator in films and shows like Lethal Weapon, Batman & Robin, Twister, The Crow, Predator 2, They Live, The Karate Kid, Commando, and TV's Charlie's Angels. While he retired in 2000, he returned for one final film, a chase sequence in 2003's The Matrix Reloaded, where his son R.A. Rondell served as supervising stunt coordinator.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU: After Saturday post… Summer is now in its August sleep with the overall weekend for all titles falling under $100M for the second time this season with an estimated $93M per ComScore. The last time this happened in 2025 was during the second weekend of summer, May 9-11, when all movies grossed just over $84M per Box Office Mojo. While summer at $3.4 billion remains ahead of last year's heat wave by +2%, as we mentioned last weekend, we're unlikely to hit $4 billion mark. The last time summer did that, was pre-Covid.  


	As we said earlier this week, thank God Warner Bros moved Weapons into the late summer, or else we wouldn't be feeling a pulse. The Zach Cregger pic's hold for weekend 2 stands at -43% for a second frame of $25M after a $7.4M Friday and Saturday of $9.6M, +29%. 

	











	While Weapons isn't having the dips of Get Out (-15%) and Sinners (-5%) in its second weekend, any time a horror movie is holding better than -50%, that's remarkable, and this original horror movie is posting a second weekend that's better than 2025's other big horror pics, Final Destination: Bloodlines (-63%) and 28 Years Later (-68%). Weapons has PLF and Imax, the latter grossing $1.8M stateside for a $10.5M running cume in weekend 2. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Global for Weapons, which only cost New Line $38M+, stands at $148.8M.


	Disney's Freakier Friday looks to come in with a second weekend at $14.5M, -49%.


	Universal's Bob Odenkirk uber-violent action sequel Nobody 2 despite solid exits of a B+ CinemaScore (the first one received an A-) and 4 stars and a 62% definite recommend on Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, is coming in softer than expected with a $9.25M opening after a $3.8M Friday and Saturday of $3.1M. The movie was cheap at net $25M before P&A spend, and clearly this is a Lionsgate model meat and potato action movie aimed at older dudes (the overall 45+ set who showed up at 40%). In fact, Lionsgate's winter action movies did better with Den of Thieves 2 at $15M and Flight Risk at $11.5M. However, what's unfortunate here is that the audience (at least from a dollar-wise perspective) for Nobody 2 didn't expand that much from the original's opening, which posted $6.8M. With moviegoers skittish about returning to cinemas after Covid when the first title opened in 2021, the following for this IP has only grown so much. No John Wick phenomenon going on here with this 87North production. The original John Wick, similar to the first Austin Powers, boomed on home entertainment fueling bigger theatrical openings and grosses for its part 2. It's unfortunate for Nobody as these movies are a great homage to Steve McQueen titles like The Hunter and Clint Eastwood movies such as Every Which Way But Loose. Nobody 2 has PLFs which are driving 29% of the weekend with an even play across the country, however, prominent in the West. AMC Burbank 16 is the single leading venue with just over $28K through Saturday night. Diversity demos for the overall 68% male leaning movie were 52% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic and Latino, 12% Black and 8% Asian American.

	











	Clearly, the fans were carrying the torch for Nobody 2 on social with RelishMix noticing overall positive sentiment and very little negative chatter. The social media universe for the sequel at close to 190M was 59% above action-drama genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined. During Covid, the first movie's stats were 53% lighter. Interesting to note that the social media reach on Rami Malek's The Amateur was lower at 89M, but that movie opened higher at $14.8M.


	Sunday box office numbers updated in bold:


FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: Currently, New Line's original horror movie Weapons is seeing a second weekend -49% decline with $22M after a second Friday of $6M at 3,450 sites. The ten-day on the Zach Cregger directed, written and produced movie is bound to hit $86M by Sunday.


	Disney's Freakier Friday is seeing a $4.5M second Friday, with a $14M-$15M second frame at 3,975 and -48% decline for a ten-day of $55M. That total will be -6% behind the end of second weekend cume of the original 2003 movie which ended its run at $110.2M. 


	Universal's Nobody 2 is right now standing at a $9.25M opening after a first Friday plus previews of $3.8M at 3,260 sites. 


	Disney/Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four: First Steps at 3,355 theaters has a fourth Friday of $2.3M, fourth weekend of $8M, -49% for a running cume by Sunday of $246.1M. 


	Third weekend of Uni/DreamWorks Animation's Bad Guys 2 is $5.7M, -46%, for a running total of $55.4M at 3,374. That total will be pacing -3% behind Bad Guys through 17 days. Today is $1.6M.  


FRIDAY AM: Summer is ratcheting down and the only major studio wide entry this box office frame is Universal's Bob Odenkirk action movie Nobody 2, which did $1.3 million from previews Thursday at 2,800 theaters that began at 2 p.m. The $25M 87North feature production is eyeing a $10M+ start in a marketplace where New Line's Weapons is expected to rule with $20M+.


	The Zach Cregger-directed Weapons ends its first week with $64M, which is 17% behind Sinners' first week of $77.5M but 29% ahead of Get Out‘s $49.8M first week. Sinners ended its run at $278.5M and Get Out finaled at $176M. Whether Weapons has a slight dip ala Get Out‘s second frame (-15%) or Sinners (-5%) we'll know when we get into the thick of Saturday. Sinners saw a spike in its second Saturday over its first by 14%, while Get Out‘s second Saturday dipped 9%. Weapons‘ Thursday was $4.06M, off 9% from Wednesday's $4.4M.


	There weren't any previews on the first Nobody as major New York City and Los Angeles cinemas had just reopened roughly two weeks prior from Covid; that movie opened to $6.8M and finaled at $27.5M domestic. Previews here on Nobody 2 are right in line with Lionsgate's Den of Thieves: Pantera, which posted $1.35M in its Thursday before a $5.7M Friday and $15M opening. Russian director Ilya Naishuller directed the first Nobody installment, while Timo Tjahjanto has taken over helming reins on part 2 here. Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin wrote the screenplay based on the former's characters.

	











	Great grades on Nobody 2: 82% certified fresh critics and 92% audience on Rotten Tomatoes. That's not far from the first installment, which respectively did 84% and 94% with critics and audiences.


	The rest of top 5 for the week is as follows:

It's crazy that sequel are doing poorly while originals are exploding, instead of the other way other. Let's hope the trend for original project doing good in the box office continue.

I am not sure if that's really true. None of the last year's top grossing movies was an original (Inside Out 2, Deadpool, Moana 2, and Despicable Me 4). This year is better for originals but most of the top grossing movies are an establish IP (Lilo and Stitch, Jurassic World, How to Train…)

Don't worry, the Hollywood execs won't notice.

I miss the good ole days – when a movie didn't have to knock it out of the park opening weekend and there was a dearth of all kinds of movies to go see! Sigh!!!!

“Dearth” means lack, so maybe you mean a “glut” of all kinds of movies?  In any case, I do agree that long theatrical windows and a healthy variety at the multiplex are sorely missed 😕

Enter the doldrums of several weeks of 25 box office being behind 24. (After the last several weeks already).

Weapons is def coming in higher than $22 mil. It keeps beating expectations

Guess nobody will watch nobody 2.

I suspect the theatrical release is just to raise the film's profile for VOD and streaming, which is where the real money will be made.

Nobody's paying off a bunch of critics. I just think critics tend to be terminally online and prone to groupthink. I'll never be able to prove it, but I believe the RT scores of certain movies would be vastly different if each critic were to watch it in a vacuum. You get movies like Joker and Megalopolis where critics see everyone dunking on it for cultural or political reasons and decide to get in on the dog pile, and you see movies on the other end of the spectrum like Barbie where critics see everyone heaping praise on it and wouldn't dare to go against the narrative. 

And yes, I think Barbie was “better” than Joker and Megalopolis, but it doesn't take away from the fact that there are too many critics and many of them share opinions that have been crowd-sourced. They're paid off with likes and attention, not money.

“I'll never be able to prove it, but I believe…” the eternal motto of the conspiracy theorist.

Television

Or just someone observing human behavior. Admitting you see patterns but can't be certain doesn't mean you're wrong, it means you're smart enough to know and disclose you can't prove your hypothesis.

That one person keeps posting here week after week that it's “a fact” and “obvious” that RT/CinemaScore/critics are being “paid off” without having a shred of actual evidence.

This was meant as a reply to a different comment.

Guess everybody will watch nobody 2.

Sho Miyake is one of the finest, most soulful Japanese filmmakers of his generation. His recent features, all patiently-paced dramas about circumstantial relationships, share a compelling interest in the quiet. Not necessarily tranquility; almost every Miyake lead is outright depressed or a bundle of nerves about key issues in their life. 

Rather, he favors characters who struggle with loneliness, withdrawing from engaging with people much at all due to factors that make human connection harder for them. “All the Long Nights” saw two office workers suffering from different detrimental conditions form a supportive bond to ease their respective pains. And in Miyake's gorgeous, lo-fi take on a sports movie, “Small, Slow but Steady,” the quiet demeanor of its young boxer protagonist is due to a literal hearing impairment. She reads lips to understand people, while choosing to not articulate many of her inner thoughts.In Miyake's latest tender, beautifully textured feature (which just won Locarno's highest honor, the Golden Leopard), “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the main character's tendency to say very little is rooted in a creative slump, intertwined with cultural isolation. Li (Shim Eun-kyung, “Train to Busan”) is a Korean screenwriter for film and television, experiencing writer's block and struggling to still connect to her surroundings in Japan, where she's been based for years. At a Q&A session, she seems scared to answer the first question, suggesting that her main takeaway from watching her own work is that she doesn't have much talent.Within her own mind, she's a little more articulate. Japanese is the only language that leaves Li's mouth, but her occasional inner monologues are in her mother tongue, the most crucial example expressing her growing conflict with the very act of writing itself.

“Things happen in life that can't be put into words,” she thinks. “Surprise and bewilderment blow me far away. I want to just stand there forever, far away from words. But words always take hold of me without fail. Everyday life is about naming the things and feelings around us and blending in. When I first came to Japan, everything around me was full of mystery and fear. The things and feelings that used to be fresh have now been overtaken by words. I'm in a cage of words. Maybe travel is about trying to get away from words.”Traveling to get away from the noise of urban life, in the hope it might provide greater clarity or purpose, drives both female protagonists in Miyake's film of two distinct halves. Contrasting Li, whose trip occurs in the winter, is Nagisa (Yuumi Kawai, “Desert of Namibia”), a young Japanese woman wandering a seaside town in the summer. Avoiding the tourist traps, she connects, albeit awkwardly, with Natsuo (Mansaku Takada), a similarly lonely soul visiting his relatives nearby.Miyake's “All the Long Nights” was adapted from a novel by Maiko Seo and “Small, Slow but Steady” was loosely based on ​the autobiography of boxer Keiko Ogasawara. With “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the writer/director once again draws inspiration from previously published material, though while his switch to bringing manga to live-action might seem like a curveball, the creator he's adapting is an ideal match for the filmmaker's skill with bringing real interiority to fable-like storytelling.The hugely influential cartoonist and essayist Yoshiharu Tsuge is regarded as the first manga artist to have mined his personal life for story material, alongside being the first to make his characters' internal conflicts the central focus of his narratives — something uncommon in the medium until the late 1960s, even in the gekiga style of Japanese comics aimed at adult audiences. His introspective works would range from stories of ordinary life to more overt surrealism, their atmospheres tinged with dreaminess, eroticism and mysterious tensions.

“Two Seasons, Two Strangers” loosely adapts two specific manga short stories by Tsuge. In pairing the otherwise unconnected comics, Miyake doesn't quite follow the template of Jacques Audiard's recent “Paris, 13th District,” which interweaved the plots of three previously separate short stories by American cartoonist Adrian Tomine. Rather, to start with, Miyake makes Li the screenwriter of an adaptation of Tsuge's 1967 story “Scenes from the Seaside.” 

The film opens on Li at her desk, silently working out how to begin her screenplay's first scene. Bar the occasional cut back to Li writing a few more words, roughly the first 35 minutes of “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” are devoted to a take on “Scenes from the Seaside,” starring the aforementioned characters of Nagisa and Natsuo.The fleeting but fulfilling chance encounter between the two young loners has the air of a meet-cute tale, and there's certainly a romantic feel to how their situation develops. After first meeting at a secluded stretch of beach, they spend the rest of the day walking and talking, scheduling a second hangout at the same beach spot the following day. When a typhoon hits the town, neither is deterred from honoring their plans. Sheltered by a hut, he sits and waits for her as torrential showers surround him. When she shows up, they share dessert that he brought, both of them wearing what they would have anyway if the sun had kept shining, to the extent that Nagisa has a bikini ready underneath her dress to swim with Natsuo in the rain-drenched ocean.Despite the seemingly sweet resolution to their storyline (and an ostensibly upbeat last line of dialogue), there's a strange undercurrent to the Nagisa and Natsuo segment that suggests foreboding as much as potential happiness — a mysterious tension befitting the creator that Miyake is adapting. For one thing, their theoretically sensual swim occurs in stormy weather, the camera operator in the water with the actors clearly getting battered by the waves and heavy downpour. Elsewhere, part of their bonding is based around Natsuo sharing a grim childhood anecdote about seeing the bodies of drowning victims.Within the universe of “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the dark layer to the movie-within-a-movie can be read as a reflection of Li's despaired mind. The rest of Miyake's film finds Li years after her Tsuge adaptation was written, still stuck on the idea of traveling from the tale of Nagisa and Natsuo as she struggles to write another project — apparently about ninjas. The magic structural trick that Miyake pulls with Li is that she herself is the protagonist of another Tsuge story: an adaptation of “Mr. Ben and His Igloo.”

On Tsuge's page, that story concerns a male manga artist in search of inspiration, traveling to a remote village and staying with an eccentric innkeeper (barely) operating a business on its outskirts. In Miyake's film, Li finally travels away from the city to deal with both burnout and the aftermath of a sudden tragedy, trying out a deserted mountain inn run by the cynical Benzo (Shinichi Tsutsumi), after every other option in the snow-draped town lacks vacancies. The pair's initially stiff but gradually warm chats echo and augment those from Li's previous screenplay, including bonding over an understanding of deep loneliness.The build-up to the film's low-key, poetic resolution is made all the more moving by Shim's intelligent performance, which is effectively informed by the actor's positioning between two languages throughout, giving her a platform and reason to convey additional emotional nuances without dialogue — the performer, in a sense, also breaking free from “a cage of words” like her character. 

 










When working things out for the next chapter of our lives, we could all stand to get out of our own heads more to properly appreciate and take inspiration from the possibilities before us, instead of overthinking and then over-vocalizing our worries and doubts to the point of blocking our progress. To nod to a famous song that, like Miyake's filmmaking, suggests enjoying the silence where possible, sometimes words are very unnecessary.

“Two Seasons, Two Strangers” premiered at the 2025 Locarno International Film Festival.

	Conan O'Brien said that late-night shows will eventually “disappear” from television amid the “seismic change” in the industry, but that hosts like Stephen Colbert — whose Late Show run will end next year — are “too talented and too essential to go away.”


	Speaking at the Television Academy Hall of Fame on Saturday, O'Brien — a veteran of Late Night, Conan, and (briefly) The Tonight Show — said that, “Yes, late-night television, as we have known it since around 1950, is going to disappear. But those voices are not going anywhere.”


	“There's a lot of fear about the future of television, and rightfully so. The life we've all known for almost 80 years is undergoing seismic change,” O'Brien said (via Variety).


	However, O'Brien, who successfully pivoted to streaming and podcasting after his late-night run ended, added that those platforms are how younger generations are now ingesting comedy, as traditional television and its constraints are “a high-protein, chewable, vanilla-flavored capsule with added fiber.”

	“People like Stephen Colbert are too talented and too essential to go away,” O'Brien said. “Stephen is going to evolve and shine brighter than ever in a new format that he controls completely. So, technology can do whatever they want.”


	O'Brien added of an evolving landscape devoid of traditional late-night TV, “I choose not to mourn what is lost, because I think in the most essential way, what we have is not changing at all.”

	Leave it to Spike Lee to explode the typical high-stakes remake. His new film, Highest 2 Lowest, which opened Friday, flips Akira Kurosawa's mannered 1963 staple, High and Low, into a rowdy, topical, laugh-out-loud romp (starring Denzel Washington, Jeffrey Wright, and A$AP Rocky) that's as beautifully jarring as a dissonant sax solo. On a recent call from New York, Lee invokes the analogy himself: “Denzel and I in this film — we're jazz musicians. We respect Julie Andrews singing ‘My Favorite Things.' But when John Coltrane did it, you know, or when Miles did his standard of ‘My Funny Valentine,' it's a different thing. And that's why I call this a reinterpretation and not a remake.”


	Lee, of course, has been repositioning our world — always to provocative effect — for close to four decades. Since his hit 1986 indie She's Gotta Have it, his offbeat humor and peripatetic lens have imbued his characters with a salient, mock-heroic grace, foregrounding open notions of Black identity which feel eminently relatable. Still, he rejects the idea that he's a visionary. “Look, people gonna say what they want, but for me, my choice would be storyteller,” he says.Those stories are incredible. More than any other director of his ilk, Lee has persistently brought arthouse sensibilities to the mainstream. His most arresting movies are about everyday folks living out their lives in a Chekovian, destiny-in-lowercase dynamic. There's a painterly aspect to each of his films, where quiet transcendence aligns with larger-than-life chutzpah. 

	











Highest 2 Lowest continues that friction, giving viewers both a cinephilic treasure trove and a sympathetic Bronx hero in Washington's David King, a music mogul whose status and wealth make him and his brood the prey of an obsessive kidnapper. Rolling Stone spoke with Lee about his interpretation of this story, working with Denzel and A$AP, meeting Kurosawa, and more.

	











What do you think your artistic vision brings out in such a big star like Denzel?I don't have . . . That's him. That's D. You know, here's the thing, though. He's the star. He's Jordan and I'm Pippen. [Laughs.] But it's a team. You know, this is our fifth joint together, in order: Mo Better Blues, Malcolm X, He Got Game, Inside Man, which was done — it didn't feel like it was 18 years ago. Denzel said the same thing. But there was . . . we didn't have to relearn. I mean, it was like it was yesterday. So, I'm just happy that we got to do it again.


The classic idea of the leading man seems almost opposed to your work. Do you agree with that?I don't think that. I know what you're trying to say, because I've been very successful with the ensemble pieces. . . . But the five films I've done with Denzel have been very successful, too. So, I go with the flow, you know? And, you know, that just can't be booty [laughs] with Denzel in one of my joints. So, you gotta do what you gotta do.

You took on a giant this time, updating Akira Kurosawa's High and Low. Why did you choose to reinterpret this film?One of the reasons I love this Kurosawa joint is that it deals with morality. What will people do when they're put in certain situations? You gotta remember, a writer named Ed McBain [a pen name for Evan Hunter, born Salvatore Lombini] wrote it [the novel King's Ransom, on which High and Low was based]. So this was an American novel first, then Kurosawa adapted it into a film. I really wanted to get out there that this is not a remake. It's more than that. At the same time, respecting the source, the book, and the film. Kurosawa is one of the giants of cinema and one of my favorite filmmakers — and I got to meet him too! You know, I'm a collector, and one of the things I treasure the most is a beautiful portrait of Akira Kurosawa, which he signed for me. And he signed his autographs with the paintbrush of white ink. So I looked at that thing many times while I was shooting this film. [Laughs.] One of the great filmmakers of all time. 


	The film I first saw in film school, NYU graduate film school, which is where I first got to see world cinema, was Rashomon. It's a film where there's a murder and a rape and, he, Kurosawa, leads the audience to believe who's telling the truth. I used that premise for my first film, She's Gotta Have It. We have Nola Darling, and she has three boyfriends, and the three boyfriends talk about, you know, who this woman is. And she's talking about these three boyfriends she has at the same time.

Do you think that there's more pressure on you to portray what's dignified and regal about the Black experience, and sell that to the larger culture?No, I don't put that type of pressure on me. And Black folks are not one monolithic group. We don't all do everything and think alike. So I've never — or tried not to get mad. You know, when I get heat from my sisters and brothers . . . My sisters and brothers in Chicago, they did not like [Lee's Chicago-set 2015 film] Chi-Raq [laughs].

	











Really?Well, you don't live in Chicago. No, they did not like that film at all.


Wow. It makes sense that you would say that you're not specifically doing anything for Black folks as a monolith. ‘Cause I think that idea in and of itself would be in opposition to what you've always represented. It's always been a broader, wider—We are so diverse and so many things. So, for me to say, I'm just doing one thing; there's only one version of Black people, I mean, that's just . . . I don't think that's intelligent.


Do you think that you're more Jackie Robinson or Satchel Page?You know, that's a crazy question you asked me. I say that because my daughter's name is Satchel. And my mother's name is Jackie, Jacqueline, so . . . [laughs]  . . . But I think there's a lot to what you name your child. You know? And we Black folks, and I say this with much respect, we be making up names! [Laughs.]


Takisha, Shaquanda . . .Oh, I swear to God! We be making up names! [Laughs.] I mean, that's who we are. That's who we are. We're gonna do that . . . I mean, look . . . we're creative! 


There's an epic scene in Highest 2 Lowest where a subway chase occurs at the same time as a Puerto Rican Day Parade party.That's my homage to the director Billy Friedkin and his film The French Connection starring Gene Hackman. That film?… Whoo! Saw that in high school! And it's funny, the great sequence where he's chasing the subway, the L train, where that chasing starts was the subway stop [by] my high school. So it was shot while I was in high school, but I was in class, so no one knew it was being shot while we were in class. And I hope people go back and check out The French Connection. Great, great movie. Please watch The French Connection again. Promise me that. All right?I promise you, I'll watch it. What's your funniest or most interesting memory of A$AP Rocky's interactions with Denzel on set?For years, people, not just me, said that Rocky could be Denzel's son. For years, people were saying that. And I asked Rocky about it. He said, “Yeah, it's my” — his big ears. So to get the honor and the pleasure of having these two guys go after each other in the scene — generational. And here's the thing though: Rocky is not masquerading as an actor. He is an actor. And he came with his game, because he knew he had to. He just couldn't . . . this is Denzel here. So his thing was like, “I got testicles too!” [Laughs.] And that just heightened, to me, the drama between the two in the movie and where their characters are. A generational beef, in addition to all the other stuff that's going on in the film.


Yeah, Rocky definitely bodied that role, just brought a lot of energy to it.It was authentic, wasn't it?


Authentic as hell. I mean, Rocky's from Harlem, uptown! [Laughs.]. And Denzel is such a presence that people start getting weak in the knees if they have to go directly against him. That's how powerful Denzel is. And if you don't bring it, you just gonna be overpowered. But Rocky's like, “Fuck that.” [Laughs.] You know, sports: The best games are when they're highly, highly contested. There's no game when a team is blowing out the other team. There's no drama there! Right or wrong?

	











You ‘re right. Just like this last season with the Knicks.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You want one more question? 


Fair enough.So you enjoyed the film, though, right?

Brandi Glanville is hopeful that an infectious disease specialist in New York City is going to help her get to the bottom of her facial illness.

The former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star is in treatment with Dr. Michael Scoma, whose first course is getting the reality star on antibiotics and antifungals, per Us Weekly. 

“I always joke my life is like ‘The Last of Us?' I'm just turning into one of those black mold people. That's how I felt. I have lumps on my face, and they're moving around,” Glanville told the outlet.

She said of her condition, “Dr Michael Scoma said he wouldn't know if there was a parasite or not, because he didn't treat me early on.”

“But if there was, it would have been gone by now. A lot of this infection, in this deep tissue — the staph infection, and there's other problems happening — it mimics a parasite. It has this fluid that jumps around your face because it's spreading,” the mom of two continued. 

Glanville, who first noticed strange lumps on her face after filming “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip” in 2023, is hopeful that Dr. Scoma's treatment plan will clear her symptoms.

She discovered that she had a parasitic infection, and the lumps had spread to her upper body, causing a sensation of movement.

Now, the plan is to treat the infection and manage Glanville's stress, which can exacerbate her condition.

Dr. Scoma remains positive and told Us Weekly, “We can expect to see meaningful progress within the next few weeks, and I do believe Brandi can make a full recovery.”

A post shared by Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville)

Glanville is on her way to being rid of her parasitic infection. In an Instagram post shared on August 14, she told fans, “They say Twitter is the devil but all it took was me screaming in my tweets asking for help for this lovely man to reach out.”

“Thank you so much to Michael R. Scoma, M.D who specializes in infectious diseases for taking the time to meet with me and help me try to figure out what is going on inside,” she wrote.

The first picture shows Glanville with a much smoother face, while the third documents a shot of her getting an IV treatment.

Bravolebrities offered their support, with “RHOC” star Vicki Gunvalson writing, “Praying honey you find answers! I love your new haircut and you are looking fabulous.”

Sheree Whitfield of “RHOA” replied, “Hopefully, he can help and give u the answers and clarity u need!”

Glanville said in an interview with ET on August 12 that she was treated for parasites upon returning from Morocco in 2023. 

“If it was a parasite, that part is gone, but with all the inflammation … they left me with a secondary infection,” she explained. 

She said that numerous doctors couldn't diagnose her, with some blaming her fillers. “I haven't had fillers before COVID,” Glanville told ET. 

“I saw 21 doctors, and I had to have a tooth pulled,” the former model said, adding that she spent over $100K in medical bills.

When she's over her medical crisis, Glanville hopes to return to reality television, but she wants to do a game show. “They're fun. No one gets hurt,” she said.

Pete Davidson is reflecting on the time he was in “trouble” with NBCUniversal over the cancellation of his semi-autobiographical dramedy Bupkis on Peacock.


	In a sprawling interview conducted recently with The Breakfast Club, the Saturday Night Live alum candidly discussed everything from his sobriety to the tabloid fixation on his personal life. He also touched on his choice to end Bupkis after one season last year, which he said at the time was informed by wanting “a chance to tell my story my way” after having “nearly a decade of my personal life being in the media.”

	“I canceled Bupkis and I got in trouble for it 'cause I didn't— I love that show, I loved doing Bupkis, I had a blast, thank you [host Charlamagne tha God] for being in it,” he began. “It just got to a point where I got really tired of my whole career just being my personal life, and living through that is sort of traumatic — not to be lame — but it's traumatic to live in your own crap all the time.”

	Despite writing storylines in the series that he was “comfortable” with, Davidson said the show's direction took a turn once a new collaborator stepped in.


The Pickup star explained, “This new person came and was like: ‘I think Pete should be banging Martha Stewart this season, I think Pete should have more mental issues.' And I was like, ‘Oh, but I wouldn't do that.' And they were like, ‘Well, Pete the character [would].' And I was like, ‘I can't do this.' I was like, if I want any shot in being in real movies or being seen a certain way, I can't just play myself all the time and be this sack.”

	











	Speaking to how parent company NBCUniversal took the news, Davidson said: “They were not pleased. Have you seen me in any NBCUniversal [project since]? They were upset. I cost people jobs and I took care of the writers' room and anyone who didn't get paid that needed to, I took care of it — which also hurt. But, it's funny, you work for a company for over a decade — I'm pretty sure I brought in a lot of money, worked hard on that show, was a good boy, like promoting [it] and whatnot. It made me realize a lot about the business, like hey, I'm probably gonna die if I have to keep doing this and that's a problem.”


	While the Bodies, Bodies, Bodies actor called himself “very lucky” to enjoy success in the entertainment industry, he added that it “did kind of open my eyes where it's just like, ‘Oh, no one actually cares about you.' Studios, networks — they don't really care about you. They want you to do the thing, which I get. Now it's all good, but there was a time where it wasn't.”


	When asked if he was “blacklisted” by NBC over the decision, he said, “No, I think we're cool. I talk to everyone over there now and we're cool. There was a little time where there was some heat and it wasn't all good … and I understand why, but it just hurt because it was a place I worked for over a decade,” adding that there was a time he thought it “might be a wrap” on his career.


	Admitting he “had to step back and be in purgatory for a little bit,” Davidson also credited his ad with clothing brand Reformation in helping him “start to switch the narrative” and be seen as an “adult” in the public eye.


	Davidson can currently be seen on Prime Video's The Pickup opposite Eddie Murphy and Keke Palmer. Next up, he will co-star alongside Nicholas Hoult in Amazon MGM Studios' How to Rob a Bank, from director David Leitch.

I love Pete and this show. It's funny bc I first heard of bupkis on an old dick van dyke show where he'd written a song called Turkish, many years ago

I really loved this show!!! Just told my family to watch it…. couldn't wait for it to start again hate that he ended it but I understand

I imagine Peacock was pretty happy having a TV series starring Joe Pesci.

Friday (Aug. 15) was the late rapper's birthday.

	Ashley Iasimone



In honor of Nipsey Hussle‘s legacy on what would have been his 40th birthday (Aug. 15), the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) temporarily renamed Hyde Park station as Nipsey Hussle Station. Two limited edition TAP cards featuring the late rapper were also released on Friday as part of the L.A. transit agency's Metro x Culture series, which highlights the city's cultural landscape, artists, musicians and community figures.

	“The Hussle family is proud to be partnering with Metro for the renaming of the station in honor of Nipsey for his 40th birthday,” Nipsey's family says in a statement released at the campaign's launch. “Access to Metro played a vital role in providing transportation from South Central to Watts to pursue his early musical aspirations. Metro helped bridge the gap, not just between neighborhoods, but between his vision and his future. Metro provides access and opportunity to so many people who without this resource wouldn't be able to pursue their passions. The family hopes insight to Hussle's early years utilizing the Metro will bring light to Hussle's favorite quote, ‘The highest human act is to inspire.'”

	The TAP card designs — available in a release limited to 12,000 at select Metro station ticket vending machines, Metro Customer Care centers and through Metro's LIFE Program — include “Crenshaw & Slauson,” which shows a black-and-white portrait of Hussle at the intersection captured by photographer Jonathan Mannion, and “Watts” (seen below), which depicts the rapper on a Metro bus.

	











	The station known in the short-term as Nipsey Hussle Station will hold on to its new name through Aug. 31.Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins notes, “Hussle's legacy goes far beyond music. He was a visionary who understood the power of community, connection and opportunity. At Metro, we share his belief that public transportation is more than just a way to get around; it's a vital lifeline that can unite neighborhoods, open doors and uplift lives. Honoring Hussle with these commemorative TAP cards and temporarily renaming the Hyde Park station is our way of celebrating his enduring impact on Los Angeles and reaffirming our commitment to building an accessible, inclusive transit system that serves all Angelenos.”


	Nipsey Hussle died in 2019. He was murdered in a daytime shooting in front of his Marathon Clothing store in South Central Los Angeles.

Charisma Carpenter addressed fan speculation she would be returning to the queen bee character that first catapulted her to fame in the forthcoming reboot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 


	In a TikTok video posted today, the actress — who appeared as Cordelia Chase in both the mothership series and Angel spinoff — debunked any rumors she would be in the new show.


	“Hey, I get asked this a lot: ‘Are you doing the reboot?' And I thought I would address it,” she began in response to a comment. “I am not in the reboot. I am not in the pilot. I don't even know if the show has been picked up to go to series. I assume it will be.”

	Carpenter then addressed the launch of her new Buffy rewatch podcast titled The Bitch Is Back, the name of which she dispelled was associated with any kind of return to the Buffyverse.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It was not intended to sound coded in any kind of way, alluding to the fact that I was admitting to being in the reboot,” she said. “People were also then commenting, ‘Oh is this… Are you saying?' like it was an easter egg à la Taylor Swift. Not at all.” 


	She concluded, “I have not had a conversation with any of the powers that be to include Cordelia at this point.”


	Carpenter's statement comes after previous comments she made last month saying she was “so hopeful” to be included in the new iteration, given what she considered an “unjust” ending for the mainstay character.


	Carpenter's Cordelia was one of the original characters in the supernatural drama for the first three seasons. She continued playing the role in the 1999 Angel spinoff for an additional four seasons before being killed off in the fifth and final season. 

	











	As evidenced by star Sarah Michelle Gellar's dual resurrections, deaths in Buffy aren't as absolute. Previously, the actress, who is also executive producing the offshoot, expressed her desire to bring back characters on the show who had died while ensuring “space [is] made for new stories as well.”


	The sequel series, which currently has a pilot order at Hulu, will feature Oscar winner and self-described Buffy fanatic Chloé Zhao directing from a script penned by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman (Poker Face). In addition to Gellar and new slayer Ryan Kiera Armstrong, cast members include Faly Rakotohavana, Ava Jean, Sarah Bock, Daniel Di Tomasso and Jack Cutmore-Scott, as well as guest star/recurring cast members Merrin Dungey, Audrey Hsieh, Audrey Grace Marshall and Kingston Vernes. Chase Sui Wonders will also have a one-off guest-starring role in the pilot.

It's too early to tell. They're only filming the pilot so far and then Hulu/Disney will decide if they want it to become a show. Once that happens then they'll start filming the rest and cast other characters that aren't in the pilot. So like Charisma said she still wouldn't know yet if Cordelia is even in season one until it gets picked up. Even then since this show is focused more on the new slayer Nova and Buffy herself is a recurring character, they'll likely only bring in other “Buffy” characters when it's needed for the storylines.

Cordelia returning to Sunnyvale would be a great foil for Buffy. They have history and sometimes you do go back “home”.

Buddy, sunnyvale is now a giant crater. Ain't no returning there xD

I replied to correct Sunnydale, then my phone auto corrected to Sunnyvale, so I get it, friend lol… Really hope Cordelia and Faith make an appearance eventually. I hope Eliza comes outta retirement for this 🤞🏾☺️🤞🏾

Cordelia is dead in the Buffy verse, she can't just go back

It's possible that they are waiting for the show to get picked up or even see if it's a hit before trying to bring back a deep cut like Cordelia. At least, I hope so.

I don't feel like Cordelia's a deep cut. Even if she wasn't originally part of the Scoobys, she was a main character on the show as well as on Angel.

Maybe Charisma and Jennifer Love Hewitt could do something together?

That's nasty. There's no beef between SMG and Charisma.

…that we know of.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin met US President Donald Trump in Alaska, a video of their conversation after their joint press conference has gone viral. It showed the Russian leader's legs 'twitching suspiciously' as he bid farewell to Trump.

The Kremlin footage showed Putin's knee jolting repeatedly as he stood in a corner talking to his US counterpart, along with a translator, flanked by security teams and aides.

In the clip, the Russian leader kept dipping one knee as he stood beside Trump, making his legs appear wobbly, as he continued to raise his left toe and heel.

Ukrainian social media users and news outlets were quick to float conspiracy theories to explain the Russian leader's actions. While some accused him of wearing "hidden platforms" in his shoes due to a “Napoleon complex”, others claimed that he donned an "exoskeleton” to better his posture.

On X, many began theorising that the twitching and “jelly legs” were caused by a "mysterious" health condition. "Putin may be suffering from a mysterious illness. The 72-year-old Putin with a swollen face is suffering from jelly legs (uncontrollable leg twitching)," claimed one user.

Another remarked, “What the heck is wrong with Putin? Look at his body, almost convulsing, unable to stand still.”

Others theorised that the Russian leader never landed in Alaska and a body double was sent in his place to meet Trump. "I don't think a KGB Master Spy would shake his legs so much when standing. This guy ain't Putin," said one of them.

Many also pointed to Putin's absence of his usual “gunslinger gait.” The Russian leader usually walks with one arm still by his side and the other swinging, likely due to his KGB training, in which agents hold a gun close to themselves when walking.

Madison Iseman (Knights of the Zodiac) spoke to Bleeding Cool about her supernatural horror journey in The Avenue's Witchboard.



Madison Iseman is as versatile as they come in Hollywood, accomplishing so much in her career that spans over a decade since her on-screen debut in 2013's Second Chances. She's done her share of comedy, horror, action, and drama with memorable roles on ABC's Modern Family, Nickelodeon's Henry Danger, CMT's Still the King, Columbia/Sony's Jumanji franchise, New Line's Annabelle Comes Home (2019), Prime Video's TV adaptation of I Know What You Did Last Summer, and FX's American Horror Stories. Iseman's latest is the remake of the Kevin Tenney horror classic Witchboard. Set in present-day New Orleans, a cursed artifact unleashes a vengeful witch, drawing a young couple into a deadly spiral of possession, temptation, and occult terror. Dominguez spoke to Bleeding Cool about working with horror legend writer-director Chuck Russell, giving Emily the depth required of her character, the over-the-top practical effects sequences, and working with co-stars Aaron Dominguez and Jamie Campbell Bower.

What intrigued you about 'Witchboard?'

What originally drew me to it so much was Chuck, who's been around forever. He's so incredible and such a legend. 'Dream Warriors' (1987) was one of my favorite films when growing up. The opportunity to jump in with him was probably the number one thing that drew me to this. We had early conversations about what he wanted. The script was this fantastical take on this original IP, and it was fun from start to finish. He had all these incredible ideas, and it was something that I wanted to dive into. It was unlike anything that I had done before.

What was it about Chuck's script that stood out to you?

First, when my agent called me originally, they were like, "You're going to like the script." There are cats all over the whole thing, which I'm a huge cat lady. I was jumping at the opportunity to work with cats, but other than that, it was a fun acting challenge. Emily's a recovering addict. When you meet her, she starts a new restaurant with her fiancé. She's grounded, curious, and starts to get her life back together, and then she goes through this wave of emotions as she finds this board and gets enthralled with it, possessed by it, and without giving anything away, then somehow becomes a bit of a different person. So, reading it from the perspective of an actor, there was a lot to jump into that made me excited, and a lot of elements that I haven't gotten to do yet in my career.

I was wondering about that bed sequence with the multiple hands coming from below. How do you prep yourself to deal with that and go through the motions?

When I talked to Chuck early on, I brought up a lot of these scenes written on the page that were a bit larger than life, and one of my questions was, "How are we planning on tackling half of these things?" What makes Chuck so great is the practical effects, and he had all these crazy ideas about how we were going to get through them. The Hands was a big one because, written on page, it reads one way, but then you're like, "How do you pull this off?" I remember that day we showed up, he had a whole rig set up where they cut holes into the bottom of the mattress. We had about eight stunt people underneath me, choreographed the whole thing to where they stuck their hands through, and it was such a well-oiled machine from all the practical effects they did.

Even the one where I'm hanging over the bathtub, which is in the trailer, and they built a whole bathroom set on top of a 15-foot tank. There was a board underneath that would drop through whenever I needed to fall into the water. It was physically challenging, but I enjoyed jumping into things like that, so I told Chuck early on that I was pretty much game for anything he threw my way. We would bounce off each other a bit, and he would get excited when I got excited, and so we were a match made in heaven.

Was there any other sequence that stood out, and you might have had a hard time with?

I feel all the sequences on their own were a bit of a challenge. One of the sequences, I'm in the scene, but I'm not deep into what they're doing. There is a huge choreographed sequence about halfway through where a bunch of people get murdered. It was this incredible sequence, and we had such an incredible team behind the whole thing. It was a chaotic madhouse of everything. It was so beautifully done, but that was one of those things I remember reading it on the page, being like, "Okay, this is going to be a feat to get through." The fun part about that sequence is I'm standing off to the edge, which ended up being so great, because I was able to watch everyone do their incredible work and see it from the side. That was probably one of the most impressive sequences I got to witness, our whole time filming.

What'd you like about working with Aaron and Jamie on set?

They both have become such good friends of mine. They're both so sweet, and some of the most present actors I've ever worked with. Aaron's been such a dear friend, and he's so good as Christian. He's so grounded and brings our movie home, which is what I love so much about his character, because we're all these larger-than-life people in these larger-than-life experiences.

Jamie's so good and so talented. He had all the exposition in our film, so no one else could do it better than Jamie, explaining all these crazy instances we're going through. Also, more than anything, we just had such a good time. There are some moments when we're doing the most insane things possible, and all you can do is laugh and have a good time. We had the best filming experience. It's crazy because we filmed this so long ago, around 2023. It's fun to watch it come out now, and everyone else finally gets to experience everything we got to do.

The Avenue and Highland's Witchboard, which also stars Melanie Jarnson, Charlie Tahan, and Antonia Desplat, comes to theaters on August 15th.

Adrian Lee talks to ghosts for a living.

Lee is the son of two scientists. He holds a degree in graphic design from the Kent Institute of Art and Design at Kent University, a post graduate certificate of education from Goldsmiths, at the University of London, as well as a master's degree and a doctorate in art history from Open University. He's published 15 books and is working on a TV show that he hopes to get picked up.

Oh, and he's also met Johnny Cash. Well, sort of.

See, Lee's not your average historian. His investigations begin with the last source most people would think to question: the dead.

"As a historian, you only work with secondary source material," Lee said. "With all that information, you have an educated guess as to what took place in the era (as) we weren't actually there. It was remarkable for me as a historian to realize that you could have a conversation with someone that died 150 years ago and you can ask them what it was like."

Lee spoke to a sold out crowd on Saturday night at the Iowa State Fair in an event titled "Ghost Hunting 101: How to be a Paranormal Investigator."

Though he has conducted paranormal investigations around the world, most of Lee's recent work has been focused in and around the Midwest, with many episodes of his show "Unscripted Paranormal" shot in Iowa.

The State Fair was the pefect place for a hunt, Lee said, as fairgrounds tend to retain lots of spiritual energy.

During the his presentation, Lee walked attendees through the do's and don'ts of ghost hunting. Certain attire is strictly prohibited, according to Lee's rule book. Patterned clothing could be picked up by specialized cameras and cause a false positive. Light from flash photography can bounce off of jewelry, resulting in the same outcome. 

Lee and his team, who included Heather Morris, Steve Thaemert and Scott Kenner, explained how their equipment worked. They talked the crowd through the technology behind electromagnetic field readers, spirit boxes — also known as electronic voice phenomena devices — and structured light sensor cameras. Many of the devices are made or modified by the team, themselves. The older and less fancy the equipment, the better, said Lee, especially when it comes to EVP devices. 

Newer voice recorders come with settings installed that function to filter out the background noise. This is counterintuitive toward the ghost hunting trade, Lee told the crowd, because oftentimes the evidence they're looking for can only be found in the snaps, crackles and pops of the static.

A key part of paranormal investigations is patience, according to Lee.

"If you put yourself in the right place at the right time, law of averages, you'll start to see (ghosts,)", Lee said. "But during a person's everyday life, I mean, very rarely have I seen a ghost outside of my investigating...I think an average person's life wouldn't take them to where a ghost would perhaps exist."

Lee also professed psychic ability to the crowd gathered in Pioneer Hall, saying much of his communication with the spirit realm comes in the form of mental images, which he then transcribes. 

Lee said this psychic ability allows him to feel a physical empathy for the spirits with whom he speaks. 

“If your grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis, I'll feel my fingers start to get stiff,” Lee said. “Or if the person I'm talking to was hanged, I can feel a tighteness around my throat. Everyone has different things, but being psychic for me is almost like daydreaming.”

Lee said all of his books are all backed by historical research, though he added, most of the time his first clue as to what to look for comes from interactions with the dead.

As the event drew to a close, attendees walked out into the gathering darkness, sure to have a shiver or two running down their spine as they wove their way back out onto the fairgrounds.

A strange object hurdling through our solar system from interstellar space may, according to one of academia's most controversial astronomers, have been sent by aliens to see how smart we are.

The newly-discovered object, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, is only the third interstellar object of its kind to have been observed visiting our solar system. While most astronomers, including those at NASA, believe it to be a comet, Harvard's resident alien-hunter Avi Loeb has repeatedly suggested that it was sent to us by an extraterrestrial civilization — and may even function as something of a "Turing Test" for humanity.

In a new blog post, Loeb — who has become infamous in scientific circles for suggesting 'Oumuamua, the first interstellar object ever detected back in 2017, was an alien spacecraft — laid out his latest theory about 3I/ATLAS.

"It is well known to any interstellar traveler that there are plenty of icy rocks in planetary systems," Loeb wrote. "These constitute the leftover building blocks from the construction process of the planets."

"For that reason, an alien might assume that any intelligent observer on Earth must be familiar with space rocks as they impact the Earth on a regular basis," he continued, before advising: "Not so fast."

Though his case for 3I/ATLAS being a Turing Test sent by alien intelligence is pretty far-fetched, his insistence that his fellow scientists lack even human smarts is well-argued.

Citing "terrestrial comet expert" Chris Lintott of Oxford, who insisted last month that Loeb's alien-origin theory is "nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object," the Harvard alien hunter suggested that any extraterrestrial being who encountered such dismissals could "justifiably conclude that humans failed the test and do not deserve a high status in the class of intelligent civilizations within the Milky-Way galaxy."

Ouch.

As the Harvard astronomer has contended, the scientific establishment at large may have gotten it wrong by immediately declaring 3I/ATLAS to be a comet. He pointed out new Hubble Space Telescope images of the object to back up his claim, which show a "glow" ahead of it, but "no prominent cometary tail behind it, as is the case for common comets."

Loeb also pointed out that spectroscopic measurements do not indicate that there's any "molecular or atomic gas accompanying the glow around 3I/ATLAS," further undermining the theory that it's a comet.

To Loeb, there is one predominant alternative explanation about the origins of 3I/ATLAS if it's not a comet: that it's "a technological object which targets the inner solar system," and even perfectly times its "arrival time" for "a close encounter with Mars, Venus and Jupiter."

Obviously, in a Universe as vast and unknowable as our own, there are other, non-alien explanations for all those anomalous properties seen in 3I/ATLAS.

To test his alien-origin theory out, Loeb has another, even more provocative proposal: sending a Morse code message to 3I/ATLAS, and seeing if anything (or anyone) responds. When speaking to reporters, the astronomer said that his ideal communiqué would be "Hello, welcome to our neighborhood. Peace!"

As easy as it may be to dismiss Loeb's constant stream of strange alien claims, he does offer a fascinating alternate look at space rocks, and his notion that "3I/ATLAS is a blind date of interstellar proportions" is indeed pretty romantic to consider.

"As an optimist, I prefer to approach it with a positive mindset," Loeb wrote of the interstellar object. "How we follow the initial greeting with alien intelligence would depend on the data we gather."

Zach Cregger's horror thriller Weapons turned into a surprise crowd-puller and critical favorite. All thanks to its unsettling blend of mystery, gore, and psychological dread. Fronted by Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, and Amy Madigan, the movie dives into a small town terrorized after 17 children inexplicably abandon their homes one night.

They later vanish into the woods as if under a spell. The culprit, a parasitic evil with an appetite for human life, eventually faces destruction. But the chaos it leaves behind is laced with unanswered puzzles. And like any good genre hit, those loose ends are the ones people can't stop talking about.

Dream sequences in horror films usually scream “symbolism,” and Weapons delivered one that viewers haven't stopped dissecting. In a particularly eerie moment, Archer Graff (Josh Brolin) nods off in his missing son's bed and dreams of a hovering assault rifle hanging above the Lilly house, the place where the missing children are kept. The weapon ticks out the exact time of their departure, which is 2:17 a.m., and ever since, fans have been drawing connections. Many argue it's tied to the film's title and even to real-world violence, especially considering how grief, anger, and the survival of one bullied child dominate the town's storyline.

But if you ask Cregger, he'll be the first to tell you there's no single explanation. Talking to Variety, he admitted, “It's a very important moment for me in this movie, and to be frank with you, I think what I love about it so much is that I don't understand it. I have a few different ideas of what it might be there for, but I don't have the right answer. I like the idea that everyone is probably going to have their own kind of interaction or their own relationship with that scene, whether they don't give a shit about it and it's boring, or whether they think it's some sort of political statement, or whether they think it's just cool.”

So while the floating gun may look like a clear metaphor, Zach Cregger insists it isn't meant as a manifesto. The sequence exists more as a provocation, the kind of surreal imagery that pushes an audience into debate without handing them a conclusion.

just got out of weapons but I keep thinking to myself, what was the purpose of the floating gun above the dads house and it showing 217… like that was so random and not elaborated on at all #WeaponsMovie #Weapons

If anyone walked out of the theater unsure about who or what Aunt Gladys really was, that's exactly how Cregger wanted it. Played with unnerving calm by Amy Madigan, Gladys is introduced as a relative, but quickly unmasked as the story's true villain. Her powers don't come from a normal source; she thrives by siphoning the life force of others. Gladys stretches her existence far beyond any ordinary lifespan.

Hints about her past drop throughout the movie. At one point, Gladys refers to “consumption,” an outdated term for tuberculosis, suggesting she has lived since at least the late 1800s. Early drafts reportedly gave her an entire backstory chapter, but Cregger scrapped it in favor of ambiguity. The result is a character who feels ancient, almost mythological, without ever being explained outright.

Her presence ties into the central theme of parasitism, like how evil feeds, grows, and refuses to die unless completely burned out. That makes Gladys less of a stock witch and more of an embodiment of generational darkness, the kind of antagonist who lingers in folklore long after her last scene fades.

No horror movie is complete without one creepy object, and in Weapons, that item is Gladys' bell. Covered in cryptic markings, the bell becomes her most lethal tool. It is not just an accessory, but the key to unleashing possession. Its engravings include an inverted triangle and the number six, both steeped in occult history.

In witchcraft, the triangle (especially inverted) is often tied to the Crone goddess and feminine mysticism. The number six, on its own, is already linked with the idea of devilry, and when repeated (666), becomes synonymous with ultimate evil. Put together, the carvings on the bell read less like random designs and more like a label of ownership. This was Gladys' weapon, a ritual device meant to seal curses once she brewed them.

The details don't stop there. Viewers who stayed through the credits spotted the triangle flipped upright in the closing sequence. That small adjustment may hint at something alchemical, a nod to potions and transformations. Paired with the blackthorn branches she uses to control victims, the bell's role feels less ornamental and more central to her craft.

In the end, the exact function of the symbols is never spelled out, but that's the point. Like much of Weapons, the bell leaves audiences piecing together lore from scraps, a mystery preserved by design. One that may be explored further if the rumored prequel plans come to fruition.

WEAPONS SPOILERS-

–Something I haven't seen anyone discuss is the fact that the triangle in the title screen and the bell Aunt Gladys rings is the alchemist symbol for “fire”, but in a more metaphorical sense. Gladys is LITERALLY “firing” the kids as weapons.

The strange white light appeared above the sky in upstate New York on the evening of Aug. 12

 Residents of upstate New York were recently met with an unusual sight — a bright white light in the night sky with a strange-looking aura.


 The mysterious light appeared the evening of Tuesday, Aug. 12, per local news outlet the Times Union. 


 A number of area residents posted about the sighting on social media, with several speculating it might be a UFO, according to the New York Post.


 However, it turns out that the source of the light had a much more earthly explanation: Local residents were observing the tail and plume of the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which was launched on Aug. 12 from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at around 9 p.m. local time, per Space.com. 


 The rocket carried an experimental navigation satellite and was launched by the United Launch Alliance (ULA) on behalf of the U.S. military, per the outlet. It launched with four side-mounted rocket boosters in order to send the satellite directly into geosynchronous orbit.

 Additionally, it was the U.S. military's first experimental navigation satellite to be launched in 48 years, per Space.com. The spacecraft is designed to provide data similar to that of a GPS system and will test a variety of new technologies.

 This was the Vulcan's third successful flight. The 202-foot rocket took flight in January 2024 and again in October of the same year. 


 The most recent launch marked one of ULA's longest flights ever, at seven hours and 22,000 miles, according to the ULA blog.


 Upstate New York residents were looking up at the sky for good reason the night of the launch: It coincided with the peak night of the Perseids meteor shower, which lights up the sky each summer.

 The Perseids are especially famous for their brilliant fireballs. These exceptionally bright meteors burst with intense light and often linger longer than a typical shooting star. 


 NASA considers it “the best meteor shower of the year,” producing “swift, bright meteors that frequently leave long wakes of light and color.”
