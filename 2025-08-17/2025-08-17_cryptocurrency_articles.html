                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This marks the biggest deployment of cryptocurrency payments in healthcare to date. Wellgistics Health rolled out its XRP-powered payment system on August 13, 2025, letting over 6,500 independent pharmacies process drug purchases using blockchain technology. Pharmacies can now pay suppliers and move money in seconds rather than the usual 1-3 days needed for wire transfers or bank payments. For small pharmacy owners dealing with tight profit margins, these savings add up quickly. Brian Norton, CEO of Wellgistics Health, said pharmacy owners understand the benefits. “Independent pharmacy owners are far more forward-thinking than many realize,” Norton explained. The system handles compliance requirements that are crucial in healthcare. Every transaction gets recorded on the XRP Ledger, creating a permanent record for audits and tracking. Independent pharmacies face serious cash flow problems with traditional payment systems. This delay makes it harder to restock inventory quickly when patients need medications. The new blockchain system solves this problem by settling payments instantly. Pharmacies can now reorder supplies immediately after making payments, improving their ability to serve patients. The 24/7 operation means payments work even on weekends and holidays. Wellgistics already serves more than 6,500 independent pharmacies and 200 pharmaceutical manufacturers nationwide. The company secured a $50 million credit line to support its blockchain infrastructure development. The NASDAQ-listed company (WGRX) went public in February 2025 after being spun off from Danam Health. However, the stock has dropped more than 80% since its debut, closing recently at $0.62 per share. The company filed SEC documents outlining plans to use XRP for treasury management and capital raising purposes. The healthcare sector is slowly adopting blockchain technology for various uses. Prenetics Global Limited, a health sciences company, bought 187 Bitcoin worth $20 million earlier this year. Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin for its reserves. Wellgistics joins other companies that have added XRP to their strategic holdings, showing growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency for business operations. The pharmaceutical industry processes massive amounts of payments between manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies. Blockchain technology offers transparency and speed that traditional banking cannot match for these complex transactions. The next phase includes onboarding pharmaceutical manufacturers for direct blockchain-to-blockchain transactions. This would eliminate even more intermediaries from the drug supply chain. These would let manufacturers ship medications straight to patients' homes while coordinating with pharmacies and doctors through the blockchain system. The program currently operates in beta mode while pharmacies complete onboarding and training. Full 24/7 operations will roll out as more pharmacies join the system and become comfortable with blockchain payments. Wellgistics has created the first large-scale cryptocurrency payment system in American healthcare. Success of this program may encourage other healthcare companies to adopt similar blockchain solutions.

A viral Reddit discussion has reignited the debate over generational wealth-building strategies, with younger investors increasingly viewing Bitcoin as their answer to the housing crisis that has priced many out of homeownership. The central thesis gaining traction among millennials and Gen Z investors is straightforward: while Baby Boomers benefited from purchasing homes at dramatically lower prices decades ago, today's younger generations face a different opportunity in the form of digital assets. Today, that same home costs over $400,000, while median income has grown to roughly $70,000—creating a far less favorable price-to-income ratio. However, Bitcoin advocates counter that traditional real estate comes with hidden costs: property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and what they call “entropic decay”—the inevitable deterioration of physical assets. Proponents argue Bitcoin offers several advantages over traditional real estate investment: Global Accessibility: Unlike real estate, Bitcoin can be purchased and held anywhere in the world without geographical constraints or minimum investment thresholds. No Maintenance Costs: Digital assets don't require property management, repairs, or dealing with tenants. Portability: Cryptocurrency holdings can move with the owner, unaffected by local market conditions or political instability. Despite Bitcoin's recent surge past $100,000, skeptics question whether the cryptocurrency is still “cheap” relative to its risk profile. The asset's notorious volatility means investors must stomach potential 50-80% drawdowns during bear markets—a psychological challenge that many underestimate. Others warn against treating cryptocurrency as a primary wealth-building strategy, emphasizing the importance of emergency funds, retirement savings, and traditional investments. The discussion reveals deeper frustrations with monetary policy and economic systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$117,945.74 hovered near $118,348 on Sunday, up 0.39% in 24 hours, as two analysts outlined paths that could test traders' nerves: a dip toward $108K–$112K or a drawn-out range with room for altcoins. Lark Davis argues that if bitcoin continues to slide, the most likely landing zone is $108,000–$112,000. That range served as a ceiling earlier this year when bitcoin's rally stalled, and in market psychology, levels that once blocked price often flip into support when revisited. He emphasizes that this area also aligns with two classic pullback checkpoints known as the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracements. These measures, drawn from the size of bitcoin's last rally, are widely watched because they often mark where profit-taking slows and new buying emerges. While Fibonacci ratios sound mathematical, in practice they work as self-fulfilling markers since many traders plan entries there. Davis also points to the 20-week exponential moving average, a trend line that updates quickly with recent price action. When this line is rising into the same $108K–$112K area, it strengthens the case for support, because technical traders see both history and momentum meeting in one zone. When several signals cluster like this — resistance turned support, Fibonacci checkpoints and a rising average —traders call it “confluence,” and confluence zones often act like magnets for price tests. In other words, Davis isn't predicting collapse but a healthy reset. A rejection means sellers absorbed demand as the price tried to break out, a common signal that momentum needs to cool off before the next push. It showed bitcoin making repeated attempts at the top of its range but failing to hold above resistance. For van de Poppe, the message is not about deep retracement but time. It would also open the door to rotation into altcoins, which often outperform when bitcoin stops trending. Once bitcoin stabilizes, traders typically seek higher returns in large altcoins like ether before spreading to smaller tokens. Altcoin rallies rarely start while bitcoin is in freefall, but they often gain momentum when BTC ranges and volatility cools. In plain terms, the two analysts are describing different but compatible playbooks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a question that haunts more than one investor. Because behind its recent surge lies a very real but equally fragile shift. And yet… despite the enthusiasm, subtle but strong signs suggest a possible calm. Translation: institutional investors, who still favored bitcoin, now seem to bet more strongly on Ethereum. In August, this ratio increased from 0.05 to 0.15, indicating a massive allocation shift within portfolios. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC price ratio crossed its 365-day moving average – an indicator which, historically, signals phases of outperformance for ether. This growth is explained by a combination of factors: increased demand via ETFs, long-term investors rebalancing their positions, and a market sentiment leaning towards Ethereum use cases – staking, DeFi, tokenization. This suggests some holders are considering taking profits especially after such a rapid rise. For analysts, this level often indicates relative overvaluation of ether – a zone where reversals are common. Add to this a surge in activity on ETH perpetual futures contracts, with open interest growing faster than bitcoin's. ETFs support the rise, but strong hands remain cautious about a potential consolidation. To better grasp this moving dynamic, here are some key landmarks: Although the market sometimes wavers, signals converge: it is indeed the ETF and 401(k)-style retirement savings combination that could sustainably transform this network.

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and NFTs, a recent tweet from Adrian Newman has sparked intriguing discussions about wealth, taste, and the value of digital assets like Azuki. Posted on August 17, 2025, Newman emphasizes that being rich doesn't equate to having taste, and conversely, not being wealthy doesn't mean lacking it. He congratulates those who can afford high-end watches, noting they are decent pieces, while encouraging Azuki holders to celebrate their profile picture (PFP) affiliation with a prominent brand. This narrative ties directly into the NFT market, where Azuki has established itself as a blue-chip collection, blending cultural significance with potential trading opportunities. From a trading perspective, Azuki's floor price has shown resilience amid broader crypto market fluctuations. This uptick correlates with renewed interest in anime-inspired NFTs, positioning Azuki as a hedge against volatility in major cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC. Traders should watch support levels at 4.8 ETH, where historical buying pressure has prevented deeper corrections, and resistance at 5.5 ETH, which could signal a breakout if Ethereum's price rebounds above $3,000. Newman's tweet amplifies positive sentiment, potentially driving more holders to view Azuki not just as art, but as a status symbol comparable to luxury watches, thereby influencing on-chain metrics such as holder count and transaction velocity. Linking this to stock markets, luxury goods sectors like watches from brands such as Rolex or Patek Philippe often mirror trends in high-end NFTs. For instance, when stock indices like the S&P 500 rally on positive economic data, institutional investors diversify into crypto, boosting NFT volumes. Azuki benefits from this, with its brand partnerships enhancing scarcity value. However, risks include market-wide corrections if Bitcoin dips below $60,000, potentially dragging NFT floors down by 10-15% based on past patterns. Beyond immediate trading, Newman's message underscores broader implications for crypto adoption. Holding an Azuki PFP isn't just about aesthetics; it's a bet on community-driven value in Web3. With over 10,000 unique holders and a market cap equivalent to $50 million at current ETH prices, Azuki offers long-term trading strategies like staking in related DeFi protocols or flipping rare traits during hype cycles. For stock traders eyeing crypto correlations, events like luxury brand earnings reports could indirectly pump NFT sentiment—think LVMH's quarterly results on August 20, 2025, which might highlight consumer spending trends favoring digital luxuries. In summary, whether you're trading watches or Azuki NFTs, taste and timing are key; savvy investors should integrate on-chain analytics with real-time market data to spot entries, such as buying dips below 5 ETH for potential 20% gains within a month. This analysis highlights how cultural narratives like Newman's tweet can fuel trading momentum in the NFT space, encouraging a balanced portfolio approach that bridges traditional luxury with blockchain innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins - Crypto bridges enable cross-chain interoperability by transferring assets and data between blockchains using wrapped tokens. - They operate via trust-based custodians or trustless smart contracts, with security risks highlighted by the $600M Ronin Bridge hack. - Users must evaluate bridge mechanics and risks, as these tools drive blockchain innovation but remain vulnerable to operational and technical flaws. Crypto bridges are emerging as a pivotal innovation in the blockchain space, enabling interoperability between disparate ecosystems. These bridges allow users to transfer assets and data across different blockchains, effectively breaking down silos that have historically limited cross-chain communication. By creating artificial derivatives of native assets—known as wrapped tokens—crypto bridges allow users to spend tokens like Bitcoin in ecosystems that don't natively support them, such as Ethereum [1]. This is facilitated through smart contracts and oracles that relay information between the chains. Crypto bridges are broadly categorized into two types: trust-based and trustless. Security concerns have been a significant issue in the crypto bridge space. This underscores the importance of rigorous smart contract audits and thorough due diligence when selecting a bridge. Users are encouraged to research the operational history, transparency, and community sentiment surrounding any bridge before using it. Several prominent crypto bridges have emerged to facilitate cross-chain transactions. Portal Bridge, formerly Wormhole, enables asset transfers across major blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum. These bridges are not only enhancing user experiences but also enabling developers to collaborate across ecosystems, thereby fostering innovation in decentralized applications [1]. Each bridge presents unique trade-offs between speed, security, and decentralization. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanics and risks associated with each bridge is essential before engaging in cross-chain transactions. Crypto bridges are an essential component of the evolving blockchain landscape. As the technology continues to mature, it is expected that bridges will play a central role in the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. However, with the risks inherent in cross-chain operations, users and developers must remain vigilant in their choices and implementation strategies [1].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A closely followed trader known for calling the market cycle top in 2021 says that a sizeable rally to much higher prices is still technically conservative for Bitcoin (BTC). The pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave tells his 153,000 X followers that he's watching for a “conservative” Bitcoin price target above $150,000. According to the analyst, BTC is currently travelling upward inside a large ascending channel, the upper bound of which suggests that the price target could be met by November this year. In a manic, overheated market, [BTC] could go higher.” Dave the Wave says BTC.D appears to be topping, which has historically coincided with altcoin upswings. A downtrending BTC.D chart suggests that altcoins are rising in value faster than Bitcoin. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Centrifuge joins BlackRock's BUIDL and Ondo Finance in the $1 billion RWA club as demand grows for tokenized products. “Markets need more than T-bills,” Illuminati told Cointelegraph, pointing to JAAA, an onchain version of Janus Henderson's AAA-rated collateralized loan obligation (CLO) investment fund, as a natural next step for institutions seeking higher yields than risk-free rates. “We are also seeing rising interest in private credit as institutions look for differentiated yield, with more news coming soon on that front,” he added. Related: GENIUS Act yield ban may push trillions into tokenized assets — ex-bank exec According to Illuminati, demand has been “very strong” ahead of its official rollout in the coming weeks. The launch will be supported by an anchor pool of capital to ensure broad accessibility from day one. “We see strong potential for sector and thematic index products to come onchain next,” he said. Related: eToro to tokenize 100 most popular US stocks on Ethereum Illuminati highlighted plans to open tokenized assets to retail investors through major exchanges, wallets, lending protocols and DeFi integrations through the deRWA initiative. As reported, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) is also in discussions with major exchanges, custodians and DeFi protocols to license and list tokenized versions of its benchmarks, according to Stephanie Rowton, the firm's director of US equities. “By establishing these types of relationships, we hope we can work together to participate in a robust infrastructure that supports the trading and accessibility of tokenized versions of our indexes, ultimately enhancing the investor experience,” Rowton said. Looking ahead, Illuminati expects public market RWAs such as Treasurys and equities to lead adoption in the short term due to liquidity and familiarity. However, he believes private markets will eventually dominate, as blockchain removes inefficiencies and unlocks hidden value. In a report earlier this month, Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimated that tokenized real-world assets could exceed $18 trillion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 53%.

It's worth noting that this article does not aim to examine the three altcoins' market performance, price movements, or overall size (or any other honorable mentions that might appear from the AIs' answers). On why we chose ETH, XRP, and ADA in particular – it's simple – we usually see the most interest in articles related to them (and a few others, but they will appear later on, so stay tuned). Instead, we asked them to look for Google searches, social media engagement, projects' followers count, reposts, surveys, etc. While OpenAI's chatbot was relatively political in its final answer, giving ETH and XRP essentially equal popularity votes, the other three AIs seemed conclusive and determined that the largest altcoin rules. Grok was the only one out of these three that acknowledged its inability to leave out the recent market performance (ETH is up by 22% monthly, while XRP is down by 13%). It added that ETH has attracted a substantial user and fan base, but XRP's community might be as loud or even louder on social media channels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite this short-term decline, institutions are buying in big time and there is still long-term optimism for a drive towards $6,600, say analysts. In the meantime, fresh interest shifts to Remittix (RTX), an all-new ERC-20 token with real-world payment use case, which trades at $0.0944. Ethereum has continued to withstand the unpredictable trading conditions. ETH continues to be the dominant smart contract platform with a market cap of $533.02 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $42.82 billion (down 24.56%). Institutional investors are apparently buying on a wide scale, pointing to confidence in the next leg of growth. This institutional action continues to bolster the Ethereum Price Prediction, whereby a move above $6,000 can clear the path for new all-time highs. As institutions scoop up ETH, attention is also turning to upstart ERC-20 tokens like Remittix that combine blockchain innovation with real-world application. Remittix (RTX) is a low gas fee cryptocurrency project designed for cross-border payments with ease. Unlike speculative tokens, it enables direct crypto-to-fiat payment to bank accounts in 30+ nations, targeting a $190 trillion payments market globally. As soon as the presale exceeds $20 million, the team will be announcing its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, a huge milestone for liquidity and ease of access. The project has also announced the beta wallet launch for Q3 2025, including real-time FX conversion, multi-crypto support and easy onboarding for freelancers and businesses. For those investors tracking the Ethereum Price Prediction and searching for the next big altcoin of 2025, Remittix offers a rare combination of tech, adoption potential and early-stage growth. While institutions drive ETH's ascent, Remittix could be one of the top crypto under $1 that gets quietly positioned for mass adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is this the start of an altseason, or just another false alarm? Altcoin liquidations have overtaken Bitcoin on Binance in 2025. While signs point to an incoming altseason, key indicators show the market is still in transition and awaiting full confirmation. With many traders betting that altseason will kick off in August, leverage is piling into volatile tokens. Even Ethereum [ETH] whales are making hasty exits — one dumped stETH at a $50,000 loss amid a $3.96 billion unstaking queue. In a sharp shift from 2024, altcoins are now seeing more liquidations than Bitcoin on Binance. A recent CryptoQuant report showed that since early 2025, the cumulative liquidation delta has flipped in favor of altcoins. Both long and short positions are getting wiped out, so traders are overleveraging in hopes of catching big moves. As liquidations rise, so does market activity. Several indicators suggest that altseason could be brewing in August 2025, but it's not a done deal yet. The altcoins market cap has broken out of a downtrend for the third time in two years, with past breakouts historically leading to 150x and 175x rallies. The latest breakout hints at a potential 200x move, showing optimism and bullish sentiment across altcoins. Altcoins are beginning to outperform Bitcoin, but the trend needs confirmation. Reinforcing this is Bitcoin's dominance chart, which continues to fall, now sitting at 59.49%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This sparkling water, featuring zero alcohol and zero caffeine, will be available online worldwide, at select Base IRL events, and at select Coinbase offices. The announcement was made via a post on X by @rektdrinks on August 15, 2025, with the release date stated as “coming soon.” The collaboration with Base, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution backed by Coinbase, reinforces Rekt's strategy of partnering with prominent Web3 platforms to enhance its brand visibility. The Base partnership extends this model by aligning with a platform focused on accessibility and scalability, potentially broadening Rekt's reach to a larger crypto audience. By offering Based Lime at Base IRL events and Coinbase offices, Rekt taps into both physical and digital touchpoints, creating a hybrid engagement model that blends Web3 rewards with tangible products. This approach exemplifies how NFT culture can bridge digital assets with real-world utility, enhancing consumer engagement. Join Tekedia Capital Syndicate and co-invest in great global startups. Register for Tekedia AI Lab: From Technical Design to Deployment. The collaboration with Base continues to leverage this community by offering a collectible product tied to Web3 principles, such as potential rewards (e.g., DRANK points or $REKT tokens), which incentivize participation. The equity distribution to Rektguy NFT holders in 2024, a pioneering move in Web3, aligns community interests with the brand's success, fostering loyalty. The Based Lime drop could further incentivize community engagement, potentially through additional token or point rewards, strengthening Rekt's dominance in community-driven brand building. Rekt Drinks' prior success in selling over 600,000 cans and securing shelf space in 7-Eleven stores highlights its ability to transition from a crypto-native brand to mainstream retail. The Base collaboration could further this trajectory by associating Rekt with Coinbase's reputable brand, potentially easing skepticism from non-crypto consumers. The collaboration could involve NFT-based mechanics, similar to past drops where NFTs were redeemable for physical products and tied to rewards like DRANK points, OpenSea XP, or Abstract XP. If Based Lime follows this model, it could introduce Base-specific rewards, further gamifying the purchase process and reinforcing NFT culture's role in innovative marketing. By tapping into Base's ecosystem, Rekt positions itself at the intersection of NFT and memecoin culture, potentially driving speculative interest in $REKT and reinforcing its cultural dominance in Web3. For instance, the Ship Rekt drop with OpenSea involved 7,500 NFTs, each redeemable for a 24-pack of drinks, alongside rewards like DRANK points and platform-specific XP. Rekt's adoption of Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licensing for Rektguy NFTs allows holders to create derivative works, fostering a decentralized approach to brand expansion. This has led to fan art, merchandise, and community-driven initiatives, amplifying Rekt's cultural footprint. The equity distribution to NFT holders further embeds community ownership, aligning with Web3's ethos of decentralization. This model has helped Rekt build a loyal community that actively promotes its products, contributing to rapid sell-outs and mainstream traction. The Rektguy character, initially a free NFT mint, has become a recognizable symbol that resonates with both crypto enthusiasts and mainstream consumers. Its imagery on drink cans creates a seamless bridge between digital identity and physical products. This cultural resonance has made Rekt a Web3 phenomenon, with high-profile endorsements from figures like Snoop Dogg and Gary Vaynerchuk amplifying its reach. The Based Lime drop could further amplify this by tapping into Base's ecosystem and Coinbase's credibility, potentially introducing new NFT or token rewards. However, sustaining this dominance requires balancing crypto hype with broad consumer appeal, navigating market volatility, and addressing skepticism about NFT-driven products. Rekt's journey from a free NFT mint to a beverage brand in 7-Eleven stores exemplifies how NFT culture can redefine brand-building, positioning Rekt as a leader in the evolving Web3 consumer landscape.
