                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Looking beyond macro uncertainties and tariff pressures, it is always a good idea for investors to search for stocks that have strong long-term growth potential and enhance their portfolio returns. To this end, recommendations from top Wall Street analysts can help pick attractive stocks, as these experts perform an in-depth analysis of a company's financials and growth prospects. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. First on this week's list is social media platform Pinterest (PINS). While second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, earnings missed the Street's consensus estimate. Meanwhile, Pinterest's third-quarter revenue outlook topped analysts' estimates. In reaction to the Q2 print, BMO Capital analyst Brian Pitz increased the price forecast for Pinterest stock to $41 from $40 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on PINS stock with a price target of $40. Pitz noted that Pinterest delivered upbeat revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) in the quarter, fueled by the company's solid execution and the strength in the retail and financial services businesses. However, the analyst pointed out that Q2 performance was adversely impacted by a 25% drop in advertising pricing resulting from the company's rising market share in previously unmonetized markets around the globe. Pitz views Pinterest as a "Clear AI Winner." While users are gaining from AI-powered search functions and algorithm upgrades on PINS' platform, advertisers are using Performance+ Creative Preview to observe modifications made by PINS+ creative tools and maximize ad efficiency. "As AI continues to drive enhancements, we see it as a clear tailwind for PINS to both improve user experience and drive greater efficiency," said Pitz. The analyst added that advertisers are also benefiting from Pinterest's useful customer insights, given that Gen-Z now constitutes more than half the platform's user base. 95 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. We next move to the AI cloud computing company CoreWeave (CRWV), which reported market-beating revenue for the second quarter and issued better-than-anticipated top-line guidance for the third quarter. Following the Q2 results, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on CoreWeave stock with a price target of $180. Nonetheless, Thill remains optimistic, given that CoreWeave signed expansion deals with two hyperscalers, which he believes reflects "the unrelenting demand for high performance compute and CRWV's best in class capabilities." Notably, CoreWeave added 600 megawatts of contracted power, bringing the total capacity to 2.2 gigawatts. Overall, the analyst is confident about RPO acceleration going forward, given that AI demand continues to exceed supply. 317 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Finally, let's look at the well-known coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX). Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded Starbucks stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $115 from $100. Tarantino has "high conviction that turnaround strategies under new leadership will be effective in transforming Starbucks into a better company." Given the recent underperformance of SBUX stock – which has sunk by 16% over the past six months – Tarantino believes that it now has an improved risk/reward profile. He expects the turnaround initiatives under chairman and CEO Brian Niccol to drive improvement in U.S. comparable sales in Fiscal 2026. The company's turnaround initiatives are focused on ensuring high levels of hospitality and a faster speed of service in stores. Moreover, Tarantino expects to gain more visibility on SBUX's earnings outlook over the upcoming quarters, as the impact of the turnaround efforts starts to become clear. In particular, the analyst expects more details on Starbucks' cost-saving initiatives and greater clarity on store-level labor investments to provide insights into the company's long-term aim to revive its operating margin to the level of 17% seen in Fiscal 2019, compared to 10.3% in Fiscal 2025. Overall, Tarantino expects SBUX's multiple to expand on signs of improvement in financial performance, driven by the company's turnaround efforts. 441 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is not quite as keen as Tarantino, assigning a "neutral" rating on SBUX stock with a price target of $99. See Starbucks Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article Five-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," Witkoff said Sunday on CNN. NATO's Article 5 says that "if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday that she welcomed the security guarantees for Ukraine, and that the "European Union ... is ready to do its share," according to the Associated Press. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it is "a historic decision that the United States is ready to take part in security guarantees for Ukraine," according to a post on X. "Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe's participation," he wrote. Special envoy Witkoff's remarks come just days after President Donald Trump met in Alaska with Putin amid his country's ongoing war with Ukraine. Trump and his administration hailed the talks as "productive," but details of the meeting have so far been scant. The talks did not yield such an agreement, sparking concern among officials in Ukraine and European nations that Trump was moving away from the goal. Witkoff said Sunday that Trump and Putin "covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal" during their hours-long meeting, without providing additional details. "We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal," he said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Sunday that Russia will face "additional consequences" if Trump's effort to end the war "doesn't work out," but warned against implementing additional sanctions. "We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remain some big areas of disagreement," he said. "We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement, we're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made towards one." Trump is set to meet with Zelenskyy and European leaders on Monday. If the Kremlin did in fact agree to security conditions for Ukraine similar to NATO's Article 5, it would be a stark departure from at least one of the Russian president's previous justifications for attacking the country. Following Friday's summit, Trump said a peace deal could be reached if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the Donbas region, the New York Times reported, citing senior European officials. But Zelenskyy has been adamant that Kyiv will never recognize any of its sovereign territory as part of Russia, even regions Moscow has already annexed. Ukraine has also said it wants any peace deal to include guarantees that Russia will never invade again. "Everyone agrees that borders must not be changed by force," Zelenskyy wrote on X. "Everyone supports that key issues must be resolved with Ukraine's participation in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the U.S., and the Russian chief." Rubio also said Sunday on NBC News that "there has to be talk about what the territories are going to look like and what the border lines are going to look like at the end of this conflict." "There has to be talk about how Ukraine is rebuilt, and how do you rebuild a country that's been attacked as often as it has over the last three and a half years," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's easy to believe: Life gets busy, routines take over and conversations become more about logistics than connection. As a psychologist who studies couples, and based on my own experience being happily married, I know how tricky communication can become if you're convinced there's nothing left to say. But couples in healthy relationships make a habit of talking about things that matter, every single day. Their conversations stay fresh, connected and meaningful because they never stop learning about each other. Here are five things people in the happiest relationships talk to each other about every day — that most people neglect. Couples in thriving relationships always make a point to check in and make sure the other partner is happy. On some days, that means asking: "Do you feel loved? Other days, it's about expressing appreciation, sharing a laugh over a favorite memory or talking about something they're looking forward to doing together. Having these daily check-ins help prevent small misunderstandings from growing into larger issues. Regardless of whether their interests overlap, they stay curious about each other's passions. Over their years together, these little updates remind one another of perhaps the most important thing to remember in a relationship: "We're constantly growing and evolving, and we're doing it together." Happy couples are never stuck in the present or past. DON'T MISS: How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work Discussing dreams, no matter how realistic or farfetched, keeps the relationship future-oriented by instilling a joint sense of purpose and possibility. Even if a dream can't be acted on right away, talking it over allows them to keep track of each other's values. Happy couples aren't uncomfortable bringing up what's bothering them. Both partners will never feel like they have to carry their baggage alone. And these don't always have to be deep or profound. In fact, they're usually pretty silly, weird or seemingly irrelevant. I always remind couples that a big part of building a successful relationship is about being intentional with the conversations you choose to have.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With more families concerned about how they will afford college, some schools are offering an unbeatable deal. Although paying this tab is easy, getting in may not be. Each of these schools has high academic standards, experts say — and in return for a degree at no cost, the commitment they require, even after graduation, is steep. More from Personal Finance:These college majors have the best job prospectsStudent loan forgiveness may soon be taxed againStudent loan borrowers — how will the end of the SAVE plan impact you? "This is a self-selecting group in a lot of ways," said Robert Franek, editor in chief at The Princeton Review. Yet "it gives some hope for parents who worry about making college affordable — these colleges are doing just that." Here are the nine schools that don't charge tuition at all. But it doesn't stop there: Berea gives every student a laptop and funds to cover internship opportunities and even professional clothing for job interviews. Dubbed "Hard Work U," College of the Ozarks is a coed Christian school in rural Missouri geared toward serving students in the Ozark region. In return for a full scholarship, undergraduates must work 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks during the academic year as part of the school's work program. Since Deep Springs is a two-year school with no majors, many graduates go on to transfer to four-year programs to complete a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. In addition to free tuition and room and board, students receive a stipend to cover all other costs at this academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado. In exchange, the academic and physical demands are rigorous, according to The Princeton Review, with classes from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. followed by fitness training multiple times a week. After four years, graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants in the Air Force or U.S. Space Force and commit to several years of active duty. This New London, Connecticut-based academy is also highly selective and demanding, according to The Princeton Review. The extremely structured four-year program, which is fully paid for by the government, offers 10 academic majors, including civil engineering and marine science. After completing their schooling, students commit to five years of service, although many opt to stay in the Coast Guard for much longer, the academy says. Once they graduate, midshipmen can enter any branch of the armed forces as an officer. The service obligation varies depending on what type of job they choose. Every cadet at this prestigious institution in West Point, New York receives free tuition and a scholarship that covers room and board, in addition to a stipend for uniforms, books, supplies and all other expenses. Armed with a BS degree, West Point graduates then serve at least five years of active duty and three years in the reserves and are "ready for a lifetime of service to the Army and nation," according to the academy. All students on campus, known as "the Yard," in Annapolis, Maryland, receive a full scholarship that covers tuition, room and board and other costs, in return for at least five years of active duty after graduation, followed by the reserves. After their rigorous training, many midshipmen go on to have prominent careers within and outside the military, according to The Princeton Review. Founded by the shipbuilder William Webb, this small, private college in Glen Cove, New York specializes in naval architecture and marine engineering.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union is trying to prevent the United States from targeting the bloc's digital rules as both sides work through the final details of a delayed statement to formalize a trade deal reached last month, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The statement had originally been expected days after the July announcement by EU President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump, according to FT. The July deal imposed a 15% import tariff on most EU goods — half the initially threatened rate — and helped avert a broader trade war between the two allies, who together account for nearly a third of global trade. The U.S. wanted to keep the door open for possible concessions on the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on U.S. tech companies, according to FT, which added that the commission has said that relaxing these rules is a red line. The EU's DSA is a landmark law meant to make the online environment safer and fairer by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material. The commission had anticipated that Trump would sign an executive order by Aug. 15 to cut tariffs on EU car exports to the U.S. from 27.5% to 15%. However, a U.S. official signaled that this would be delayed until the joint statement was finalized, according to FT. Read the complete Financial Times report here. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The announcements on Saturday of troops from hundreds of miles away in West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio came a day after D.C. officials and the Trump administration negotiated a deal to keep Mayor Muriel Bowser's appointed police chief, Pamela Smith, in charge of the police department after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit to block the federal takeover of the department. Trump, a Republican, said this week he was deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops to Washington and temporarily taking over the Democratic-led city's police department to curb what he depicted as a crime and homelessness emergency. Justice Department data, however, showed violent crime in 2024 hit a 30-year low in Washington, a self-governing federal district under the jurisdiction of Congress. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey's office said in a statement he was deploying 300 to 400 National Guard troops to D.C. in "a show of commitment to public safety and regional cooperation." The statement said he also was providing equipment and specialized training. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster responded to a Pentagon request by announcing that 200 of his state's National Guard troops would be sent. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police members in the coming days, adding none of them were "currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state." Trump, who has suggested he could take similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities, has sought to expand the powers of the presidency in his second term, inserting himself into the affairs of major banks, law firms and elite universities. In June, Trump ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, against the wishes of California's Democratic governor, during protests over mass immigration raids by federal officials. Hurricane Erin, now northeast of Puerto Rico, has become a catastrophic Category 5 storm that could bring ocean swells to the U.S. East Coast early next week, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Saturday. National Guard troops often respond to natural disasters and rarely police U.S. civilians. Drew Galang, a spokesperson for West Virginia's Morrisey, said the state's National Guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to D.C. late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment. A White House official said on Saturday that more National Guard troops would be called in to Washington to "protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime." A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a formal order was expected to go out that would authorize National Guard troops in D.C. to carry firearms. The official said this order would affect mostly military police officers with sidearms. Reuters has reported that the National Guard troops would have weapons nearby, such as in their vehicles. The White House said on Saturday that D.C. National Guard members have conducted patrols on foot and in vehicles around the National Mall and Union Station. The White House said the National Guard troops are not making arrests now and that they may be armed. It is not clear how the administration could deploy National Guard troops elsewhere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A scheduled visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi later this month has been called off, according to Indian news broadcaster NDTV Profit. The visit that was expected to take place between Aug. 25 and Aug. 29 will likely be rescheduled, NDTV reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes at a time when trade relations between the two countries have soured with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing a 25% blanket tariff on Indian exports, and topping those with additional 25% in duties — expected to come into effect on Aug. 27 — as a "penalty" for India purchasing Russian crude. Both sides are in contact with each other, but a new schedule for talks has not been finalized, the report said. Trump's cumulative 50% tariff rate on India is among the highest on any of the U.S.' trading partners, and has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi. India has said it was being targeted unfairly, while calling out the EU and the U.S. on their continuing trade with Russia. "It is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]," the country's foreign ministry said in a statement earlier this month. India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Office of the U.S Trade Representative did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments. The U.S. is India's single largest export partner, with nearly 20% of its overall exports, or $86.51 billion worth of goods, shipped to the U.S. in fiscal year ended March 2025, according to the latest official data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As an executive counsellor and couples' therapist, I often spend my days sitting across from clients who are contemplating or already involved in similar situations. Most are not abusers, narcissists, or sex addicts who engage in serial cheating. So, what makes a person — even one who swears they would never cheat — suddenly cross the precipice and risk everything for an affair? Humans are wired to want the approval of others, and as social beings, our survival often depends on it. We "go with the flow," repressing our emotions to please those around us. But like a spring that becomes more tightly wound with each passing year, this can quietly lay the groundwork for a violent recoil. Here are five surprisingly common psychological pitfalls that can make someone risk everything for an affair. They listened to their parents, studied hard, landed a lucrative job, got married, had kids, and followed every societal expectation to the letter. For them, love and acceptance in childhood were linked to achievement, and they often reach middle age without having a clear sense of who they really are. It's no surprise that perfectionism is a trait I see in almost all of my high-performing clients. Children in volatile environments or those given inconsistent approval often believe that doing everything perfectly will keep them safe. Over time, they become weary of enforcing impossibly high standards on themselves and those around them. When an affair beckons, they may suddenly give up on trying to be perfect and double down in the opposite direction. For them, an illicit relationship can feel like being set free from their own unrealistic expectations — a salve that softens the rigidity that has framed their lives. People with weak boundaries often had parents who were somehow incapacitated — through addiction, poverty, feeling overwhelmed, or simple immaturity — and the role of providing emotional stability at home fell on their small shoulders. When an affair comes knocking, they rationalize it by telling themselves they have spent their entire lives giving to others, and now it is time to do something just for themselves. A secret relationship can be an unexpected but welcome reprieve from decades of unkind treatment. It can also be a subconscious form of retaliation, a decision to blow up the relationship once and for all in an attempt to save oneself. One of the first questions I ask clients who are contemplating an affair is whether they have recently lost someone or something close to them. Nobel laureate Albert Schweitzer is quoted as having said: "In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being." It is only in retrospect that things settle back into their correct scale and the situation can be viewed objectively. For some couples, an affair can trigger the demise of a marriage that had already run its course. Learning how to advocate for yourself before you reach any emotional breaking point is both a personal and professional superpower. Lisa Oake is a former co-host of CNBC Asia's Squawk Box.
