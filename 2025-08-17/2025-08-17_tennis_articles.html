                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The event's quick-footed and eager “Ball Crew” regularly enthrall the crowds as they zip across the facility's famous blue arenas between every serve and volley to scoop up balls discarded by the likes of Naomi Osaka and Carlos Alcaraz. There are 315 members of the agile work crew, and they range in age from 14 to their early 50s, according to team leader Neal Kitson. Each person is put through a rigorous try-out that tests their agility and speed for grabbing balls off the court in the middle of game play. This year, there were only 80 spots for newbies open. At 14 years old, Jayden Wong is among the youngest ball kids serving the iconic tennis tournament this summer. “It definitely feels a little bit pressuring, but I like knowing that the older kids are watching over me,” said Jayden of Bayside, Queens. “They have high expectations, but it's definitely not too hard on me — just knowing that we're all a team and that we're all just here to help each other out,” he said. His deep-rooted passion for tennis sprouted when he first picked up a racket at age 6 to connect with his four older brothers, who were enamored with the game. By age 10, Jayden was logging practices five days a week with the New York Junior Tennis League, and his family was capping off every summer with a trip to the US Open qualifying round. I want to be just like them,' ” Jayden said. Akari Weintzen's first year as a ball girl was when Italy's Jannik Sinner took home the top men's trophy last year at the facility's centerpiece arena, Arthur Ashe Stadium. “Obviously I skipped SAT prep!” said Akari of Murray Hill in Manhattan. And it's what I'm most proud of in my whole life — to be able to say that I worked the men's finals is really cool.” Akari herself first picked up a racket at 6 years old during an after-school program — and it was love at first swing. For Olivia Chen, her four years on the Ball Crew have brought valuable life lessons along with lifelong friendships. For her second year in 2023, Olivia, 18, was honored to serve as a member of the all-female Ball Crew on the court when fellow teenager Coco Gauff smashed her way into the history books. “The whole year's theme was to honor Billie Jean King and her fight for equal prize money in tennis. I was chosen to be part of the all-female ball crew for the women's finals championship and, wow, it was just so empowering,” said Chen of Bayside. “Billie Jean King came up to talk to us after the match had ended, and she explained to us what it was all for, and just getting to see so many confident females on court, getting to be on court with them too, it was just so empowering. The moment was a dream come true for Chen, whose parents had been taking her to the stadium since she was an infant. While the US Open lasts three weeks every year — which some extra days tacked on for Ball Crew training — Chen emphasized that she leaves every tournament with a trove of memories and new friends from across the globe. The sense of camaraderie is really there,” she said. “I know that if I look at anyone on the crew, they'll have my back on or off the court and I feel that same responsibility towards them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff's summer has not gone to plan since capturing her second Grand Slam title. After clinching the French Open title in June, Gauff has struggled for form on the WTA Tour, losing to players ranked much lower than herself. Gauff was stunned in straight sets by Dayana Yastremska in the Wimbledon first round before being knocked out of the Canadian Open by 18-year-old Victoria Mboko. The 70-year-old coached Serena and Venus Williams while they were growing up in Compton, California. Since then, Macci has also worked with Maria Sharapova, Jennifer Capriati and Andy Roddick. Macci, a regular contributor to tennis discourse, has discussed Gauff's ‘career crossroads' ahead of the US Open, suggesting she needs a ‘science-based plan' to fix her second serve and forehand. On X [Twitter] Macci said: “Coco will be OK as she fights and knows how to play. Coco will be OK as she fights and knows how to Play. “This will not magically go away and bubbles up more under extreme pressure that particular day.” When comparing Coco Gauff's serve to her rivals, it is evident she has a major issue. Over her last five matches, Gauff has averaged a whopping 9.2 double faults per match. Gauff also has the lowest winning percentage on second-serve points over her last five matches. Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Jessica Pegula and Elena Rybakina have all averaged over 50 per cent in this category across their last five matches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic's season will resume directly at the US Open, which will start in New York in exactly one week and promise to give a great show. The 38-year-old from Belgrade chose not to play official tournaments after his defeat to Sinner in the semi-final of the Wimbledon Championships, preferring to recharge his batteries together with his family and friends first in Croatia and then in Greece. The former world number 1 missed the Masters 1000 in Toronto and Cincinnati, a choice that has caused some concern among fans and insiders. Nole has not played an official match on the hard courts since the Miami Open final against Jakub Mensik and would certainly have needed to find a rhythm in view of a tournament that promises to be very demanding from an athletic point of view (also due to the temperatures). Although he has won four times at Flushing Meadows, Novak has always had an up-and-down relationship with this tournament and will also need a bit of luck when the draw is drawn. During a recent interview with 'Tennis365', legendary coach Rick Macci discussed Djokovic's chances in NY: "In my opinion, he is the greatest tennis player of all time and can never be underestimated when a tournament of this importance starts. He can definitely win the US Open, but you need the right conditions. If he has a very tough path and is forced to use a lot of energies during the first week, then it would become almost impossible to beat Alcaraz and Sinner in the final rounds. He will have to hope for a favorable draw and we will have to see how his body reacts to the various efforts."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The duo's red-hot Lexus ATP Head2Head series has already lit up Rome, Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 2025, and Monday's meeting at 3 p.m. EDT (9 p.m. CEST) in Ohio will once again have fans on tenterhooks waiting to see who can notch the latest success in one of sport's great ongoing rivalries. Defending champion Sinner has not dropped a set in reaching his eighth ATP Masters 1000 final and enters the match on a 26-match winning streak on hard courts. “It's going to be a very, very difficult match, but hopefully it's going to be, in any case, a good match,” said Sinner after he downed Terence Atmane in the semi-finals. That's what for us players is important, but also for the people who are watching… We will see what kind of fun is going to [happen] on Monday.” Alcaraz may have dropped two sets en route to the title match, but the Spaniard has faced a tougher path than Sinner judging by his opponents' PIF ATP Rankings. He held off ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals before downing third seed Alexander Zverev in the last four, and the seven-time Masters 1000 champion will be full of confidence as he chases his Tour-leading sixth title of 2025. It's going to be great,” said Alcaraz ahead of facing Sinner in what will be his seventh consecutive tour-level final. “He won the last one, I won the first two finals, so I think it's going to be really interesting. It's the first final [between us this year] on a hard court, so I'm excited about taking that challenge. “I know that Jannik, without a doubt, is the best player in the world on hard courts and probably on every surface right now, so it's going to be a great match and I have to be ready for that.” The Italian clinched a four-set victory to seal his maiden title at SW19 and reduce his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against Alcaraz to 5-8. For many, Sinner and Alcaraz's rivalry is defined by the contrast between the former's consistent all-around elite displays, featuring precise serving and cleanly struck groundstrokes, and the latter's sublime shotmaking genius and ability to string together unstoppable hot streaks when the stakes are at their greatest. Fans will be eager to see what sort of drama that intriguing combination produces on Monday in Cincinnati. “The ability of not having any weakness,” said Alcaraz on Saturday, when asked what makes Sinner such a tough opponent. “It is crazy, the way he always plays at his best. The capacity of being there mentally, point after point, not having up and downs on the match makes him really, really special.” Sinner has the opportunity to cut Alcaraz's lead with victory in Cincinnati as both players chase ATP Year-End No. Should Sinner triumph and improve his record for the season to 27-3, he would trail Alcaraz by just 1,190 points heading into the US Open. On the other hand Alcaraz, who is 53-6 for 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, could extend his Live Race lead to 1,890 points by defeating Sinner to clinch his first Cincinnati crown. Victory in Ohio would also banish painful memories for Alcaraz at the Lindner Family Tennis Center, where he held a championship point in the 2023 final before losing to Novak Djokovic in a modern Masters 1000 classic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was not a tidy match from either player, but particularly Gauff, who hit 62 unforced errors and 16 double faults. As a result of her latest defeat, Gauff could now be overtaken by Iga Swiatek in the WTA rankings. The serve has been a big issue for Gauff throughout the North American hard court swing so far, but she has still managed to find a way to come through a lot of matches in spite of it. However, when discussing concerns ahead of the US Open, former top 10 singles player and Grand Slam doubles champion Chanda Rubin explained how she noticed Gauff's demeanour being more negative towards her team against Paolini. “We saw it with the double faults, she handles it so beautifully, but we saw her start to get a little bit frayed, get a little irritated, kind of direct it to her team there, so that for me would be the only concern. Does she have enough matches behind her on the hard courts? “So, that would be my concern, but certainly she has that ability, she has the athleticism to turn it on and in New York she gets such incredible energy, I think that's going to go a long way for her. While there are big concerns for Gauff heading into her home major this year, there are also some about world number one and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka as well. This is something that former top 10 player CoCo Vandeweghe has spoken about, pointing out Sabalenka's major final defeats at Roland Garros and the Australian Open already this year. Vandeweghe commentated on her most recent defeat against Elena Rybakina, where she claimed Sabalenka was simply unable to dictate play like she is usually able to. I just feel like losing a couple of Grand Slam finals, losing early now, considering this is an early loss for a world number one. “I think we got to call question marks as to where she is at, because that beating that Rybakina gave her, Chanda and I called that match and it was, she didn't even have a say so in what was happening out there and for a big hitter that is definitely a gut check of, ‘I just got out-played in my own game style, now what do I do? Former world number one Lindsay Davenport then weighed into the discussion, claiming Sabalenka has more pressure as Gauff has already won Roland Garros this year. “We are talking about two players whose sole goal is to win majors, and to win the US Open, so looking at both of them I think it's equal, I agree with you guys,” said Davenport. “If you look at Sabalenka, as CoCo said she has had so many heartbreakers this year, she is going into the last major and she has not won one yet this year, so even more pressure on her. Little bit less on Gauff, because hey she won Roland Garros, so at least when the season's over she has at least one major. “But, when you get to the point where you are holding more than one Grand Slam it becomes about winning more majors. Her backhand is a little bit of a mess right now, she is going to have to figure some technique there, use her legs more, way too many errors from that side. And Gauff looked exasperated last night that this was still happening on her serve. They will both go straight into singles, which begins on Sunday, August 24, after Sabalenka revealed she would no longer be playing US Open mixed doubles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis expert Jon Wertheim was so impressed with Atmane's Cincinnati performance that he made a strong case for an emergency US Open wildcard. Taking out Cobolli, Fonseca, Fritz, and Rune (and finally going down to No.1 Sinner 7-6, 6-2) is worthy of an emergency @usopen main draw wild card….” This is where veteran Navratilova stepped in with her support. The nine-time Wimbledon champion responded to Wertheim's post with a simple but powerful two-word reaction: She won four US Open singles titles and reached the final eight times. Currently, Atmane is listed as an alternate for the US Open main draw. However, his semifinal run has boosted him to around number 69 in the live rankings. Atmane's path to the semifinals was nothing short of spectacular. Before this week, he had only one tour-level win all season. He came through qualifying without dropping a set, setting the stage for what would become one of the most remarkable breakthrough performances in recent memory. Next came his upset of 15th seed Flavio Cobolli in a tough three-set battle. He then beat rising star Joao Fonseca in straight sets, building momentum with each victory. First, he stunned fourth seed Taylor Fritz, the top American player, in three sets. The victory over Fritz was his first Top 10 win and came on American soil, making it even more impressive. He then backed it up with a straight-sets victory over seventh seed Holger Rune. His incredible run finally ended against world number one Jannik Sinner in the semifinals. Despite losing 7-6 (4), 6-2, Atmane showed his skill by not facing a break point in the opening set and pushing Sinner to a tiebreak. He also became the first Frenchman to reach this stage since Richard Gasquet in 2019, cementing his place in tournament history with this breakthrough performance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Highgate's Holly Brewester became a finalist on the manicured lawns of Wimbledon after an unforgettable experience at SW19. Brewester, 13, who attends Highgate School and lives in Highgate, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club. Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week. Brewester, who described Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka as her tennis icon, finished runner-up in the girls' U14 singles final – and revealed it was an experience she will never forget. She said: "It's a really good feeling to make the final because I've been here the whole week fighting to make it. "It's really inspired me to carry on my tennis because it's so amazing to be at Wimbledon and hopefully I get here as a professional one day. “Hopefully I will go pro, it would be great to do that. This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025, with Brewester representing Coolhurst Tennis Club. “Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while. “It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.” Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport. “This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.” Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu touches down in New York today to compete in a blockbuster new mixed doubles showcase at the U.S. Open that has drawn A-list talent - and fierce criticism. The 2021 New York queen will join forces with Wimbledon runner-up Carlos Alcaraz in a star-studded partnership while Novak Djokovic teams up with Olga Danilovic. Meanwhile, Venus Williams, now 45, will hunt the $1m top prize alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka as the boundary between sport and spectacle becomes increasingly blurred. Wimbledon champions Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have signed up for the two-day extravaganza with just one traditional doubles duo - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - receiving a wildcard so far. Two additional spots remain up for grabs. The event forms part of Fan Week next Tuesday and Wednesday - with U.S. Open singles action kicking off next Sunday (August 24) - as the season's final Grand Slam transforms into a three-week spectacle. Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has slammed the new format as something that "makes a mockery of the event" and branded it "an exhibition, not a proper event." However, previous celebrity mixed doubles alliances, including Andy Murray's partnership with Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, have captivated audiences and television viewers alike. For Raducanu, it marks a comeback to the spotlight at Flushing Meadows following her inability to secure a singles victory in New York since 2021. 2 Alcaraz disclosed he made a "special request" to partner the British No. 1 and playfully suggested she would be "the boss". Raducanu displayed her playful side when discussing the prospect of facing Ben Shelton's blistering 150mph serve. It's very difficult to return their serves. It's such a unique opportunity, and I think a lot of the females will probably be feeling the same way. However, not all the major stars will compete next week. 2 Coco Gauff opted against participating in her home Grand Slam because the preparation week is "already packed". So, I didn't want to waste mental energy on that." 1 Aryna Sabalenka declared she was remaining "loyal" to Grigor Dimitrov and will not pursue another partner after the Bulgarian withdrew with a pectoral injury sustained at Wimbledon. Jack Draper has selected Jessica Pegula as his new partner following the withdrawals of both Qinwen Zheng and Paula Badosa. The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There will be no shortage of entertaining matches on Day 1 of the tournament, and we here at LWOT have every match covered in our daily predictions, including Mackenzie McDonald vs Brandon Holt. While Goffin may be past his peak, he's still capable of producing the odd deep run in a Tour-level tournament almost every season. The Belgian's durability appears to be his biggest hurdle these days, and Martinez will look to wear him down. The Spaniard produced some solid tennis in beating Nicolas Jarry in Cincinnati, but his lack of wins on hard courts means Goffin might have enough to take this. It took Arthur Rinderknech three tries before he scored his first win in Winston-Salem last season. While Hamad Medjedovic has never played in this tournament before, he'll look to carry his momentum from Cincinnati, where he produced a spirited performance in a tight straight-sets defeat to Carlos Alcaraz. Rinderknech has steady hands, but it doesn't always feel like he dictates matches. Bu won 40 matches on hard courts last year in a breakout season. He has a meagre six match wins on the same surface this year, although he has significantly cut down his participation in Challenger-level tournaments. Tseng's struggles are also evident with five wins from 12 matches on hard courts. Bu is the reliable player who can physically overmatch and overpower Tseng on a quick court. He's a former champion and even during an injury-hit 2024 season, he stormed to the semifinals before retiring against Alex Michelsen. Their tennis demands a lot out of them physically. The first set is crucial as it could dictate the outcome, and Carreno Busta's record in this tournament gives him a significant edge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MASON, OH − The matchup most tennis fans wanted is here. In what has become the rivalry of a new generation of tennis phenoms, Alcaraz and Sinner's last four meetings were all in a tournament final. It will be the fourth meeting this year between the two rivals after Alcaraz triumphed on clay at Roland Garros and Rome. Overall, Alcaraz is 8-5 all-time against Sinner, including a 4-2 record on outdoor hard court. “I'm just really happy to be building such a great rivalry against Jannik (Sinner),” Alcaraz said in his pre-tournament press conference. “I think we've done great things in tennis in such a short period of time.” 1 Jannik Sinner will get a chance to defend his Rookwood Cup title. "My mindset today was in a good spot," Sinner said after having Aug. 15 off. "For my side, I'm very happy to be in a final again." Sinner, the reigning Cincinnati Open champion, will attempt to become the first back-to-back men's singles winner since Roger Federer (2014-2015). Sinner's dominance was enough to end the Cincinnati Cinderella run of Atmane, who began the tournament as a qualifier. Atmane won seven matches in a nine-day stretch, including back-to-back upsets of ATP Top 10 seeds in No. "He (Atmane) has beaten incredible players throughout his (run) to the semifinals, so I knew I had to be very, very careful," Sinner said. I wish him all of the best." Atmane arrived in Mason with just five tour-level victories. He'll leave with 10, has doubled his year-to-date prize money and will crack the ATP Top 100 for the first time in his career. Atmane didn't go down without a fight against the World No. The left-handed Frenchman landed 78% of his serves in the first set, notching six aces, to force a tiebreak, where Sinner would ultimately prevail. 2 Carlos Alcaraz has a chance at redemption. Two years ago, Alcaraz was the No. 1 player in the world when he fell to Novak Djokovic in a marathon, three-set thriller on Center Court. After an upset Round of 32 loss last summer, Alcaraz is back in the Cincinnati Open finals for the second time after knocking out 2021 tournament champ and ATP No. While Sinner has stayed at the ATP's summit for 61 weeks, Alcaraz has put together a storybook 2025 campaign with a tour-best 53 wins and five titles. He's now reached the final in seven consecutive tournaments after a second-round loss in Miami. Despite Zverev landing 78% of his first serves and Alcaraz playing with more unforced errors (13 to 8), the Spaniard grabbed momentum and didn't let it go, capturing a tone-setting break to open the second set. Zverev, who battled illness in a win over Ben Shelton Aug. 15, needed medical attention during the second set after fighting back with a break to take a 2-1 lead. I think we started really well with good rallies and a good level of tennis. Then, all of a sudden, he started to feel bad," Alcaraz said. It was a difficult situation for me and I just wish him all the best." Alcaraz has now won 16 consecutive matches at ATP Masters 1000 events and is 38-2 overall since the beginning of April. When he lines up against Sinner Aug. 18, it will be Alcaraz's 29 tour-level final and ninth at the ATP Masters 1000 level, with his lone loss coming against Djokovic in Cincinnati two years ago. "I'm really looking forward to playing him (Sinner) once again," Alcaraz said. "For the people, I think it's great watching our matches because we raise our level to the top and we bring really beautiful tennis. The Enquirer updated this story to include photos, quotes and match coverage of the semifinal match between Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the promising and worrying parts of Alcaraz's semifinal performance, where he admitted, “I started thinking about how he's feeling, instead of focusing on myself. MASON, OH—“It's never easy playing against someone you know is not 100 percent,” Carlos Alcaraz said after his 6-4, 6-3 win over Alexander Zverev in the semifinals here on Saturday night.After seeing what happened to the Spaniard early in the second set, those words may sound like something of an understatement.With Alcaraz up a set and serving at 1-0 in the second, Zverev stopped moving for anything that was more than a step away from him. He let one ground stroke go by, and waved at a serve while holding his racquet in his left hand.

With Alcaraz up a set and serving at 1-0 in the second, Zverev stopped moving for anything that was more than a step away from him. Alcaraz double faulted four times in that game alone, and sent a forehand long at break point. “And then my focus, I started thinking about how he's feeling, besides focusing on myself and playing good tennis.”All's well that ends well, of course, for Alcaraz. The first set was a good one from both guys, with sharp, all-court rallies and a mix of power and touch. Most promising for Alcaraz was the way he dug himself out of a 0-40 hold at 2-3, and then turned around and broke serve at 3-3. He saved two of those break points with deft forehand drop shots, and broke Zverev by sticking a crosscourt backhand volley a foot from the sideline. From there, Alcaraz's serve started to click, and he finished with 11 aces in nine service games. “All of a sudden he started feeling really bad,” Alcaraz said. “And then my focus, I started thinking about how he's feeling, besides focusing on myself and playing good tennis.”All's well that ends well, of course, for Alcaraz.

If Zverev is already thinking of New York, Alcaraz has one more piece of business to attend to in Cincinnati. What can he take from Saturday's semi into Monday's finale? On the plus side, he can be hopeful about his serve, and how much it can help him on these fast courts. On the minus side, he showed signs against Zverev that a second-set letdown was coming, something that had already happened to him twice here. Who knows how the set would have played out if Zverev had been healthy.But all of that is in the past, and now Alcaraz and Sinner can ascend into their private stratosphere, with the sports world as happy spectators again. Alcaraz, who is coming off a loss to Sinner at Wimbledon last month, sounds like he's not going to settle for anything less than his best this time around.“We really bring out beautiful tennis,” Alcaraz said of their Top 2 rivalry.
