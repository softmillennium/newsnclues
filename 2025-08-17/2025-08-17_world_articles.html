                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States believes that the European leaders are coming to Washington not to "keep Vladimir Zelensky from being bullied" into a bad deal, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. "This is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because Trump is going to bully Zelensky into a bad deal. We invited them to come," Rubio told CBS. "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelensky from being bullied," Rubio said. "They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. On August 15, a meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump took place at a military base in Alaska. The Russian side was also represented by Presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the American side was represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and returning to cooperation, and invited Trump to Moscow. After returning to Washington, Trump held a phone call with Vladimir Zelensky and later with the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland, and France, as well as with the NATO secretary general and the European Commission president. Later, Zelensky said that he would travel to Washington on Monday to discuss details of a potential peace deal with Trump. According to The New York Time, Trump also invited the European leaders to join.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff — one of three American participants in Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin — described on Sunday several major agreements reached during the Alaska talks that he said created strong momentum toward a peace agreement with Ukraine. Witkoff told CNN that Putin had signed off on allowing “robust” security guarantees as part of an eventual peace accord, including a provision that would provide for a collective defense of Ukraine by the United States and Europe should Russia attempt another invasion. “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as game changing,” Witkoff told Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” adding the Russians had also pledged “legislative enshrinement” of a promise not to invade Ukraine or another European country in any forthcoming peace plan. Neither provision has been mentioned in Russian accounts of the summit. Witkoff's public description of Friday's summit was the most fulsome yet of what was discussed for nearly three hours behind closed doors in Anchorage. Trump will meet Monday at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and several European leaders to discuss the matter in more detail. Still, many questions remained about how the US is assessing Putin's seriousness about reaching a deal, whether his promises can be trusted after a track record of violating previous peace agreements and what exactly Trump is willing to offer to ensure Ukraine isn't invaded again. Heading into Friday's meeting, Trump said he would be disappointed if a ceasefire wasn't reached and threatened “severe” consequences on Russia if Putin didn't end the fighting. But as he departed, Trump said he was no longer aiming for an immediate ceasefire and declared “we don't have to think” about sanctions after the talks. Witkoff said significant progress during the summit led Trump to abandon his push for an immediate ceasefire and instead work toward advancing a larger peace agreement. The other US participant in the talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offered a more guarded assessment of how close a peace agreement may be. “We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off,” he said on ABC's “This Week.” “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement, we're not at the edge of one, but I do think progress was made.” “It may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end to the war, there are things that Russia wants that it cannot get and there are things that Ukraine wants that it's not going to get,” he said. A breakout session during Monday's talks at the White House will explore options for security guarantees for Ukraine that would ensure Russia is unable to re-invade the country once a peace deal is in place. Zelensky and European leaders have said such assurances are necessary as part of a peace accord. Witkoff said the clause agreed to by Russia — akin to NATO's “Article 5” agreement that an attack against one country is an attack against all — was a workaround for Russia's insistence Ukraine never be able to join NATO. He described it as the “first time we had ever heard the Russians agree” to such a provision being included in a peace deal. Putin has not abandoned some of his maximalist ideas, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donbas region, where Russia currently occupies large swaths of territory. “The Russians made some concessions at the table with regard to all five of those regions,” he said, adding the issue would be discussed with Zelensky on Monday and “hopefully we can cut through and make some decisions right then and there.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terence Stamp, the British actor who became synonymous with Swinging London in the 1960s, has died, his family said Sunday, according to Reuters. Stamp first came to prominence when he took on the titular role in the 1962 film “Billy Budd.” The black and white drama, directed by Peter Ustinov, who also starred, saw Stamp nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor - the only Oscar nomination of his lengthy career. He went on to star in a host of films in the 1960s, among them John Schlesinger's Thomas Hardy adaptation “Far From the Madding Crowd” and Ken Loach's first feature film, “Poor Cow.” He was a star who rose from humble beginnings in London's East End, about as far from Hollywood as you can get. He was born on July 22, 1938, to parents Ethel and Thomas, a merchant seaman. In a 2013 interview with the British Film Institute (BFI), Stamp revealed that his father tried to deter him from a career in showbiz. But his mother, he said, “loved every second of it.” “He was a merchant seaman, he shovelled coal, and in that confined living quarters any show of emotion would have been considered unbearably flash.” Stamp would become one of the biggest figures of 1960s London, romantically linked to model Jean Shrimpton and actresses Julie Christie - his “Far From the Madding Crowd” co-star - and Brigitte Bardot. His only marriage came in 2002 - to an Australian pharmacist 35 years his junior - but that lasted just six years, according to the Guardian. Stamp famously roomed with fellow actor Michael Caine, who was also a rising star at the time. I can understand it: in many ways he was much more mature than me,” he said of Caine, who was five years older. “Caine gave me all my early values, like making sure you were doing good stuff, waiting for the right things – then as soon as he got away he did exactly the opposite. Ironically, more than two decades later Stamp went on to voice the role of Superman's father Jor-El in the TV series “Smallville.” Of his eclectic career - including roles in Hollywood's “Wall Street” and “The Adjustment Bureau” - he told the Guardian that he had no ambitions, adding: “I've had bad experiences and things that didn't work out; my love for film sometimes diminishes but then it just resurrects itself. “I never have to gee myself up, or demand a huge wage to get out of bed in the morning.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff on Aug. 17 said that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed at Friday's Alaska peace summit to allow U.S. and European allies to grant Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an impending deal to end the war.

“We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” Witkoff said on CNN's “State of the Union.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) carried out a drone strike on Russian military logistics in the Voronezh region overnight, damaging infrastructure at a key transportation hub, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 17. HUR described Lisky station as a key transportation hub for Russian military logistics. Earlier on Aug. 17, Russian independent outlet Astra published footage purportedly showing a fire at the station following the attack. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev confirmed a drone strike on a railway station in the region, though he did not name it. Anna Fratsyvir is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent, with a background in broadcast journalism and international affairs. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also backed "Article 5-like security guarantees" for Ukraine, saying the country must become "a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders." President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told journalists on Aug. 17. According to the presidential decree, restrictions were introduced against 39 Russian nationals and 55 companies from Russia, China, and Belarus. The Air Force said Russia launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile and 60 Shahed-type attack drones and drone decoys overnight on Aug. 17. Ukraine's military has reportedly advanced about two kilometers in Sumy oblast, just a day after Putin and Trump discussed a deal that would give unoccupied Ukrainian territories to Russia. In an Aug. 16 video, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico praised the recent Putin-Trump summit in Alaska and repeated Kremlin propaganda about the "root causes" of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. "Ultimately it is Russia's responsibility to end its blatant violations of international law. Russia's aggression and imperialist ambitions are the root causes of this war," the Nordic-Baltic Eight said after Putin's meeting with Trump. They also reveal other sensitive details, such as a menu for a luncheon in honor of "His Excellency Vladimir Putin." Trump appeared to endorse Russia's plan as the fastest way to a peace deal, abandoning the demand for a ceasefire and threats of sanctions agains Moscow, officials told the NYT.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air Canada's flight attendants plan to remain on strike, their union has said, defying government efforts to force them back to work and into binding arbitration over a dispute that has left more than 100,000 travellers stranded around the world during the peak summer travel season. About 10,000 flight attendants who work for Canada's largest airline walked out on the job early on Saturday amid a bitter dispute over what the union has described as “poverty wages” and unpaid labour. Around the same time, Air Canada, which operates about 700 flights a day, said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports. However, that timeline was thrown into question after the union told Reuters it would challenge the return-to-work order, which it described as unconstitutional. On Saturday, Canada's federal jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, said it was clear the talks had reached an impasse and that the impact was being felt by Canadians and visitors across the country. “The talks broke down,” said Hajdu as she told reporters that she had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order an immediate end to the strike and to impose binding arbitration. Hajdu's power to halt the strike stems from a section of the Canada Labour Code, which gives the minister unilateral authority to end work stoppages in order to “maintain or secure industrial peace”. Air Canada had reportedly previously requested that the government intervene to impose binding arbitration. Wesley Lesosky, of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the government was giving “Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation”. According to the aviation analytics firm Cirium, the airline had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, leaving some travellers stranded overseas and others scrambling to find alternatives during the busy summer travel season. Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully compensated for their labour. She questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada pilots, the vast majority of whom are men, received a significant raise last year. “We are heartbroken for our passengers,” she told the Associated Press late last week. “Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans, but we cannot work for free.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People protest outside Air Canada headquarters in Montreal on Sunday after the union representing Air Canada flight attendants said they would remain on strike and challenge a return-to-work order the union called unconstitutional.Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press Air Canada flight attendants will defy an order that they end their strike and return to their jobs after the federal government issued a back-to-work order, according to a statement from the Canadian Union of Public Employees. The company said Sunday morning it would resume flights after the Canada Industrial Relations Board directed the airline and striking flight attendants to resume service operations for all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights at 2 p.m. We demand a fair, negotiated contract and to be compensated for all hours worked,” the statement read. Outside of Toronto Pearson International Airport, union executives insisted the strikers won't back down. “This is a completely legal strike, with legal protests happening until 2 p.m. At that point, we will carry forward with the demonstrations. While Air Canada has not updated its earlier statement that flights would begin to resume Sunday evening, “I can't see how flights can resume without flight attendants,” he said. Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the federal government issued a directive to end a cabin crew strike, with one union official calling it "incredibly disgusting." As he spoke, lines of striking workers walked in a circle, chanting, “Say it loud, say it proud, unpaid work is not allowed.” They carried signs bearing the CUPE union flags that read, “We love our passengers, not poverty pay,” and “Would you work for free?” Several cars honked and people cheered for the group as they drove by. Even without the latest threat of continued strike action, the Montreal-based airline said the complete shutdown of service early Saturday, which left crews out of position for its flights, meant it would take at least a week to restore full operations. Air Canada warned further flight cancellations will occur over the next week as it resumes normal operations. The company did not immediately respond to questions about CUPE's announcement. “Air Canada expects it will take several days before its operations return to normal. Air Canada was unable to book the couple on another flight because they were all sold out, she said. We're just here waiting for another flight which might come, but we don't know yet,” she said, as she stood with her luggage by the exit door at Pearson airport. The trip cost them a total of about 10,000 Euros, she said. In a text message to Ms. Pasquin, the airline said it searched for flights “on over 120 airlines for three days before and after” her cancelled flight but was “unable” to rebook her. However, Ms. Pasquin had conducted her own search earlier, and found an alternate flight home, albeit by way of transfers at London's Heathrow airport and Newark, New Jersey, where the family must spend the night. “I never in my wildest dreams imagined the response from Air Canada would be, ‘sorry, no flights, good luck,” said Ms. Pasquin, who holds Aeroplan Elite Status in the airline's loyalty program. “The company has shown an appalling disregard for both our emotional and financial wellbeing.” While union members picketed outside Toronto's Pearson Airport on Saturday, frustrated travellers inside huddled against banded barriers, waiting to speak with Air Canada representatives on the other side. Some sat in corners or against walls with stacked baggage carts. Saturday morning, only to find out that it had been cancelled. “We're expected to be at work on Monday,” said Mr. Smith, of Kamloops, B.C., who was travelling with his wife and their kids. Travellers affected by Air Canada strike scramble for answers at Toronto's Pearson airport “Four different Air Canada representatives have said different answers to me in the last couple hours we've been here,” she said Saturday. Calls to Air Canada did not go through, she added. “We're dealing with an exceptional situation,” Benjamin Piper, counsel for the union, said Saturday night, adding that the order was used “to override a legal and authorized and constitutionally protected right to strike.” Christopher Pigott, counsel for Air Canada, said the Board was tasked with “getting Air Canada operating again to assist the thousands of people who are literally sitting in airports, in Canada, around the world, who are stranded.” Also during the hearing late Saturday, Mr. Piper argued that board chair Maryse Trembley should recuse herself from the case because of her past connection to Air Canada, creating legal grounds for a reasonable apprehension of bias. Ms. Tremblay said she was in-house counsel for Air Canada from 1998 to 2004, and later represented Air Canada in labour and human rights proceedings. Airlines work to add flights, make schedule adjustments in face of Air Canada labour dispute The airline had been winding down operations since Thursday in response to the union's strike notice, coming to a complete halt on Saturday when more than 10,000 airline flight attendants walked off the job and began picketing at major airports across Canada. As of Friday evening, Air Canada had cancelled 623 flights, impacting more than 100,000 travellers. The company said customers whose flights were cancelled, who did not travel and did not accept a refund or credit, will be contacted with new itineraries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, met in Alaska on Friday for their first face-to-face encounter since 2018. Trump then held a phone call with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and the leaders of several Western European countries which are backing Kiev, including Merz, to inform them about his discussions with Putin. The German chancellor told broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that “the talks have begun” on settling the Ukraine conflict, which escalated in February 2022. “They will continue on Monday [when Zelensky is expected to arrive in Washington for a meeting with Trump], and of course, the Europeans will play a role,” he said. However, Merz warned that Western Europe “must not overestimate ourselves. European unity is important, but the decisive role in this war will continue to be played by the US.” Trump “has the power, both militarily and with appropriate sanctions, to influence Russia,” he claimed. In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump insisted that Zelensky should “make the deal,” stressing that Putin “wants to see it done” and urging Western Europe to “get involved a little bit.” According to Moscow, in order for lasting peace to be achieved, Ukraine should renounce its ambitions for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the current territorial realities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mass riots took place late on Saturday night in a number of cities in Serbia, rioters attacked police officers, set fire to and destroyed offices of government agencies and political parties, Serbia's Interior Minister Ivica Dacic stated. According to the minister, the most complicated situation has been reported in the city of Valjevo, where up to 4,000 people participated in protest actions. "Fortunately, there was no one inside [the premises]," Dacic said. "Given the fact that the facility serves both as a residential and office building where people reside, a fire could have endangered their lives." According to the local police reports, some 1,300 people participated in protests across Belgrade and they cast Molotov cocktails at law enforcement officers. Up to 500 protesters gathered in Novi Sad, where the 50-meter-long concrete roof above the entrance of the railway station in Serbia's second-largest city collapsed in 2024 killing 15 people. "The police stepped in and restored public order in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Valjevo," Serbia's top interior official added. According to him, a police officer was injured in Valjevo, while a total of 18 rioters were reported to be detained. Protests gripped Serbia in November 2024, sparked by the Novi Sad railway station canopy collapse. Protestors blame the government and demand snap parliamentary elections. On Wednesday night, protests took place in several Serbian cities, accompanied by attacks on the premises of the ruling SPP and the Socialist Party of Serbia. Dacic said 27 police officers and more than 80 civilians were injured in the attacks that day. According to the Interior Ministry, protesters threw stones and pyrotechnics at buildings, five official vehicles and 22 pieces of equipment were damaged.</p>
