                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's much-anticipated return to Premier League action ended in frustration on Sunday as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, despite the celebratory atmosphere that welcomed the “Champions of the World” back home. For Chelsea, big-money summer signings João Pedro and Jamie Gittens failed to make a significant impact on their league debuts. Instead, it was 19-year-old academy graduate Josh Acheampong, starting in central defence, who impressed with a composed performance under pressure. The Blues, who dismantled Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final last month and followed up with pre-season wins over Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan, were unable to reproduce that attacking fluency against Palace. The home fans' chants of “We've won it all” gradually faded as frustration mounted with every missed opportunity. The winger came closest to snatching victory late on when he met a Marc Cucurella cross, only to blaze his shot over the bar from close range. Head coach Enzo Maresca will take positives from the resilience of his youthful side but knows his team must rediscover their cutting edge quickly if they are to mount a serious challenge in the league this season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As of August 2025, 210 countries feature in the FIFA men's rankings - with East African nation Eritrea unranked as they have not played a competitive match in the last four years. It has been claimed that their governing body often take the decision to postpone games to avoid players trying escape from the country and request political asylum when playing away games. However, 17 countries have been suspended from football - including one who remain unable to play in competitive fixtures. Having hosted the 2018 World Cup won by France, Russia were banned by FIFA and UEFA in May 2022 - following on from the invasion of Ukraine and a plethora of European associations refusing to play them. In recent times Russia have played Belarus, Nigeria, Zambia and Grenada in unofficial friendly fixtures and Donald Trump has hinted at Russia returning. At the first meeting of his administration's 2026 World Cup task force, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he hopes "peace will happen and Russia can be readmitted - which prompted the US president to reply, "That could be a good incentive, right? Fellow World Cup hosts South Africa were banned during the period of racial apartheid. The suspension was lifted properly in 1991 when apartheid was nearing its end and they won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996. For different reasons, Mexico were banned from two tournaments because they fielded four overage players during a qualifying round for a world junior tournament. His actions led to him being banned for life and his country suffered too as they were not allowed to compete at the 1994 World Cup. In the 1950 World Cup, the first since 1938, Germany and Japan were barred due to their actions during World War II. Pakistan were first suspended by FIFA when its federation's offices came under the control of an administrator, who had been put in place by a court in a move which breached FIFA's third-party rules. It was lifted in March after the PFF agreed to comply. Josh is a sports journalist who specialises in football and WWE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's Premier League campaign has begun with something of a whimper. The FIFA Club World Cup champions looked under-prepared, a legacy surely of their summer exertions and late return to pre-season preparations, as Crystal Palace secured a point at Stamford Bridge. Enzo Maresca, a frustrated figure on the touchline, must have feared it might be like this. With co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali watching on, Chelsea struggled for long periods to cope with Palace's aggressive approach. Chelsea's best first-half opportunity fell to Trevoh Chalobah, who skied over the bar from close range. Then substitute Andrey Santos skied wastefully over the bar from inside the penalty box and with that effort went Chelsea's chance of a winning start. Tim Spiers dissects the main talking points at a sun-drenched Stamford Bridge. With Tosin Adarabioyo out injured and absent with a “small problem”, according to Maresca, teenager Josh Acheampong stepped up to fill Chelsea's Colwill-shaped hole. Acheampong may have previously played a few games in the Conference League, started two Premier League games (including against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park last season) and even a Club World Cup group-stage appearance against Esperance, but this was surely the biggest game of his career; a chance on the opening day of the season to prove his worth and cement a place in the first XI. Acheampong did look a little nervous early on — and one slack pass straight to Eze launched a Palace attack from which they won the free kick that led to their disallowed goal. However, Acheampong was by no means the only guilty offender here, with Reece James and Chalobah also playing misplaced passes as Palace's incessant press, applauded by Oliver Glasner, stifled Chelsea. In fact, Chelsea arguably had more success when they went agriculturally long, with a couple of direct balls bypassing the press and getting them briskly on the attack. It was a perfectly timed sliding tackle and then he was up on his feet to get to the loose ball ahead of Mateta. The rabble-rousing moment brought Stamford Bridge to its feet. Footballers need no excuse to make loud, vociferous appeals if they think they've been wronged in any way, but when Eze struck a thunderbolt of a free kick through both the Chelsea wall and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, it appeared to be a clean goal. Eze and Palace celebrated wholeheartedly and Chelsea's players stood motionless, although their bench, led by set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva, were straight into the ear of the fourth official Michael Salisbury and it soon became clear why. As Eze struck the ball, Guehi shoved Caicedo to one side, creating a gap through which Eze placed his shot. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.” It turns out that, as of 2019, the laws of the game state that when three or more defending team players form a wall at a free kick, all attacking players must remain at least one metre from the wall until the ball is in play. Referee announcement: “After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Given how late it finished and that they have therefore had a truncated start to this season, starting pre-season training on August 4, 13 days before their Premier League opener, a lot of focus will be placed on how fatigued or fresh Maresca's players are throughout the campaign. But there is no doub that this was a sluggish Chelsea display. They struggled to create chances, continuously ran down blind alleys and barely tested visiting goalkeeper Dean Henderson. In fact, after the third minute, they failed to muster a solitary attempt on target until substitute Liam Delap's shot was saved in the 90th minute. Credit should be given to Palace for the way they restricted space for the strangely subdued Cole Palmer, while Pedro Neto and debutant Jamie Gittens were often doubled up on by Palace defenders and rendered largely ineffective. But Chelsea never found solutions to these issues. So yes, Chelsea did look undercooked and lacking inspiration, but whether that was down to their Club World Cup exertions and a late start to pre-season, only they will know. A drab afternoon needed a lift and Estevao briefly provided it, skidding away from Guehi when he got his first chance to run at Palace's defence, before slamming a cross at Neto's head. It was one of the game's best moments and the atmosphere was as loud as it had been all day. The 18-year-old tried to give Chelsea what they needed; unpredictability and gusto. Not Malo Gusto, whose brainless 30-yarder into row Z in the 89th minute was met by howls of derision and summed up Chelsea's afternoon. Estevao almost crowned his debut with a goal in front of Brazilian legend Romario, who was watching in the stands, but when meeting a cross in a great position he let the ball bounce off him before, off balance, blazing the ball over. He also earned a very well deserved booking when wiping out Munoz as the Palace man looked to break. If orange cards were a thing, this was worthy of one. Estevao certainly has the capacity to add excitement and thrills to Chelsea's play, as does his fellow Brazilian Joao Pedro, but in contrast this was a fairly forgettable Stamford Bridge bow for the former Brighton man. His struggles reflected those of the team as he often failed to find space and room to influence the game, often dropping off Guehi to link play but with nothing of note in front of goal. Delap, in what could prove to be a familiar substitution this season, replaced Joao Pedro and was more unsettling for the Palace defenders, using his power and physicality to get into some great positions, but the finishing touch, as with all Chelsea's players, just wasn't there. In fact, it was a third Brazilian, substitute Andrey Santos, who arguably had the game's best opportunity in stoppage time, a free shot just inside the box… but you could almost see what was going to happen when he took a big swing backwards of his left boot. On whether Chelsea looked under-prepared: “I don't think so because, until the end, we competed. For sure, (Palace) have already played seven, eight games.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Chelsea signing Estevao came closest to snatching a winner, but the newly-crowned world champions were blunt in attack against a well-organised Palace defence. Chelsea suffered a Club World Cup hangover as they were lucky to escape with a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace to open their Premier League campaign on Sunday (Aug 17). Palace were denied an early opener when Eberechi Eze's free-kick was ruled out by a VAR review for Marc Guehi obstructing the Chelsea wall. New Chelsea signing Estevao came closest to snatching a winner, but the newly-crowned world champions were blunt in attack against a well-organised Palace defence. The Eagles' key duo, Guehi and Eze, started despite mounting speculation that the England internationals are set to join Liverpool and Tottenham, respectively. Chelsea's demolition of European champions Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup last month had raised the Blues' hopes that they can Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro shone in the 3-0 win over PSG in New York 35 days ago, but were anonymous as Enzo Maresca had to turn to his bench for inspiration. Estevao scored against Chelsea at the Club World Cup in his final game for Palmeiras. Chris Wood struck twice, either side of Dan Ndyoe's debut goal for Forest, on a nightmare afternoon for new Brentford boss Keith Andrews. Thomas Frank left to take charge of Tottenham, Mbeumo got his dream move to United, and Arsenal secured Christian Norgaard. Yoane Wissa was also missing from the Brentford squad ahead of an expected move to Newcastle. Arsenal, runners-up for the last three seasons, begin their quest for a first title in 22 years later away at a revamped Manchester United.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's 2025–26 Premier League campaign got underway with a splutter as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge. The FIFA Club World Cup champions handed starts to new signings João Pedro and Jamie Gittens—the former given the nod over fellow new arrival Liam Delap—and teenager Josh Acheampong, who lined up alongside Trevoh Chalobah in central defence. There was almost an early breakthrough for the Blues as Marc Cucurella's flicked header from Reece James's in-swinging corner was cleared off the line by Crystal Palace's Ismaïla Sarr, but ten minutes later it looked as if Chelsea had fallen behind. the in-demand attacking midfielder who is front and centre of Tottenham Hotspur's transfer radar, rocketed home from 20 yards out, bursting through the hands of goalkeeper Robert Sánchez. Enzo Maresca's side lacked any real cohesion, with Palace relatively comfortable throughout the remainder of the first half and for most of the second, and Jean-Philippe Mateta was denied by a smart save from Sánchez. Estêvão was introduced ten minutes into the second half, replacing Gittens, and he had a big opportunity to open his Chelsea account soon after. The talented Brazilian couldn't control his effort, though, firing over the bar after Cole Palmer had managed to squeak a cross into Palace's penalty area. Cucurella was also involved, squaring the ball for Santos after a tremendous touch from Delap, but he blazed his effort high over the bar to sum up the home side's afternoon. The stalemate marked the first time in 2025 that Chelsea have failed to score at home, handing Palace a valuable point in what could turn out to be Eze's final appearance for the club.

The England international had a forgettable day as the Blues' new wonderkid outshone his fellow new signings in a dull Premier League stalemate

Chelsea were brought back down to earth after their Club World Cup triumph with a goalless draw against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

The home side, who won the United States-based competition just last month, started on the front foot when Marc Cucurella's looping header was cleared off the line by Ismaila Sarr. 

Controversy reigned in the 13th minute when Eberechi Eze's piledriver free-kick was ruled out as referee Darren England ruled for an infringement, following a VAR review, against Marc Guehi.

After being beaten for pace for Eze's effort, Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez did well to spread himself to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta soon after, as Palace turned the screw. Although Chelsea struggled to seize control of the game, Trevoh Chalobah should have made it 1-0, only for the defender to sky his shot from six yards.

Substitute Estevao Willian provided a much-needed spark for the west London outfit, but Chelsea still found it very difficult to break down a well-organised Palace side. In the game's dying embers, Community Shield winners Palace looked the most likely to break the deadlock, with Eze unleashing a drive that stung the hands of Sanchez.

Liam Delap had half a chance to grab a late winner, but his effort was easily handled by 'keeper Dean Henderson, and soon after, fellow substituteAndre Santos spurned a big chance, too.

In the end, both teams settled for a point, but Enzo Maresca's team need to improve a great deal if they are to be considered as Premier League title challengers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VALENCIA, Spain - Japan attacker Takefusa Kubo began the World Cup season with a bang on Saturday after grabbing a goal in the Spanish La Liga opener, helping Real Sociedad secure a 1-1 draw at Valencia. "My feel for the ball was somewhat not good (in the game), but it's positive to start with a goal," Kubo said. "There were lots of games I felt good playing but went without scoring last year, so I believe it's not a bad thing if I were to continue to have games like this." Diego Lopez had thrown his body to poke home a long ball from deep to give Valencia the lead only three minutes earlier. Kubo provided an instant response with his goal, creating space for himself off a Brais Mendez layoff before finding the net with a crisp strike. "I had my mind set on taking a shot but taking that tiny touch threw both the defender and goalkeeper off their timing. Sociedad are looking to improve on their 11th-place finish last term with Kubo, linked with a transfer away after the club sold many of their key players in recent years, seen as a focal point under new manager Sergio Francisco. "I think it'd be best to build confidence (at Sociedad) and head into the World Cup in good shape, reaching my peak condition there." In the Netherlands, Ayase Ueda headed in a 22nd-minute leveler off a rebound as Feyenoord came from behind to win 2-1 at Excelsior, getting on the scoresheet for the second straight game. Kento Shiogai came on to net a late brace as NEC Nijmegen claimed a 4-1 comeback win at Heracles.</p>

It has been more than five years since Josh Sargent has scored a goal for the United States men's national team. Sargent has now scored goals in three consecutive matches to start the season for Norwich City. After Antonee Robinson and Christian Pulisic, Sargent is arguably the best-performing American for his club, and when looking at the 62 goals that he has scored for Werder Bremen and Norwich City, that is 10 more than Pulisic's 52 goals in that same span of time. Even looking around the Championship, since the beginning of 2024, only Joel Piroe, Josh Brownhill, and Borja Sainz have scored more goals than Sargent's 17. With the national team, though, it hasn't translated, and the question is beginning to shift from will Sargent's scoring translate to the national team to why it isn't being prioritized. Folarin Balogun, Patrick Agyemang, Ricardo Pepi, and Brian White have received the majority of starts under USA coach Mauricio Pochettino during his tenure so far, while Sargent has been left at home. He has expressed that he wants to shine in a USMNT shirt, and Sargent also has a style that fits well with Pulisic in the attack. Bringing plenty to a game, even when he's not scoring, he is being a menace while pressing and providing a strong aerial presence that works when his back is to the goal. That bore fruit when Sargent played with Borja Sainz at Norwich as alongside an inside forward on the left, Sargent can add assists to his goals. If he's selected to face South Korea and Japan next month, it'll be another opportunity for Sargent to show what he can do, but the onus shouldn't just be on him. When looking at why a player's form from a club doesn't translate into the national team, sometimes it's about their specific performance, but other times, they warrant a change of the system to accommodate the player. With Sargent being one of the best American goal scorers over the past few years, there's no reason why Pochettino can't figure out what he has in a position of need.
