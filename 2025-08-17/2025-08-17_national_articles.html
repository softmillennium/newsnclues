                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday met with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, who announced that European and NATO leaders will join the summit.

President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One as he arrives at Joint Base Andrews, Md., early Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025, from a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. NEW YORK (AP) — Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump that the United States and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the war, a U.S. official said Sunday. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, who took part in the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, said it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called it “game-changing.” Witkoff offered few details on how such an arrangement would work. It was expected to be a key topic Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and major European leaders meet with Trump at the White House to discuss ending the 3 1/2-year conflict. Article 5, the heart of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance, says an armed attack against a member nation is considered an attack against them all. What needed to be hammered out at this week's talks were the contours of any security guarantees, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also participated in the summit. “How that's constructed, what we call it, how it's built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that's what we'll be talking about over the next few days with our partners,” Rubio said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” It was unclear, however, whether Trump had fully committed to such a guarantee. The comments shed new light on what was discussed in Alaska. Before Sunday, U.S. officials had offered few details even as both Trump and Putin said their meeting was a success. Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty.” “The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that would prevent them from — or that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels alongside Zelenskyy, applauded the news from the White House as a European coalition looks to set up a force to police any future peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. for signaling that it was willing to support such guarantees but said much remained unclear. “There are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do — and this is our main task: We need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO,” he said. French President Emmanuel Macron said the substance of security guarantees to secure any peace arrangement will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label. At the White House meeting, Macron said European leaders will ask the U.S. to back their plans to beef up Ukraine's armed forces with more training and equipment and deploy an allied force away from the front lines. “We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. Rubio, appearing on several TV news shows Sunday, said it would have been impossible to reach any truce Friday because Ukraine was not there. “Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.” “We're not at the precipice of a peace agreement. Among the issues expected to dominate Monday's meeting: What concessions Zelenskyy might accept on territory. It was unclear among those briefed whether Trump sees that as acceptable. Witkoff said the Russians have made clear they want territory as determined by legal boundaries instead of the front lines where territory has been seized. And that discussion is going to specifically be detailed on Monday,” he said. Zelenskyy has rejected Putin's demands that Ukraine give up the Donbas region, which Russia has failed to take completely, as a condition for peace. In Brussels, the Ukrainian leader said any talks involving land must be based on current front lines, suggesting he will not abandon land that Russia has not taken.</p>

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sunday, Aug. 17, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — European and NATO leaders announced Sunday they will join President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington to present a united front in talks with President Donald Trump on ending Russia's war in Ukraine and firming up U.S. security guarantees now on the negotiating table. Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Finland are rallying around the Ukrainian president after his exclusion from Trump's summit on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Their pledge to be at Zelenskyy's side at the White House on Monday is an apparent effort to ensure the meeting goes better than the last one in February, when Trump berated Zelenskyy in a heated Oval Office encounter. Putin agreed at his summit in Alaska with Trump that the U.S. and its European allies could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union.” The European-drafted plans also envision an allied force in Ukraine away from the front lines to reassure Kyiv that peace will hold and to dissuade another Russian invasion, Macron said. He spoke after a nearly two-hour video call Sunday with nations in Europe and further afield — including Canada, Australia and Japan — that are involved in the so-called “coalition of the willing.” “Otherwise, I think the Ukrainians simply cannot accept commitments that are theoretical.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said earlier at a news conference in Brussels with Zelenskyy that “we welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine. Macron said the substance of security guarantees will be more important than whether they are given an Article 5-type label. Along with Von der Leyen and Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb also said they'll will take part in Monday's talks, as will secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, Mark Rutte. The European leaders' support could help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal. Putin has implied that he sees Europe as a hindrance to negotiations. He has also resisted meeting Zelenskyy in person, saying that such a meeting can only take place once the groundwork for a peace deal has been laid. However, the sheer number of European leaders potentially in attendance means the group will have to be “mindful” not to give “contradictory” messages, Melvin said. “The risk is they look heavy-handed and are ganging up on Trump,” he added. “Trump won't want to be put in a corner.” Although details remain hazy on what Article 5-like security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe would entail for Ukraine, it could mirror NATO membership terms, in which an attack on one member of the alliance is seen as an attack on all. Zelenskyy continues to stress the importance of both U.S. and European involvement in any negotiations. Zelenskyy also pushed back against Trump's assertion — which aligned with Putin's preference — that the two sides should negotiate a complete end to the war, rather than first securing a ceasefire. Zelenskyy said a ceasefire would provide breathing room to review Putin's demands. “It's impossible to do this under the pressure of weapons,” he said. “Putin does not want to stop the killing, but he must do it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The explosion at U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh-area plant has reignited debate about its future. This is the back of the safety helmet worn by a steelworker listening to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's meeting with media at the Clairton Coke Works, a U.S. Steel plant, in Clairton, Pa., Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025. HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The fatal explosion last week at U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh-area coal-processing plant has revived debate about its future just as the iconic American company was emerging from a long period of uncertainty. The fortunes of steelmaking in the U.S. — along with profits, share prices and steel prices — have been buoyed by years of friendly administrations in Washington that slapped tariffs on foreign imports and bolstered the industry's anti-competitive trade cases against China. Most recently, President Donald Trump's administration postponed new hazardous air pollution requirements for the nation's roughly dozen coke plants, like Clairton, and he approved U.S. Steel's nearly $15 billion acquisition by Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel's promised infusion of cash has brought vows that steelmaking will continue in the Mon Valley, a river valley south of Pittsburgh long synonymous with steelmaking. And we wouldn't have done the deal with Nippon Steel if we weren't absolutely sure that we were going to have an enduring future here in the Mon Valley,” David Burritt, U.S. Steel's CEO, told a news conference the day after the explosion. The explosion killed two workers and hospitalized 10 with a blast so powerful that it took hours to find two missing workers beneath charred wreckage and rubble. The explosion now could test Nippon Steel's resolve in propping up the nearly 110-year-old Clairton plant, or at least force it to spend more than it had anticipated. Meanwhile, Burritt said he had talked to top Nippon Steel officials after the explosion and that “this facility and the Mon Valley are here to stay.” U.S. Steel officials maintain that safety is their top priority and that they spend $100 million a year on environmental compliance at Clairton alone. However, repairing Clairton could be expensive, an investigation into the explosion could turn up more problems, and an official from the United Steelworkers union said it's a constant struggle to get U.S. Steel to invest in its plants. Besides that, production at the facility could be affected for some time. Two others are on a reduced production schedule because of the explosion. There is no timeline to get the damaged batteries running again, U.S. Steel said. Accidents are nothing new at Clairton, which heats coal to high temperatures to make coke, a key component in steelmaking, and produces combustible gases as byproducts. The Breathe Project, a public health organization, said U.S. Steel has been forced to pay $57 million in fines and settlements since Jan. 1, 2020, for problems at the Clairton plant. A lawsuit over a Christmas Eve fire at the Clairton plant in 2018 that saturated the area's air for weeks with sulfur dioxide produced a withering assessment of conditions there. The Clairton plant, he wrote, is “inherently dangerous because of the combination of its deficient maintenance and its defective design.” U.S. Steel settled, agreeing to spend millions on upgrades. Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, said U.S. Steel has shown more willingness to spend money on fines, lobbying the government and buying back shares to reward shareholders than making its plants safe. It's not clear whether Nippon Steel will change Clairton. Central to Trump's approval of the acquisition was Nippon Steel's promises to invest $11 billion into U.S. Steel's aging plants and to give the federal government a say in decisions involving domestic steel production, including plant closings. That left workers there uncertain whether they'd have jobs in a couple years and whispering that U.S. Steel couldn't fill openings because nobody believed the jobs would exist much longer. In many ways, U.S. Steel's Mon Valley plants are relics of steelmaking's past. In the early 1970s, U.S. steel production led the world and was at an all-time high, thanks to 62 coke plants that fed 141 blast furnaces. Nobody in the U.S. has built a blast furnace since then, as foreign competition devastated the American steel industry and coal fell out of favor. In the U.S., there are barely a dozen coke plants and blast furnaces left, as the country's steelmaking has shifted to cheaper electric arc furnaces that use electricity, not coal. Blast furnaces won't entirely go away, analysts say, since they produce metals that are preferred by automakers, appliance makers and oil and gas exploration firms. Still, Christopher Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Social and Urban Research, questioned whether the Clairton plant really will survive much longer, given its age and condition. “I'm not quite sure it's all set in stone as people believe,” Briem said.</p>

Former Vice President Mike Pence said he "welcomed" President Donald Trump's actions to combat crime in Washington, D.C., during an interview on CNN, Sunday. Former Vice President Mike Pence said he supported President Donald Trump's action to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C., when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. During an appearance on "State of the Union," Pence was asked what he thought about Trump sending hundreds of National Guard troops to the nation's capital, after Trump faced criticism for how he responded to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. "I am curious what goes through your mind when you see the president aggressively pushing out the National Guard when he didn‘t do so on January 6th, 2021, as the Capitol was under attack, a mob was trying to lynch you and your family was in danger?" Former Vice President Mike Pence and National Guard troops gathering in Washington, D.C. (Getty Images) Pence called January 6 "a tragic day," before praising Trump's efforts to combat crime in the city. He defended the president temporarily taking control of D.C.'s police force as an "important" step to tackle the city's high homicide rate. But I know we did our duty that day, and I wish the president would have done more. But I welcome his decision to deploy the National Guard and essentially federalize the D.C. police department," Pence said. "I know that it‘s all now working in a very cooperative way." U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) conduct a traffic stop near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. "And this is where our national government has to operate, where tens of thousands of people, you included, work every day. I think it's important what the president is doing. And I think the American people welcome the president taking decisive action to ensure the streets of our nation's capital are safe and also continue to provide resources across the country to make all of our cities and towns and communities safe." Top Democrats across the country have pushed back on Trump's actions, claiming that violent crime is at a 30-year-low, a statistic challenged by some law enforcement experts. "Violent crime in Washington, D.C., is at a thirty-year low," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on Monday. "Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the press about deploying federal law enforcement agents in Washington to bolster the local police presence, as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looks on, in the Press Briefing Room at the White House, in Washington D.C., U.S., August 11, 2025. During a press conference on Monday, President Trump claimed the homicide rate in D.C. is higher than that in notoriously violent cities in nations across the world. "The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher," Trump said Monday. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In New Mexico's most populous city, National Guard troops are listening to the police dispatch calls, monitoring traffic cameras and helping to secure crime scene perimeters, tasks not usually part of the job. And last week, New Mexico's governor declared a state of emergency in other parts of the state, which gives her the discretion to mobilize more troops. Here's how a National Guard deployment is playing out in New Mexico and why it matters. The troops are helping police with non-law enforcement duties and are not armed, will not make arrests, detain anyone, use force or engage in any immigration-related activities, the city said. “We understand there are concerns based on what is taking place in other parts of the country, and we want to assure the public that here in Albuquerque, the Guard's role is clearly defined, and focused on support without enforcement,” Police Chief Harold Medina said in a June news release. August 12, 2025: National Guard appears in DC after Trump surges federal authorities “There is no question why the NM National Guard is helping out,” New Mexico National Guard spokesman Hank Minitrez said in a June Facebook post. The post described troops working behind the scenes in police offices, and conducting traffic management and manning perimeters around crime scenes when necessary. Albuquerque officials said last month they saw “success with targeted resources” in the city's downtown. Shootings are down 20% this year compared with 2024, the city said in a news release, a figure that tracks with data provided to CNN by the governor's office. Grisham, a Democrat, criticized President Donald Trump's deployment of 800 troops in Washington, DC, as “executive overreach” and said the contrast “couldn't be clearer” between her state's usage of the National Guard and that of Trump's. Trump has suggested he could do the same in other major Democratic-led cities despite their leaders not asking for help. Meanwhile on the West Coast, questions are still lingering in a court case over the president's deployment of troops to Los Angeles in June as dramatic protests unfolded over immigration enforcement in parts of the city. Grisham's office said the “key difference” between her deployment of troops and Trump's is her order was in response to direct requests from local communities. “While President Trump uses the National Guard to trample local leadership, New Mexico brings together local and state governments to make our communities genuinely safer,” she said. Gavin Newsom called the federal intervention in his state “purposely inflammatory.” Washington, DC, Attorney General Brian Schwalb called the president's actions unnecessary and pointed out violent crime in the district reached 30-year lows last year. Trump said he was going to “look at” taking action in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles because of their crime rates when he announced his plans to take control of DC's police department this week. It is not clear what specifically Trump wants to do in other cities. New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have all seen a sustained decline in crime so far this year, according to a mid-year report from the independent nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice. It's a “dangerous precedent” for the federal government to start deploying troops to deal with local and state policing matters, as they are historically used for crowd control, protecting federal property and federal workers, or responding to a natural disaster, according to Jeffrey Swartz, a former National Guard member and professor emeritus at Cooley Law School. “When the president nationalizes a unit or a state National Guard, they now fall under the Posse Comitatus Act saying they are not allowed to be used for civil policing,” said Swartz. “He cannot authorize federal troops to make arrests. The National Guard can, however, take someone into custody under circumstances where there's a danger to federal property or federal officers, he added. Swartz said National Guardsmen “don't like the idea of being on the streets and being put in a position where they might have to use force against fellow citizens.” “They signed up to protect the country against external threats, not internal ones.”</p>

U.S. Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff claims Russian President Vladimir Putin made "robust" steps toward peace during his meeting with President Donald Trump last week. Witkoff made the statement during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday" with host Shannon Bream. "We agreed on much more robust security guarantees," Witkoff said. "The Russians agreed on enshrining legislatively language that they would attest to not attempting to take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal, where they would attest to not violating any European borders." Witkoff also said Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders directly after the meeting. He said the meeting was "absolutely acknowledged as a win." Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) meets with US President's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff (R) at Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia on August 06, 2025. Bream pressed Witkoff to explain why Trump did not push Putin for a ceasefire agreement during the meeting as well. Trump had previously said a ceasefire was a top priority and claimed Putin would face consequences if he didn't agree to one. "The president has always talked about a ceasefire, until he made a lot of different wins in this meeting and began to realize that we could be talking about a peace deal. The ultimate deal here is a peace deal, and we were talking about much more robust security guarantees than anyone ever imagined," he said. President Donald Trump (R) greets Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) as he arrives at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on August 15, 2025 in Anchorage, Alaska. The leaders said they "welcomed President Trump's efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia's war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace." Putin described his talks with Trump in Alaska as "very frank." Fox News' Landon Mion and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

Ann Marie Lawrence, a Maryland mother and women's weight-loss coach, shares her quick-and-easy recipe for a one-pot Philly cheesesteak pasta dish that contains 32 grams of protein. A frustrated man turned to Reddit after his pregnant sister kept eating his food without asking, leading to an outpouring of support. In a post on the popular platform, the 30-year-old man shared that his 31-year-old sister had recently left her husband and moved in with him. "I have a small apartment, but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she's six months pregnant," he wrote. "I wasn't very pleased about this situation, but she is my sis, after all." At first, things were going fine – until his food started disappearing. The man wrote that he has very specific foods for his fitness goals and that his sister has been eating these — including his expensive shakes, post-run snacks and meal preps. A man described how his sister (not pictured) ate his specially chosen protein shakes and snacks without asking him. "I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. When confronted about her eating habits, the sister responded by shrugging or blaming hormones. "I asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. … She refuses to do anything about it," he said. The brother (not pictured) said he portioned, labeled and planned his groceries each week to support his gym routine. When the man resorted to buying a small mini-fridge and putting it in his bedroom, the sister accused him of "treating her like a thief." "I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights," he said. "Sibling relationships are often the hardest ones we ever deal with." A part of me understands she is going through trouble. After confronting his pregnant sister (not pictured) over food, the man said she blamed hormones and refused to change. Commenters almost unanimously sided with the man. You have got bigger problems than groceries, if she won't even contribute to food costs," one person observed. "Boundaries must be put in place with no apologies." California-based relationship expert Audrey Hope told Fox News Digital the central issue of the disagreement goes far beyond food. "Sibling relationships are often the hardest ones we ever deal with," she noted. "And there [may be] a primal wound that began long ago in childhood that went unnoticed and unhealed." Hope also said that the pregnant sister "was probably pampered" as a child, leading to her entitlement as an adult. Commenters urged the man to set boundaries after his pregnant sister (not pictured) kept helping herself to his groceries. "Boundaries must be put in place with no apologies," she advised. "The sibling with the apartment needs to know that he is being mistreated, and it is time to own his self-esteem and self-love and put up strong boundaries."

President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One as he arrives at Joint Base Andrews, Md., early Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025, from a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy participate in a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Sunday, Aug. 17, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday. Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but that much was unclear. “It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,” he said, “But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees,” he said. Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which Trump had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made. “We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. Rubio, who appeared on three Sunday news shows, said there was not going to be any kind of truce reached because Ukraine was not at the summit. “Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC's “This Week.” “But we're trying to avoid that.” Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, said he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire. He also said “we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement” and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work. “We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off,” Rubio said. Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday. “I think everybody agreed that we had made progress. He added: “The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians -- that could not have been discussed at this meeting” with Putin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three people were killed and another eight were wounded in a mass shooting at a New York City club early Sunday morning. Authorities believe a “dispute” took place involving multiple suspects prior to the shooting. As of Sunday morning, no suspects have been identified or apprehended. The eight other victims, five men and three women, were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. The 11 victims ranged in age from 27 to 61. The shooting comes amid a record low year for gun violence in New York City. “We have the lowest number of shooting incidents and shooting victims seven months into the year that we've seen on record in the city of New York,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters during a brief press conference. During the first seven months of this year, New York City experienced 412 shooting incidents with 489 shooting victims. “Something like this is, of course, thank God, an anomaly, and it's a terrible thing that happened this morning, but we're going to investigate and get to the bottom of what went down,” Tisch said. Officers recovered a firearm near the scene and are trying to determine whether it was used in the shooting.</p>

The alternative to affirmative action is now under attack. President Donald Trump's administration is scrutinizing higher education. Last week, the White House issued a memorandum requiring all universities receiving federal funds to submit admissions data on all applicants to the Department of Education. Days before the memo was released, Columbia and Brown agreed to share their admissions data with the administration, broken down by race, grade point average, and standardized test scores. The Department of Education is expected to build a database of the admissions data and make it available to parents and students. Amid this increased federal scrutiny, an alternative idea from Richard Kahlenberg, director of the American Identity Project for the Progressive Policy Institute, is gaining attention. Kahlenberg, who testified in the Supreme Court cases against Harvard and UNC, advocates for class-based affirmative action instead of race-based admissions. He argues that this approach will yield more economically and racially equitable results. Today, Explained co-host Noel King spoke with Kahlenberg about how he contends with the consequences of helping gut race-based affirmative action, why he believes class-based affirmative action is the path forward, and if his own argument may come in the crosshairs of a Trump administration eager to stamp out all forms of affirmative action. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. I would take it to mean that you are a progressive. I think of myself more as liberal than progressive. I ask because you testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the case Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College. This is the case that essentially gutted race-based affirmative action. I've long been a supporter of racial diversity in colleges. I think that's enormously important, but I've been troubled that elite colleges were racially integrated, but economically segregated. I think there's a better way of creating racial diversity — a more liberal way, if you will — which is to give low-income and economically disadvantaged students of all races a leg up in the admissions process in order to create both racial and economic diversity. Were primarily wealthy Black and Hispanic students benefiting from affirmative action? There'd been a number of studies over the years that had come to that conclusion, including from supporters of race-based affirmative action. Then, in the litigation, further evidence came out. Now, to be clear, the white and Asian students were even richer. Alright, so the Supreme Court in 2023 hands down this decision that says, essentially, we're done with race-based affirmative action. Was there a difference in how progressives and conservatives interpreted the Supreme Court ruling? Most mainstream conservatives have always said they were opposed to racial preferences, but of course, they were for economic affirmative action. That was your team once upon a time, right? Well, I think it's troubling when people shift the goalposts. In a number of the Supreme Court concurring opinions in the case, conservatives said that economic affirmative action made a lot of sense. Justice [Neil] Gorsuch, for example, said if Harvard got rid of legacy preferences and instead gave economic affirmative action, that would be perfectly legal. And now some extremists are shifting their position and saying they're opposed to any kind of affirmative action. But economic affirmative action is broadly supported by the public. The Supreme Court has had two cases come before it, subsequent to the  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision. One involved a challenge to class-based affirmative action at Thomas Jefferson High School in Northern Virginia, and the other involved an attack on a similar class-based affirmative action program at the Boston exam schools, like Boston Latin. In both cases, the Supreme Court said we're not gonna hear those cases over the vehement dissent of a couple of extremely conservative justices. So I'm fairly confident that the Supreme Court will not go down the path of striking down economic-based preferences. What do you make of this move by the Trump administration to ask colleges for data? I do think transparency is good in higher education. These institutions are receiving lots of taxpayer money. We want to make sure they're following the Supreme Court ruling, which said you can't use race. Having said that, I'm quite nervous about how the Trump administration will use the data, because if a college discloses the average SAT scores and grades by race of applicants, of those admitted, and then those enrolled, one of two things can be going on. One is that the university's cheating and they're using racial preferences, and that would be a violation of the law. And so the average SAT score is going to look somewhat lower. I'm worried that the Trump administration will go after both race-based and class-based affirmative action. Because class-based affirmative action still might mean a college is admitting more Black and Hispanic students. As long as the Trump administration was focused on counting race and deciding who gets ahead, they had the American public on their side. But Americans also support the idea of racially integrated student bodies, they just don't like racial preferences as the means for getting there. So, if Trump says, no matter how you achieve this racial diversity, I'm just opposed to racial diversity, he'll have lost the public. And I don't think he will be consistent with the legal framework under Students for Fair Admissions, either. Because under class-based affirmative action, it is true that Black and Hispanic students will disproportionately benefit, but it will also benefit white working-class students. So I think it would be a big mistake if the Trump administration were to really push hard on that angle. Today's trend goes back way further than the modern influencer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kei'Yanii Dawson dreams of attending a historically Black college where she can take classes and engage in campus life with more students who look like her. But Dawson, a junior at a majority-White private high school in San Francisco, said that would likely mean going to school far from home and taking on more debt for housing and out-of-state tuition. However, a growing movement to expand the presence of HBCUs into more communities outside the South could soon give students like Dawson easier access to a Black college. “I feel like if there was a satellite (HBCU) here in San Francisco, it would just be so much easier,” Dawson said. Advocates for HBCUs insist these proposals are critical as the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion programs at predominantly White institutions, such as Harvard University, and as Black students seek schools where they feel included and celebrated. President Donald Trump has decried DEI initiatives as “illegal and immoral discrimination.” Earlier this year, the Trump administration proposed a 2026 fiscal year budget that would cut $64 million in funding for Howard University, the nation's only federally chartered HBCU. The National Institutes of Health also canceled a $16.3 million grant for Florida A&M University's pharmacy school as part of Trump's effort to end DEI programs. Despite his administration's attacks on DEI, Trump signed an executive order in April supporting HBCUs. During this period, HBCUs became the primary means of providing a college education to Black people. Keith Lezama, CEO and founder of Building Bridges Education — a nonprofit dedicated to providing New England students with access and pathways to HBCUs — said he supports the expansion of Black colleges. He said many Black families in communities without HBCUs are not aware of their impact. To know many of these institutions do this without the same resources (as predominantly White colleges), is something that can be seen as a national model of what excellence looks like in education.” HBCUs, Worrell said, are known for producing a higher percentage of low-income, first-generation Black college graduates than majority-White institutions. “If we are serious about building a diverse workforce here in Boston in tech, health care, education, government, then we need to be just as serious about the pipelines that people get here,” Worrell said. Worrell said it is not yet clear if or when the HBCU would open in Boston, and officials have not yet decided which school the city will partner with. Worrell will consider their feedback in his proposal for the school. Officials from Huston-Tillotson University, a small private HBCU in Austin, Texas, say they are also working to establish an off-campus instructional site in San Diego. “Our partners are looking at ways to increase access to and completion of college degrees among underrepresented minority students by providing them with meaningful HBCU experiences,” Beverly Downing, associate provost at Huston-Tillotson University, said in a statement. Downing said there is growing interest among students and families in expanding the school to California. “We started getting a lot of calls and getting requests for a presence there so that the students would have a choice of whether to come out to Texas or to take courses (in California),” Downing said. In San Francisco, officials are also in active discussions about bringing an HBCU satellite campus to the city, Charles Lutvak, spokesperson for Mayor Daniel Lurie, said. Lutvak said he was unable to provide details on a timeline or which Black colleges are in discussions with city leaders. The conversations follow the city's launch of the Black 2 San Francisco initiative last year, which seeks to “create a satellite campus partnership with several HBCUs, including a physical location in San Francisco, and a full suite of academic and professional programming.” Williams said HBCUs have higher retention and graduation rates among Black students. Black students can also experience a sense of belonging and culture at HBCUs that they may not find at predominantly White institutions, where DEI and affirmative action are under attack, Williams said. “Being in a place where you are wanted, that's the key,” he said. “You want to attend an HBCU, then move to a city where the school history and culture already exist,” one user posted on X. “One of the lures of HBCUs is the historical part and putting a satellite campus somewhere random disconnects that,” another user posted on X. Brandon Graham, founder and CEO of Our HBCUs Matter Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to educational programming for high school and HBCU students, said he believes it will be challenging for satellite campuses to replicate the connections and experiences students receive on an HBCU's main campus. However, he said there are creative ways to achieve this. HBCUs must “ensure that you cultivate programmatic models and bring in alumni for those folks who are local to then be able to share and cultivate that synergy that you initially get on an HBCU campus,” said Graham, a graduate of both Clark Atlanta University and Tennessee State University. Graham said he is confident that HBCUs have the connections and resources to expand their reach to communities across the country, just as predominantly White institutions have done. “This next level of satellite campuses is going to diversify and transform the way an HBCU education can be provided.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greg Iles, the Mississippi author of the “Natchez Burning” trilogy and other works, has died. Iles died Friday after a decades-long battle with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, his literary agent Dan Conaway posted Saturday on Facebook. Initially diagnosed with the incurable condition in 1996, he kept his illness private until completing his final novel, “Southern Man,” which was published in 2024. Iles was born in Germany but moved to Natchez, Mississippi, with his family when he was just three years old and developed a deep connection with the region. Many of his stories are set in Mississippi, including the “Natchez Burning” trilogy, historical fiction suspense novels exploring race and class in the 1960s Jim Crow South. Conaway described Iles as “warm, funny, fearless, and completely sui generis.” “To be on the other end of the phone as he talked through character and plot, problem-solving on the fly, was to be witness to genius at work, plain and simple,” he wrote on Saturday. “As a writer he fused story-craft, bone-deep humanity, and a growing sense of moral and political responsibility with the ferocious precisions of a whirling dervish or a master watchmaker.” In March 2011, Iles suffered a ruptured aorta and a partial leg amputation and spent eight days in a medically induced coma after another driver struck his car on Highway 61 near Natchez. Iles performed with the musical group The Rock Bottom Remainders along with popular authors Stephen King, Amy Tan and others.</p>
