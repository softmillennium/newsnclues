                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Tampere University and their collaborators from Germany and India have experimentally confirmed that angular momentum is conserved when a single photon is converted into a pair - validating a key principle of physics at the quantum level for the first time. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for creating complex quantum states useful in computing, communication, and sensing. A simple example is that of colliding billiard balls, where the motion - and with it, their linear momentum - is transferred from one ball to another.A similar conservation rule also exists for rotating objects, which have angular momentum. In the quantum realm, this implies that single particles of light, so-called photons, have well-defined quanta of OAM, which need to be conserved in light-matter interactions. In a recent study in Physical Review Letters, researchers from Tampere University and their collaborators, have now pushed the test of these conservation laws to absolute quantum limit. The conservation rule dictates, e.g., that when a photon with zero OAM is split into two photons, the OAM quanta of both photons must add to zero. Hence, if one of the newly generated photons is found to have one OAM quanta, its partner photon must have the opposite, i.e., negative OAM quanta. Or in other words, the simple formula 1 + (-1) = 0 needs to hold. An extremely stable optical setup, low background noise, a detections scheme with the highest possible efficiency, and a lot of experimental endurance enabled the researchers to record enough successful conversions such that they could confirm the fundamental conservation law. "This work is not only of fundamental importance, but it also takes us a significant step closer to generating novel quantum states, where the photons are entangled in all possible ways, i.e., in space, time, and polarization," adds Prof. Robert Fickler, who leads the Experimental Quantum Optics group where the experiment was performed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This breakthrough can make quantum computers significantly more resilient - paving the way for them to be robust enough to tackle quantum calculations in practice. There, particles adhere to the laws of quantum physics, which means they can exist in multiple states simultaneously and influence each other in ways that are not possible within classical physics. These peculiar but powerful phenomena hold the key to quantum computing and quantum computers, which have the potential to solve problems that no conventional supercomputer can handle today. But before quantum calculations can benefit society in practice, physicists need to solve a major challenge. Qubits, the basic units of a quantum computer, are extremely delicate. The slightest change in temperature, magnetic field, or even microscopic vibrations causes the qubits to lose their quantum states - and thus also their ability to perform complex calculations reliably. To solve the problem, researchers in recent years have begun exploring the possibility of creating materials that can provide better protection against these types of disturbances and noise in their fundamental structure - their topology. However, the challenge remains to find materials that naturally support such robust quantum states. It can contribute to the development of quantum computers robust enough to tackle quantum calculations in practice," says Guangze Chen, postdoctoral researcher in applied quantum physics at Chalmers and lead author of the study published in Physical Review Letters. The search for such materials, with special resilient properties, has been a long-standing challenge. Traditionally, researchers have followed a well-established 'recipe' based on spin-orbit coupling, a quantum interaction that links the electron's spin to its movement orbit around the atomic nucleus to create topological excitations. However, this 'ingredient' is relatively rare, and the method can therefore only be used on a limited number of materials. "The advantage of our method is that magnetism exists naturally in many materials. You can compare it to baking with everyday ingredients rather than using rare spices," explains Guangze Chen. "This means that we can now search for topological properties in a much broader spectrum of materials, including those that have previously been overlooked." The tool can directly calculate how strongly a material exhibits topological behaviour. "Our hope is that this approach can help guide the discovery of many more exotic materials," says Guangze Chen. "Ultimately, this can lead to next-generation quantum computer platforms, built on materials that are naturally resistant to the kind of disturbances that plague current systems."

Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future. This article was published in Scientific American's former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American Drop this image (right) on someone's desk and chances are they'll reflexively blurt, “Joy Division.” The band's 1979 Unknown Pleasures album cover leaned entirely on a small mysterious data display, printed in white on black. An interesting move for a debut studio album. The cover image became an icon but remained mysterious. Even as knowledge spread about the band's inspiration point–a preexisting pulsar data visualization (more on this below)–the true origin of that visualization continued to be a bit of a riddle. What follows is an abridged story borne of that obsession, starting with a video screened at a data visualization conference and ending with an interview with Harold (Hal) Craft, the radio astronomer who created the plot from data collected at the Arecibo Radio Observatory.

VISUALIZED conference attendees were treated to a screening of Data Visualization, Reinterpreted: The Story of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures Album (directed by Eric Klotz and Volkert Besseling). As Saville explains, the cover is directly linked to a figure in The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy (1977 edition)–a stacked plot of radio signals from a pulsar. I'm far from a music and album art expert but visualizing astronomical phenomena is part of my job description. Although I jotted down notes, my intention to look further into things faded. Then, nearly two years later, when chatting with artist Philippe Decrauzat about his influences, my jaw hit the floor. His collection of favorite 1960s and 1970s Scientific American graphics included the stacked plot. It had been printed as a full-page figure in the January 1971 issue; white radio pulses on a field of cyan. My interest was piqued anew, to say the least. When folks refer to the Unknown Pleasures cover, they generally just say that it shows a series of radio frequency periods from the first pulsar discovered. First, a short pulsar primer (keep an eye on this blog in the coming months for a more in-depth discussion on the history of pulsar visualization and explanatory graphics). “[Radio pulsars] are thought to be rotating neutron stars: huge, spinning ‘nuclei' that contain some 1057 protons and neutrons…. Currents of protons and electrons moving within the star generate a magnetic field. That honor goes to Jocelyn Bell Burnell from the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, England, as published in Nature on February 24, 1968. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.) Adam Capriola has documented his search with regular updates, and notes three key pre-album occurrences of the figure. I checked out those three artifacts to see if they would lead to more information about the creator of the plot and/or its significance. The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy, edited by Simon Mitton. No source credit for the plot can be found in the text, other than a general book-wide “diagrams and graphs by Michael Robinson” nod. There's a great four-page summary about pulsars and several diagrams but not much detail about the stacked plot itself, beyond the figure caption. “Successive pulses from the first pulsar discovered, CP 1919, are here superimposed vertically. They are caused by rapidly spinning neutron star.” Included in a catalogue of data visualizations on scientific topics, attributed on the credits page to the Arecibo Radio Observatory. Die Durchschnittsbreite der Pulse ist weniger als eine 50tausendstel-Sekunde. Das Diagramm wurde vom Arecibo Radio-Observatorium in Puerto Rico hergestellt. Aus Scientific American, 'The Nature of Pulsars,' von J. P. Ostriker (U.S.A.).” From Graphis Diagrams: The Graphic Visualization of Abstract Data “The Nature of Pulsars” by Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scientific American, January 1971 (pages 48-60); Credited to Arecibo Radio Observatory in the issue's illustration credit box on page 4. I'm clearly biased, but this article provides a neat and accessible view into the early days of pulsar data collection and theory (particularly when paired with “Pulsars,” by Antony Hewish, Scientific American, October 1968). “EIGHTY SUCCESSIVE PERIODS of the first pulsar observed, CP1919 (Cambridge pulsar at 19 hours 19 minutes right ascension), are stacked on top of one another using the average period of 1.33730 seconds in this computer-generated illustration produced at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico. The average pulse width is less than 50 thousandths of a second.” From “The Nature of Pulsars,” by Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scientific American, January 1971. By now I had also combed through early discovery articles in scientific journals and every book anthology on pulsars I could get my hands on to learn more about early pulsar visualizations. A transition in technology from analogue to digital seemed to have been taking place between the discovery of pulsars in 1967 to the work being conducting at Arecibo in 1968 through the early 1970′s. A cohort of doctoral students from Cornell University seemed to be embracing that shift, working on the cutting edge of digital analysis and pulsar data output. One PhD thesis title from that group in particular caught my attention, “Radio Observations of the Pulse Profiles and Dispersion Measures of Twelve Pulsars,” by Harold D. Craft, Jr. (September 1970). Sure enough, there was the image in Craft's thesis, along with two other stacked plots. On February 16, 2015, I sat down with Craft just outside of Ithaca, N.Y., and asked him about his recollections of Arecibo, the data visualizations in his thesis and the Unknown Pleasures album cover. And I, at the time, was doing radiometric temperature measurements of the surface of Venus, which didn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. I was working also on a new design for the line feeds for Arecibo, and that also didn't seem to be going anywhere. It also had the rudiments of digital technology there, because it was a radar observatory, and the radar folks were using digital technology. Radio astronomy folks, including myself at the time, were primarily using – would you believe it – chart recorders, or very slow analogue to digital converters. So anyway, the instrumentation was all set up to make measurements on these things, and so a number of us turned immediately, saying, “hey, you know, this looks like an interesting thing to do.” Besides, Frank Drake encouraged us to focus on these, obviously a major scientific issue at the time, which we did. So all four of us focused on these, in different ways. But, here's something new in astronomy that hadn't been seen before, and we were at the best instrument in the world to look at them, and what better opportunity was there than that? Craft on stacked pulsar plots, leading up to the CP 1919 data visualization: This plotting of sequences like this, it started just a little bit earlier when we were looking at potentially drifting subpulses within the major pulse itself. So, then the thought was, well let's plot out a whole array of pulses, and see if we can see particular patterns in there. So that's why, this one was the first I did – CP1919 – and you can pick out patterns in there if you really work at it. So then, I wrote the program so that I would block out when a hill here was high enough, then the stuff behind it would stay hidden. And it was pretty easy to do from a computer perspective. I also wrote a program that, instead of having these lined up vertically like this, I tilted them off at a slight angle like that so that it would look like you were looking up a hillside – which was aesthetically interesting and pleasing, but on the other hand, it just confused the whole issue. Craft on preparing the original computer plots for thesis publication: So what happened, just in the process of putting together the thesis, I would give this [see image below] to a woman draftsperson in the space sciences building at Cornell, and she would then trace this stuff with india ink, and make a much darker image of it, so that it could be printed basically. In fact, I didn't know anything about it, and a colleague in the space sciences department, who is now a professor of astronomy at Cornell, Jim Cordes, saw me on the street – he's been a long time friend – and he said, “oh, by the way, did you know that your image is on the cover of Joy Division?” And, I said no, I had no clue. So I went to the record store and, son of a gun, there it was. So I bought an album, and then there was a poster that I had of it, so I bought one of those too, just for no particular reason, except that it's my image, and I ought to have a copy of it. Subsequently she moved to Washington, D.C., to join the staff of National Geographic (first as an assistant art director–researcher hybrid and then as a designer), spent four years as a freelance science communicator and returned to Scientific American in 2007. Christiansen presents and writes on topics ranging from reconciling her love for art and science to her quest to learn more about the pulsar chart on the cover of Joy Division's album Unknown Pleasures. in geology and studio art from Smith College.</p>
