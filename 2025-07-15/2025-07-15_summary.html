Protests this month laid bare the growing anger from locals against foreigners who have flocked to the Mexican capital since the coronavirus pandemic

The protesters tore through the city chanting angry slogans and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake: shattered glass, broken doors and furious graffiti – “get out of Mexico.”

Some, dressed in black, smashed windows of local businesses. Others marched peacefully but carried signs with angry messages: “You're a colonizer not a fucking ‘expat'”; “Gringo go home.”

The march, which took place in central Mexico City earlier this month, was an angry local response against a growing global phenomenon: Gentrification, which locals blame on foreigners who have flocked to the capital since the coronavirus pandemic.

Residents of the capital say these so-called ‘digital nomads' are taking advantage of Mexico's relatively cheap living standards but pricing out locals in the process.

Making matters worse: a flood of Airbnbs have overtaken the metropolis' most desirable, central neighborhoods (more than 26,000 listings according to the Inside Airbnb advocacy group), replacing longtime residents with tourists and short-term renters.

It is a trend that's been echoed around the world, in cites like Barcelona, Genoa and Lisbon, where tourist apartments have proliferated, turning long-term residents into a rarity and causing anger among locals who have seen their communities eroded.

The protest prompted a sharp rebuke from the country's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. “The xenophobic displays at this demonstration must be condemned,” she said during a daily news conference last week. “No matter how legitimate the demand, in this case gentrification, we can't just say ‘Out!' to any nationality in our country.”

But many Mexicans were sympathetic to the marchers' anger. Watching the protest play out on social media from his mother's home in the nearby city of Puebla, where he was forced to move after being priced out of Mexico City, Daniel Benavides says all he could think was: “Hell yeah!”

A 35-year-old film editor, Benavides moved to the Roma Sur neighborhood in central Mexico City in 2016. Unlike the already trendy Roma Norte and Condesa, Roma Sur still felt like a quiet neighborhood, without the hip bars, restaurants and Airbnbs that had flooded other areas. It was also affordable.

But slowly, things started to change. There was already one Starbucks – then another one appeared, followed by the American fast food restaurant Popeyes. Then came the quaint cafes and bars that all looked the same.

“They all had little incandescent lightbulbs held up by rope,” he said.

Benavides also started to notice an influx of foreigners, mostly Americans.

Soon, the rent for his apartment started to go up. First the landlord increased the apartment's monthly rent by 3000 pesos (£118) from one year to the next. Then he started increasing it by about 8% annually. Before long it had gone from 15,500 to 20,500 pesos per month (£613 to £810).

Such an increase is relatively modest, particularly by Mexico City standards. Yahir Zavaleta, 40, was living in Roma Norte in 2012, when it was still filled with locally owned businesses and cafes. When his contract came up for renewal in 2014, the rental company wanted to nearly double the rent. Zavaleta and his roommate decided to leave.

Cecilia Portillo, a 30-year-old designer, has lived in Condesa for three years. Recently, she told her landlady that she was moving out, but that a friend was ready to take her place.

“The rent is going to go up by 50%,” said the landlady, according to Portillo, who has also watched a flood of foreigners arrive in her building. “We've seen that people are willing to pay that much.”

Such dramatic price rises, particularly in desirable, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, are common in Mexico City. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2024 found that, over a 20 year period, average housing prices in the Mexican capital had quadrupled, without considering inflation. In the swanky neighborhood of Polanco, prices increased eightfold between 2000 and 2018.

Yet the study's authors cautioned that “the influx of digital nomads, which significantly increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, does not appear to significantly impact the dynamics of housing access” noting that it “may be too early to observe the full impact of these newcomers”.

Instead, the study suggested that “displacement and gentrification predominantly originate from government policies and politics.” According to Mexico's national statistics agency, Mexico City had the lowest rate of new housing built between 2010 and 2020 of any state in the country.

“Housing construction has practically stopped completely in the last seven years,” said Adrián Acevedo, an urban planner and housing specialist. “If there is no housing, then the purchasing power of those few people [who can afford to live in desirable areas], whether it be a foreigner or an upper-class Mexican, will obviously push up the price of the few homes that are available.”

The lack of new housing, and the resulting surge in prices, leaves many lower-income residents with nowhere to go: According to state figures, 23,000 families leave Mexico per year.

In 2022, Benavides' landlord announced that he had sold the apartment to a French woman: Benavides and his roommates would have to move out. He managed to find a shabby place nearby for 14,500 (£574) a month where he lived for a year. But then the landlord said they were increasing the monthly rent by 500 pesos, and Benavides also found himself without a job.

Benavides decided to move out but suddenly found that rental prices in his neighborhood had skyrocketed up to 25, 35, 40 even 100,000 pesos a month. His old place now seemed like a bargain. With no job prospects and rents unaffordable, Benavides decided to leave Mexico City and move back in with his mother.

“I pushed the emergency eject button,” he said woefully, adding that, particularly as a gay man, he still misses the capital. “It's a beacon of hope – a place you can be free.”

LONDON, July 15. /TASS/. Melania Trump could have significantly influenced US President Donald Trump's decision to supply Ukraine with interceptor missiles for Patriot complexes, The Times quoted Mary Jordan, who authored a book about the first lady, as saying.

"Trump listens to certain people on certain things," says Jordan. "He particularly listens to people who are really close to him. And especially if their last name is Trump."

As The Times points out, despite the large number of national security advisers and foreign policy analysts in the White House, it is the wife of the US president whose opinion may be the most significant.

On July 14, Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev, if Europe would pay for such supplies. Coordination was laid on NATO.

CNN reported that besides the Patriot complexes, the United States may also transfer short-range missiles and howitzer ammunition to NATO countries for a subsequent shipment to Ukraine.

On a late March morning in 2024 in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, 24-year-old Yasmin Siam felt sharp pain grip her stomach. Labor had begun. Time was slipping away. But there was no way to get her to a hospital.

Ambulances had become rare after months of Israeli attacks — too few to answer every cry for help. Airstrikes were ongoing, and Gaza had fallen into total immobility. Cars were gone. Fuel was gone. And ambulances, often targeted, had mostly been destroyed or left in flames.

With no other option, Siam's family placed her on a donkey cart — the only remaining form of “transportation” in a time where movement itself had died. The journey to Nasser Hospital, which should have taken 20 minutes, took over an hour due to the wreckage, craters, and collapsed roads across Khan Younis.

By the time she arrived, Siam was bleeding dangerously. Her blood pressure was collapsing. Doctors tried everything they could with the little they had. But then came the words that shattered her: “Your baby didn't make it.”

It was her first child.

The child did not die because of war wounds, but because movement throughout Gaza has been decimated.

Yasmin Siam's heartbreaking story is just one of many amid the widespread crisis gripping Gaza's transportation system. During the temporary ceasefire that lasted about 60 days — from late November 2023 until the end of January 2024 — the displaced residents of northern Gaza, who had fled south and remained trapped far from their destroyed homes for over a year, began to return north. During this period, the Israeli occupation designated specific days for walking and other days for permitting vehicles for Palestinians returning north. But Palestinians couldn't wait; fear of the war restarting consumed them. So, many returned on foot, walking more than 30 kilometers.

Water is scarce in Gaza. We search for it in far-off places, then carry it home through harsh, punishing paths. Even a sip of water has become a journey of pain.

Among them was the family of my uncle Iyad, who had fled to Khan Younis. He told me the story of an elderly man, about 80 years old, who suddenly collapsed while walking — dying on his way back home. He could not bear the long journey and exhaustion; he died before reaching safety. The story was heartbreaking, but I felt that the very attempt to return gave him a small measure of joy after a year of sorrow. For this man, returning home was a dream. Yet, he never made it — his body weaker than his will.

But the most painful story — the one I witnessed with my own eyes and will never forget — happened during the ground siege imposed by Israeli forces in February 2024.

During those terrifying days, we sealed every window shut. No sound. No light. Any sign of life could bring death to everyone in the neighborhood. But at around 7:00 am, I heard a young man crying faintly, “I'm thirsty.” I crept to the window, peeking through a narrow crack. Outside, I saw him — a young man who had been riding his bicycle. A tank had fired on him, and he was struck in the shoulder.

It wasn't a fatal injury. He could have survived. He was lying directly beneath my home, crying out, asking for water. I heard every word. But I didn't — couldn't — move. I knew that stepping outside meant death. Not just for me, but for everyone in the house. I still carry the guilt. I didn't save him, though I could hear him dying. But in my heart, I also knew: during the siege, no ambulances ever came. No rescue was possible. Even the smallest wound became a death sentence.

He kept bleeding for hours, his voice growing weaker… until it vanished. Three days later, after the Israeli army withdrew, neighbors found his body and buried him in the yard of Al-Qahira School in Al-Rimal. There were no proper burials anymore. The cemeteries were full. There was no transport left to reach them. In Gaza, even the act of burying the dead has become a luxury. Schoolyards and hospital courtyards are now our mass graves.

The suffering caused by the absence of transportation doesn't stop — it continues in countless forms. When aid is distributed, it's often near the Netzarim checkpoint, the dividing line between northern and southern Gaza. People from both sides walk more than 15 kilometers just to reach it — on foot. But walking itself requires strength. And who among us still has strength after more than a year and a half of hunger and malnutrition? Imagine someone walking 15 kilometers to reach the aid, then another 15 kilometers back — and often returning with nothing.

Take my father, for example. He has lost over 20 kilograms — not just because of the lack of food, but from the endless walking. When basic supplies become available, he walks and walks to get them and comes back utterly exhausted. And what about the elderly? The ones who carry heavy water containers on their backs because there is no transport to help them? Water is scarce in Gaza. We search for it in far-off places, then carry it home through harsh, punishing paths. Even a sip of water has become a journey of pain.

What we suffer from today is beyond words — even donkey carts are vanishing. The horse-drawn carts disappeared long ago, most of them targeted and destroyed, as if no form of movement should be left to us. The few donkeys that survived are now dying slowly from hunger. Seeing a living animal on Gaza's streets has become rare. On June 28, 2025, I saw it with my own eyes: A donkey had collapsed on the road, too weak to stand, while its owner struggled helplessly to lift it. He tried everything — pulling, calling, pleading — but nothing worked. The animal was simply too frail, too starved to move.

If even our last means of transport collapses in the street, what hope is left for the humans who still need to run?

If even our last means of transport collapses in the street, what hope is left for the humans who still need to run?

Imagine a father running down a silent street in Gaza, his child bleeding in his arms. “Hold on,” he whispers. “We'll get to the hospital.” But there are no cars. No ambulances. Not even a cart. Only the sound of his footsteps — and his son's fading breath. The boy dies — not only from the wound, but from the brutal fact that there was no way to move.

In Gaza, life has died in every form. No homes. No hospitals. No streets. No transport. All that remains are tents — and exhausted bodies slowly dying, silently, in all the ways Gaza teaches us to die.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Trump has benefited for years from a MAGA conspiracy theory alleging that Jeffrey Epstein kept a “client list.”

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

One week after the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document stating that there was never a Jeffrey Epstein “client list” — a supposed list of child sex predators and traffickers that is the center of a conspiracy theory that right-wingers have promoted for years — President Donald Trump, who benefited from that conspiracy theory, has expressed frustration that his MAGA base isn't moving on.

The refusal of Trump's base to believe the DOJ and Attorney General Pam Bondi's newest assessment of the Epstein files is visibly frustrating the president, who has lashed out at his followers on social media and derided reporters for questioning the new narrative.

Believers in the Epstein “client list” conspiracy theory allege that Epstein, a financier and former friend of Trump's, used the list as political leverage against public figures, including liberal and left-leaning individuals. Members of Trump's own administration, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, played a role in spreading the theory prior to assuming their posts.

Trump, who was president when Epstein was arrested and subsequently died in jail, wasn't a direct promoter of the conspiracy theory. But he did discuss it in interviews, including in September 2024, at the height of the presidential campaign season.

“I'd certainly take a look at it,” Trump said in regards to releasing the files relating to Epstein, adding that he'd be “inclined” to release such a list and would have “no problem” with doing so. He also called it “very interesting” that the supposed list had not yet been made public, implying that the Biden administration was purposefully keeping the names hidden.

Earlier this month, however, the DOJ announced that there is no Epstein “client list,” that there was “no credible evidence” of a blackmail conspiracy, and that Epstein indeed died by suicide while in jail, contradicting years of questions regarding the official narrative that Trump had benefited from.

The document is also a stark departure from what Bondi had stated earlier this year. In an interview in February, when asked if an Epstein list would be released, Bondi responded affirmatively, saying it was on her desk waiting for review.

Last week, however, she claimed that her response did not mean that the client list was real — instead, she was referring to files relating to Epstein, she said. 

Since that time, Trump's supporters have taken issue with the DOJ's conclusions, with some revolting against him on social media. Some of Trump's allies in Congress, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), have also expressed skepticism over the administration's new line. 

“I have to be honest, it's just a red line that it crosses for many people,” Greene said in an interview on Monday.

The loyal MAGA base Trump relied on for so many years now appears to be “genuinely fractured,” read an assessment of the situation from Politico published this week.

Days after the DOJ document was released, a reporter asked Bondi to comment during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump, visibly upset over the question, interjected.

“Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable. Do you want to waste the time?” he asked.

A few days later, Trump told his base it was time to move on.

“We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

Trump peddled a new conspiracy theory within that same post, baselessly claiming that several figures (including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and others) had written the Epstein files themselves in an effort to hurt him. 

Let's “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,” Trump added.

Democrats are pouncing on the situation. The Democratic National Committee (DNC), for example, has created a new profile on X to remind viewers daily that the supposed Epstein list hasn't been released.

Tim Hogan, the DNC's senior adviser for messaging, has called for the Trump administration to be more transparent. Said Hogan:

Trump administration officials are either lying about the file and keeping it covered up to protect themselves, or they lied about its existence in a shameless political ploy to get elected. Either way, it is disgusting, and they have to be held accountable.

Democratic lawmakers have also spoken out about the matter.

“Either [Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there! Put up or Shut up,” wrote Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas). 

“Democrats didn't put the Jeffrey Epstein thing into the public domain,” Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said at a press conference on Monday. “This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam Bondi and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several years, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.”

The fracturing of Trump's MAGA base is somewhat evident in recent polls.

According to a new Economist/YouGov poll published Tuesday morning, 79 percent of all U.S. voters want the Epstein files to be publicly released, including 83 percent of voters who backed Trump in 2024. Among those voters, there appears to be skepticism with the Trump administration's handling of the files, with nearly 6 in 10 (59 percent) of them saying the government is covering up evidence.

Trump's approval rating among those who voted for him last year is still high, with 84 percent backing him and 13 percent disapproving. But that's a shift from the start of this summer, when 87 percent of his voters approved of his job performance and only 10 percent didn't — and it's a huge shift from the start of this year, when, in early February, 92 percent of Trump voters approved of his job performance and only 5 percent said they disapproved.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

As a lobbyist, Ken Kies secured tax giveaways for major corporations. Now, he's helping implement the GOP budget bill.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

A corporate lobbyist who for decades has helped major companies and rich Americans dodge taxes is now serving as the U.S. Treasury Department's top tax policy official, a position in which he will write rules implementing the newly passed Republican budget law.

That role is “enormously powerful,” The New York Times' Jesse Drucker wrote in a Monday profile of Ken Kies, whom the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate confirmed as assistant treasury secretary for tax policy in a party-line vote last month. President Donald Trump selected Kies for the position in January.

The Republican budget measure, which President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month, contains around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that will flow disproportionately to the wealthiest Americans over the next decade, according to nonpartisan analysts.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“By putting a professional tax-dodging consultant in charge of their tax law, Republicans are continuing to make their intentions crystal clear — this law is a gift to billionaires and huge corporations like those Ken Kies has spent his career looking out for,” Leor Tal, campaign director for the progressive advocacy group Unrig Our Economy, said in a statement Monday.

“As families struggle with rising prices from Trump's tariffs and face devastating cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Tal added, “Republicans are doubling down on helping the richest of the rich, while working people pay the price.”

In his role as a lobbyist whose client list has included Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Microsoft, and other corporate behemoths, Kies has helped secure major tax giveaways for large companies and wealthy Americans — including in the 2017 Trump-GOP tax law that the new Republican budget package extends.

“In the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kies successfully pushed for legislation to make such offshore tax dodges even easier to execute. During the Obama administration, he fended off another attempted crackdown on those strategies,” Drucker wrote Monday. “In 2017, as part of a sweeping package of tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Kies lobbied for a new tax break that provides a 20% deduction to certain businesses, which overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans.”

Drucker noted that in his new position, Kies “will oversee about 100 attorneys and economists at the Treasury Department's Office of Tax Policy, a powerful corner of the federal government.”

“The office issues regulations to help the government administer tax laws and provides guidance that can render the latest tax-dodging strategy a gold mine — or doom it,” he added.

Kies previously served as managing director of the Federal Policy Group, a lobbying firm at which he “delivered significant legislative and regulatory results for his clients, which include major corporations, trade associations, and coalitions of companies with common objectives,” according to a since-removed biography of Kies.

“Mr. Kies has led coalition efforts to enact legislation responding to the World Trade Organization's ruling against U.S. foreign sales corporation benefits, to avert enactment of broad ‘corporate tax shelter' legislation that would have an adverse impact on legitimate business transactions, and to reverse Treasury regulations targeting ‘hybrid' arrangements of U.S. multinational corporations, among other projects,” the biography stated.

Highlighting the Times profile of Kies, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote Monday that the Trump administration is “wallowing in corruption.”

“Five trillion dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest, written and administered by the wealthiest,” she wrote. “On the backs of stripping healthcare and food from working and poor people. Shame on you.”

In addition to implementing the new Trump-GOP law, Kies could be positioned to help deliver another sizable tax break to the rich.

The Washington Post's Jeff Stein reported last week that on the heels of passage of the GOP budget law, right-wing organizations and Republican lawmakers are set to push the Trump administration to unilaterally “drastically reduce what investors pay on their capital gains.”

“The plan rests on changing how the Treasury Department calculates those taxes,” Stein wrote. “The highest-earning 1% of Americans would receive 86% of the benefits from indexing capital gains to inflation, while the bottom 80% of income earners would get just 1% of the benefits, Penn Wharton projected in 2018.”

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, wrote in response to Stein's reporting that “after gutting health care for millions of Americans and passing massive tax breaks for billionaires, Republicans are now working on even MORE tax breaks for the ultra-rich.”

“They aren't interested in fighting for working families — only their rich friends,” Boyle added.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Fauja Singh, an Indian-born runner nicknamed the Turbaned Torpedo who was believed to be the world's oldest marathon runner, has died after being hit by a car. He was 114.

Local media in India reported that Singh sustained severe head injuries in a hit-and-run accident on Monday while he was crossing the road at his native village near Jalandhar in Punjab. He was taken to the hospital where he later died. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs In The City, confirmed his death.

India's Prime minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh, saying he was “extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness.”

Singh became the oldest man to run a full marathon in 2011 at the age of 100 in Toronto. His accomplishment was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he did not have a birth certificate to prove his age. Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911.

A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on him because of its grisly nature.

Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father's eyes.

Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left all alone.

“He didn't think his life was worth living without his son” following the traumatic incident, his coach Harmander Singh said.

He went to live with his youngest son in London. That's where sports enthusiast Singh attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community and took part in sprints. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided that's what he wanted to do.

At the age of 89 in 2000 he ran the London Marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Marathon.

“From a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,” Singh said.

Singh ran his last competitive race in 2013 at the age of 101, finishing the Hong Kong Marathon's 10-kilometre (6.25-mile) race in 1 hour, 32 minutes, 28 seconds.

Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped “people will remember me and not forget me.” He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events “rather than forget me altogether just because I don't run anymore.”

“He was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination,” Modi said. “Pained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and countless admirers around the world.”

The 76-year-old former SCTV star Dave Thomas recently spoke to The Globe and Mail about his trip to Ukraine.Dave Thomas/The Canadian Press

Comedian Dave Thomas recently returned from a 10-day trip to Ukraine to raise awareness for the Ukrainian Freedom Fund, a charity that supplies non-lethal equipment and training to Ukrainians. The 76-year-old former SCTV star recently spoke to The Globe and Mail by video conference from Los Angeles. 

How does one get to Kyiv in the middle of a war?

You can't fly to Ukraine. I took a Turkish Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, which took 14 hours. And then I took a connecting flight to Chisinau, Moldova, south of Ukraine. From there was an eight-hour ride with an army security official through Ukraine. It was a pretty hairy ride.

Were you in danger?

We were dodging automobile debris on the road, from previous drone strikes. We had to travel at night because the strikes were during the day. I later met a communications officer who said his personal car was attacked when he was off duty. They were stalking him because he was a valuable piece in the military command chain. The Russians use social media and all sorts of tracking methods. It's a different kind of war going on. 

What was Kyiv like?

We got there in the morning. It looked like a normal European city − business as usual. People sat in cafes drinking lattes. Students were lined up outside the university. During the day, it was difficult for me to imagine there was a war going on. But at night, that's when you know. Explosions rocked my hotel.

Do you meet any Canadians over there?

I did, a retired Canadian general acting as an adviser. There are more than a million Ukrainians in Canada. This general felt he was doing the right thing by them. There's a sense of obligation to them, as taxpaying citizens. 

You're a comedian with no Ukrainian heritage in your background. What about your own sense of responsibility that led your there?

I'm 76 years old. I feel I have to do something with my life before I die that has some value. I've made some people laugh. I guess that's great. But I felt I should do something more.

Former SCTV star Dave Thomas goes to Ukraine: ‘Most of my career is behind me, so why don't I go over there and see what I can do?'

What do you think you accomplished?

I learned a lot about people. Maybe there will be an increase in donations in Canada, which would be great. They're giving medical supplies and teaching field triage. They have evacuation teams that go behind enemy lines to rescue Ukrainian people who are trapped there, including women and children. 

Did you accompany those teams?

I did. The Russians were shooting at us. 

On SCTV, you portrayed Bob Hope, famous for entertaining troops abroad. I wonder if he ever got shot at.

I don't know. But drones are the weapons of choice now. Ukrainian soldiers told me how difficult they are to shoot down. They're almost like those model airplanes hobbyists fly. I saw one Russian drone hanging in a bar. It doesn't look threatening at all, and yet they carry ordnance. 

Did you talk to wounded soldiers?

Yes. The communications officer I mentioned lost his legs. He said to me, ‘They blew up the wrong half of me.' He's still good from the legs up. ‘I'm still fighting,' he said. 

What about the civilians you spoke with?

I talked to a woman who was being evacuated from the south, near Odessa. Her husband was packing the car, and a Russian sniper shot him in the head. She saw it happen from the window of her house. She fled with her children on her own. Nobody should have to witness that.

Did you speak with people about President Trump and U.S. support?

They're very careful not to say anything negative about the United States. There's a Ukrainian phrase that translates to, ‘Everything will be fine.' There's a song that everybody knows that talks to this spirit of resilience. I saw that resilience myself.

In what form?

I heard about drone strikes on a mall in Kyiv. It happened around midnight. When I went to the mall the next morning, the store owners had replaced the glass that had been destroyed by the blast. Cardboard replaced the walls, and they were open for business as usual. I have to admit, I was mad at myself for being disappointed, because I brought my video crew to shoot the devastation and it was already under repair. They're dedicated to making things appear normal.

You had plans to visit comedy clubs. Did you?

Yes. I spoke with stand-ups. I wanted to know what Ukrainians were laughing at. What I found was that it wasn't Trump or Putin or political jokes. It's dating, lifestyle stuff. They want to laugh at normal things. The war is off topic. Nobody thinks the war is funny − there's nothing funny about it.

Singh's east London running club confirms death in India of athlete thought to be first centenarian to run a marathon

The runner Fauja Singh, believed to be the oldest person to complete a marathon, has died in a road accident in India aged 114.

The athlete, who lived in Ilford in east London, was hit by a car and suffered fatal injuries while trying to cross a road in his birth village of Beas Pind, near Jalandhar in Punjab, on Monday, according to reports in India.

His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs in the City, confirmed his death and said its upcoming events in Ilford would be a celebration of his life and achievements.

Singh's coach, Harmander Singh, wrote on Facebook: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm our icon of humanity and powerhouse of positivity Fauja Singh has passed away in India. Aged 114 years old.

“He succumbed to injuries caused by a vehicle accident while crossing the road close to his home.”

Singh made his name by beating a number of records for marathon times in different age brackets. The centenarian became an inspiration for countless athletes by running marathons past the age of 100.

A profile on the Olympics website said Singh was born in Punjab, then under British rule, on 1 April 1911 and was the youngest of four children in a farming family. He moved to England and settled in east London with his son after the death of his wife, Gian Kaur, in Jalandhar.

It was not until 2000, aged 89, that he took up running, quickly rising to fame by completing his maiden marathon in London in six hours and 54 minutes. This time knocked 58 minutes off the previous world's best in the 90-plus age bracket.

Singh ran numerous marathons, completing the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon in five hours and 40 minutes, his personal best. On 16 October 2011 in Toronto, he is thought to have become the first centenarian to run a marathon.

The MP Preet Kaur Gill said on X: “Saddened to hear about the passing of Fauja Singh. I had the honour of meeting him. A truly inspiring man. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me.

“A reminder that age is just a number, but attitude is everything. Rest in power, legend.”

Her fellow Labour MP Jas Athwal, who represents Ilford South, said on X: “Deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Sardar Fauja Singh Ji. He was legendary – a man who continued running until he was 101. He was a global Sikh icon, that inspired millions across the world.

“His spirit and legacy of resilience will run on forever. My heartfelt condolences to all his family and friends. We will miss him.”

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. Moscow will not be dictated to, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS, commenting on recent statements by US President Donald Trump.

"Certainly, above all, we note that any attempts to put forth demands or, moreover, ultimatums, are unacceptable to us," the senior Russian diplomat pointed out.

He emphasized that Moscow favors a diplomatic resolution of the Ukraine conflict and is ready to negotiate. "It is necessary to focus on political and diplomatic work. The president of the Russian Federation has repeatedly said that we are ready to negotiate and that the diplomatic path is the one we prefer," Ryabkov noted.

"However, if this is not met with a proper response, if we cannot reach our set goals through diplomacy, then the special military operation will go on," the Russian deputy foreign minister cautioned.

Moscow is "unshakable" in this stance, he highlighted. "We would like for Washington and NATO in general to treat it with the utmost seriousness," Ryabkov said.

In his assessment, Trump's recent statements "fit in with the general line we have been seeing from the US side lately."

On July 14, Trump made a scheduled statement on the Ukrainian settlement. In the presence of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the US leader said that he was "disappointed" in Russia and its president as well as announced his decision to continue supplying weapons and military hardware to the Kiev regime if Europe foots the bill with NATO coordination.

Additionally, Trump said that the US will impose about 100% import tariffs on Russia and its trade partners if within 50 days Moscow and Washington do not reach an agreement on the Ukrainian settlement.

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. The Kremlin has taken note of US President Donald Trump's statement on Monday about military aid supplies to Kiev and will thoroughly analyze his rhetoric, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing.

"The latest statements from the US president are very serious. Something in them concerns President [Vladimir] Putin personally," Peskov said. "We will certainly need time to analyze the rhetoric from Washington," he added.

On July 14, Trump revealed his statement on resolving the Ukraine conflict. At a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the US leader said he was "disappointed" with Russia and personally President Vladimir Putin. He also announced sending more US weapons and military aid to Kiev to be purchased by European nations with coordination from NATO.

The US president also threatened "tariffs of about 100%" against Russia and its trade partners "if we don't have a deal in 50 days."

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump lashes out at Moscow, and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky reshuffles his cabinet. Meanwhile, the EU is struggling to agree on an 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions. These stories topped newspaper headlines across Russia on Tuesday.

 

The latest US restrictions on Russia pledged by President Donald Trump in the event of a lack of progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict cannot harm the Russian economy: even 100% tariffs will be of no use amid a record low bilateral trade. As for more sanctions, most essential goods have long been manufactured in Russia or imported via countries not subject to US restrictions, the State Duma explained to Izvestia. Meanwhile, new weapons supplies, including Patriot systems, will not be a gamechanger on the battlefield. Experts doubt US-made Patriots are a superweapon and believe that most threats will likely remain mere rhetoric.

On Monday, the US leader voiced his claims against Russia and proposed both military and economic measures that he thinks should pressure Russia to end the Ukraine conflict. At a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on July 14, Trump announced sending more US weapons to be purchased by European nations. Among other weapons, the deal would see Kiev receive 17 Patriot batteries within the next few days.

"Strange that someone still views the notorious Patriot systems as superweapons, even as we have repeatedly destroyed these US [missile] systems in Ukraine, too, — our Kinzhal [missiles] pierce them easily. And the S-400 Triumf missile system is in service with our army, which has better tactical and technical characteristics than US systems," State Duma Deputy and First Deputy Chairman of the Defense Committee Alexey Zhuravlev told Izvestia.

According to him, Moscow may respond in kind to the US move, by sending the S-400 Triumf system to Iran, which has proven to need constant protection from Western missiles, or Yemen's Houthis who have learned to down US aerial targets using improvised weapons. "I mean, it may take two to play this weapons supply game," the politician concluded.

Apart from military measures, Trump proposed increasing economic pressure on Russia as well, "if we don't have a deal in 50 days." He threatened "tariffs at about 100%" against Moscow and its trade partners.

Such lofty tariffs may look scary, but last year, trade between Russia and the United States amounted to some $3.5 billion — quite a small volume for both countries, Daniil Bolotskikh, an analyst with BCS World of Investments, noted. This is perhaps why Trump might have actually meant sanctions, not tariffs, he said. By the way, last year, Russia-US trade hit a record low since 1992, he added.

 

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko has been nominated for Prime Minister, Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel. Under Ukrainian laws, candidates for prime minister, nominated by the president, are appointed by the Verkhovna Rada.

Outgoing Prime Minister Denis Shmygal, who has led the government since March 2020, will become Ukraine's new defense minister, Zelensky announced a bit later, while current Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will become the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, media reported. Zelensky executed a similar reassignment earlier when he transferred former Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny to the position of ambassador to the United Kingdom.

On Monday, US Special Presidential Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on a week-long visit. On July 14, he met with Zelensky who wrote on his Telegram channel that the two sides discussed assistance to Ukrainian air defenses, the procurement of weapons by Europe, and anti-Russian sanctions.

Sviridenko's appointment has been pre-agreed with the West and completely suits Zelensky and the head of his office, Andrey Yermak, Ivan Skorikov, head of the Ukraine Department at the Institute of CIS Studies, told Vedomosti. The new PM is a technocrat politician who has no political ambitions whatsoever. So, the presidential office is recruiting `unambitious individuals' who cannot overshadow Zelensky. According to Skorikov, the cabinet reshuffle will be followed by a series of criminal cases against corrupt politicians implicated with schemes involving Western aid to Ukraine.

Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky, associate professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, says Sviridenko is a partner trusted by the West who, among other things, favors selling Ukrainian agricultural land to the Americans or lobbies for the interests of Western companies in Ukraine.

It looks like Kiev's cabinet shake-up is all about money and weapons, Alexander Malkevich, a member of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, commented to Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Zelensky will perhaps try to replace Zaluzhny, his election rival, too, and the leadership may as well oust current commander-in-chief Alexander Syrsky, a convenient person to be blamed for all failures on the front line. "It looks like a series of reshuffles can take place here to facilitate the win of the pro-presidential party in a future election," the political analyst noted.

Meanwhile, media reported on Monday morning that Zelensky submitted bills to extend martial law and general mobilization for 90 days from August 7 as part of a 16th measure since the large-scale armed confrontation with Russia began in February 2022.

 

The European Union finds it increasingly difficult to impose new sanctions on Russia. This time around, Brussels failed to agree on another package of restrictions because of Malta, Politico reported. Maltese officials resisted the proposal put forward by the European Commission to set an oil price cap on Russian oil exports at 15% below the market price. Apart from Malta, Slovakia and Hungary, too, oppose exerting pressure on the Russian energy sector. However, the EU is already working on a potential 19th sanctions package, MEPs told Izvestia.

The 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions that the EU has yet to agree includes a ban on using the infrastructure of the two Nord Stream gas pipelines. Restrictions would also target two Chinese lenders that cooperate with Moscow, and a Russian oil refinery in India.

The oil price ceiling is the least effective of all sanctions imposed since 2022, says Sergey Tereshkin, Director General of Open Oil Market. According to him, EU countries are guided by bureaucratic logic as the adoption of each new package creates an appearance of ‘doing something', regardless of whether individual measures work or not.

Besides, the fundamental factors of the oil market, rather than restrictions imposed by the EU or the G7, largely impact compliance with the oil price cap, with Urals following the lead of Brent as it trades at a $10 to $12 discount to the benchmark. "Therefore, the Urals price may drop below $50 per barrel only if Brent hovers at around $60. However, fundamental factors are not yet aligned for that, even amid a drag on demand and higher OPEC+ quotas," Tereshkin adds.

Apart from Malta, Slovakia, Hungary, and some other EU countries may voice concerns about maritime trade or finance, among other specific sectors, MEP Tomas Zdechovksy noted, even as there is no broad consolidated opposition beyond these three countries. And the EU is already discussing additional sanctions, despite all differences. "A 19th package is being considered already, albeit the discussions are at an early and unofficial stage. A technical, not political weariness of sanctions has been a key hurdle," Zdechovksy told Izvestia. Coordinating new sanctions has been increasingly difficult as fresh measures should be targeted, legally sound, and feasible, he argued.

 

In June, global aluminum prices grew to a three-month high amid the escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict to reach the average monthly level of $2,516 per ton, last month's report from Kept shows. The metal saw a 3% rise from May and the prices continued to grow in July, according to data from the London Metal Exchange (LME): on July 14, three-month aluminum rose to $2,593 per metric ton, an increase of 6% from early June, and, on July 10, aluminum traded even higher, at $2,611/ (+7%), or a record since March.

Analysts at Kept explain last month's increase in prices with traders' concerns that political tensions in the Middle East will trigger aluminum supply disruptions. According to the International Aluminium Institute, the Gulf countries account for 9% of global aluminum production. Excluding the largest supplier, China, their share amounts to 21% globally, Kept noted.

Aluminum prices rose in June because US tariff talks with a number of countries broke down, Maxim Khudalov, an independent industry expert, maintains. Alexey Kalachev, an analyst at Finam, agrees that US import tariffs have pushed metal prices higher. Since early April, aluminum prices have grown by around 10%, even as they trade below the level seen in February, Kalachev said. According to the expert, the global market is still experiencing oversupply, and aluminum production exceeded consumption by almost 540,000 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025.

Russia is the world's third-largest aluminum supplier after China and India, and Rusal is Russia's largest aluminum producer and exporter. Last year, the Russian aluminum monopoly raised production by 4% to 3.99 million metric tons. Higher aluminum prices have supported Rusal's revenue but they do not guarantee it any growth in financial performance, Vasily Danilov, a lead analyst at Veles Capital, told Vedomosti. However, he expects Rusal's revenue to grow by 11% in 2025, predicting that its EBITDA and profitability will reach approximately 9% and 12% respectively.

 

On Monday, Bitcoin beat another historical record by climbing above $123,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency is becoming an increasingly important asset for both institutional investors and individual companies. Besides, market players expect the Fed to ease its monetary policy soon, which is pushing up demand for high-risk assets.

Alexander Kraiko, a lead analyst at Cifra Markets, noted that the Bitcoin price rose from $119,000 to $123,000 between 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. Moscow time (GMT +3) on July 14, which reflects "the high demand for bitcoin from Asian investors."

Market players say Bitcoin has been recognized as a financial asset on Wall Street. There has been a steady inflow of institutional funds into this segment of late, mostly through spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Experts estimate that the leading cryptocurrency could as well rise to $135,000 or even $150,000 in the coming months amid positive investor sentiment. Nor do they rule out any major price corrections. Ryan Lee, a lead analyst at Bitget Research, says Bitcoin may "fall back to the range of $105,000 to $115,000 against the backdrop of profit-taking, debates about the rate and geopolitical risks." Uncertainty around Trump's trade policy, too, remains. Vasily Girya, CEO of GIS Mining, told Kommersant that "investors are balancing between optimism over potential monetary easing by the Fed, risks of escalating trade wars, and geoeconomics." However, he doubts Bitcoin will rise above $160,000 this year in the absence of new fundamental drivers.

President Donald Trump said on July 14 that he would impose “very severe” secondary tariffs on Russia if President Vladimir Putin does not agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine in 50 days.

“We're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said. “It's very simple, and they'll be at 100 percent.”

Reuters

11:48 JST, July 15, 2025

July 15 (Reuters) – A million more children completed the critical three-dose vaccination against diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to new data released by the World Health Organization.

Despite the progress, drastic changes in funding, growing global conflicts, and rising vaccine misinformation threaten to further stall or even reverse progress which poses a threat.

“We've hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult,” WHO's director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, Kate O'Brien, told reporters.

In 2024, 89% of infants globally, about 115 million, received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, and roughly 109 million completed all three doses of the staple shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, also known as whooping cough, according to the new national immunization coverage data released on Tuesday by the WHO and UNICEF.

But, nearly 20 million infants missed at least one dose of DTP-containing vaccine, which includes 14.3 million “zero-dose” children who never received a single dose of any vaccine.

This is 4 million more than the target for the year needed to stay on track with Immunization Agenda 2030 goals, the report added.

The world is currently off track for the goal, which has been to halve the number of zero-dose children and achieve at least 90% global immunization coverage.

Data shows a quarter of the world's infants live in just 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict, or humanitarian crises, yet make up half of all unvaccinated children globally.

In half of these countries the number of unvaccinated children has expanded rapidly from 3.6 million in 2019 to 5.4 million in 2024.

“We're starting to see the emerging signs of slippage, and in other countries, stalling of vaccine coverage,” said O'Brien.

Despite the challenges, countries have been able to scale up vaccines for diseases such as HPV, meningitis, pneumococcal disease, polio, and rotavirus.

In 2024, 31% of eligible adolescent girls globally received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine.

While this is far from the 90% coverage target by 2030, it represents a substantial increase from the 17% coverage in 2019.

Global coverage against measles also improved, but the overall coverage rate is far below the 95% needed in every community to prevent outbreaks.

“The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. The European Union has begun informal discussions on a 19th package of anti-Russian sanctions, Czech MEP Tomas Zdechovsky told Izvestia.

"Discussions on the 19th package are already underway, although they are at an early and informal stage. The main problem is sanctions fatigue - not political, but technical. After 18 packages, restrictions have already been imposed on most obvious targets. Now the focus is on tightening controls, expanding secondary restrictions, and clarifying export and import controls," Zdechovsky stated.

The 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions has not yet been agreed upon within the EU. Hungary and Slovakia continue to oppose the European Commission's plan to ban oil and gas supplies from Russia to the EU by early 2028.

On June 23, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that during a meeting of EU foreign ministers that day, he and his Slovak counterpart, Juraj Blanar, blocked the approval of the 18th package and demanded that Brussels' energy plan be removed from the agenda.

            Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that last week's memo declining to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “speaks for itself,” rejecting questions about making more documents public.
    


            “Today our memo speaks for itself, and we will get back to you about anything else,” Bondi told reporters Tuesday, responding to questions about President Donald Trump's earlier comment that Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible.”
    


            At the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he stood behind Bondi, responding to a question about his daughter-in-law Lara Trump saying that there needs to be “more transparency” around the Epstein investigation.
    


            “The attorney general has handled that very well … really done a very good job,” Trump said.
    


            “I would like to see that also,” the president added, in an apparent reference to the call for more transparency. “But I think the attorney general — the credibility is very important, and you want credible evidence for something like that, and I think the attorney general's handled it very well.”
    


            Additionally, Trump said Bondi has not told him that his name appears in the Epstein files, despite previous accusations from ex-Trump ally Elon Musk.
    


            “No, no, she's given just a very quick briefing,” Trump told reporters.
    


            Bondi's comments came during a press conference at the Drug Enforcement Agency, highlighting law enforcement seizures of 64,000 pounds of methamphetamines — including those in pill form — in drug busts since January. Several happened over the July 4th holiday weekend.
    


            Though the surge in drugs like meth-laced pills is a national threat — and drug cases are of particular importance to the attorney general — it was not enough to divert attention from the Epstein controversy.
    


            The department is keen to change the current conversation around Epstein, sources tell CNN, and is prioritizing putting Bondi in front of cameras to discuss other Trump priorities like the drug busts discussed Tuesday. Their hope is that the controversy will die down despite the enormous amount of backlash the department is facing from Trump's own supporters.
    


            That was evident during the event Tuesday, as reporters repeatedly asked about additional disclosures, as well as her relationship with FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Bondi repeatedly said she would not answer questions on the matter.
    


            Bondi said that she, Patel and Bongino are “all committed” to “fighting as a team” to accomplish Trump administration priorities like reducing violent crime.
    


            “I'm going to be here as long as the president wants me here, and I believe he's made that crystal clear it's four years,” Bondi said of the drama and subsequent calls for her resignation.
    


            “Well, three and a half now, right?” she said.
    


            Trump was also asked at the White House if he has faith in Bongino, who CNN has reported has clashed with Bondi over the release of files related to the Epstein investigation.
    


            “I like Dan Bongino,” Trump said.

In a press gaggle on Thursday, President Donald Trump hailed the Big Beautiful Bill's passing both houses of Congress and referred to it as an economic "rocket ship."

FIRST ON FOX: The White House rolled out an interactive map of the U.S. showing the savings Americans can expect from initiatives under President Donald Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act on a state-by-state basis, Fox News Digital learned Tuesday. 

Trump signed the massive piece of legislation into law on the Fourth of July, touting that its tax cuts will make the U.S. economy similar to a "rocket ship" as Americans begin feeling its effects. 

On Tuesday, the White House published an interactive map of the 50 states that provides breakdowns of how much Americans can expect to save and see in their pocketbooks compared to if the bill had not been passed and signed into law. 

The interactive map focused on data such as: real wage increases, which are understood as the increase to a worker's income after accounting for inflation; a family's expected real take-home pay increase; how many seniors benefit from the no tax on Social Security; the percentage of a state's labor force who are expected to benefit from not paying taxes on tips; the number of jobs protected in a state, and other data.

In California, the nation's most populated state, residents can expect a real wage increase of $4,900 to $8,800 and a real take-home pay increase of $8,500 to $12,500 for a typical family with two kids, according to the map. 

"A typical family with two children in California can expect to see higher take-home pay of about $8500 to $12500 with OBBB compared to if it was not passed," states the map, which includes links to more detailed data on any given state. "Around 4% of the labor force is employed in occupations that would likely benefit from the no taxes on tips provision of the OBBB. Around 6.0 million seniors in California could benefit from the no taxes on Social Security provision of the OBBB."

STEVE MOORE: TRUMP JUST SCORED THE BIGGEST CONSERVATIVE VICTORY IN THREE DECADES

Residents in a Heartland State such as Nebraska can expect a real wage increase of $3,700 to $6,600 and a real take-home pay increase for a typical family with two children of $7,300 to $10,300. The map also touts 300,000 seniors in the Cornhusker State are expected to benefit from the lack of tax on Social Security, and an expected 29% of the state's labor force is expected to benefit from the lack of tax on overtime pay. 

On the East Coast, residents of New Jersey can expect real wage increases of $5,000 to $9,000, and a real take-home pay increase of $8,600 to $12,700 for typical families with two children, according to the data reviewed by Fox News Digital. New Yorkers can expect a $4,400 to $8,000 real wage increase, and a real take-home pay increase of $8,000 to $11,700, data show.

Trump had been rallying Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation since the early days of his administration this year, as it advances his agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt.

House and Senate Republicans delivered the legislation to Trump's desk in July after a hard-fought battle that included a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in their condemnation of the bill, mostly over its increase to the debt limit. 

A handful of Republicans, such as Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against their chamber's respective versions of the bill due to its $5 trillion increase to the debt limit. Former Trump ally Elon Musk also broke with the president over the bill, calling on lawmakers to "kill the bill" as it made its way through Congress due to its increase to the U.S. debt ceiling. 

The bill ultimately passed and includes key provisions to permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporates new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay. It also rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump's mass deportation efforts, and institutes Medicaid reforms. 

WHITE HOUSE HANDS AMERICANS 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' CALCULATOR TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH THEY'D SAVE UNDER ACT

"We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent," Trump said during the signing ceremony. "That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country.… After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.… It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families.… The Golden Age of America is upon us."

NEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised the bill in an opinion piece published on Fox News Digital earlier in July, celebrating that Americans can expect to keep "an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hailed the passage of the "big, beautiful bill" for the prosperity it will bring to the U.S. (Pool)

"The bill prevents a $4.5 trillion tax hike on the American people," he wrote in an op-ed published July 4. "This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay. Add to this the president's ambitious deregulation agenda, which could save the average family of four an additional $10,000. For millions of Americans, these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college."

"The One Big Beautiful Bill also codifies no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay — both policies designed to provide financial relief to America's working class," he added. "These tax breaks will ensure Main Street workers keep more of their hard-earned income. And they will bolster productivity by rewarding Americans who work extra hours. All Americans can learn how President Trump's tax cuts will impact their lives for the better with a new White House calculator."

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — Mike Waltz painted an image for lawmakers Tuesday of what the United Nations would look like as the U.S. — its largest donor — reviews its support, opting to go “back to basics” under a Trump administration push to “make the U.N. great again.” 

During his Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Waltz echoed the priorities of his bosses — President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio — of pursuing major reforms to the 80-year-old world body.

It was the first time senators could grill Waltz since he was ousted as Trump's national security adviser in May after he mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans. He denied Tuesday that he was removed from the post, while laying out his plans to bring “America First” to the U.N.

“We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk — where China, Russia, Europe and the developing world can come together and resolve conflicts,” Waltz told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the U.N. “But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking.”

The U.N. is pursuing its own reforms while the Republican administration has spent the last six months reshaping American diplomacy and working aggressively to shrink the size of the federal government, including recent mass dismissals at the State Department.




On the agenda for Waltz would be combating China's influence, reviewing U.S. funding to U.N. agencies with “often duplicative and wasteful mandates,” as well as rooting out what Waltz called deep antisemitism within the U.N. system. 

The U.N. post is the last one to be filled in Trump's Cabinet following months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee.

The Signal episode — in which Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other high-level officials faced intense criticism — didn't come up at the hearing for more than an hour.

It was revealed in March that Waltz added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen.

“We both know Signal is not an appropriate and secure means of communicating highly sensitive information,” said Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who was first to raise the issue. 

He added that Waltz shared “demonstrably sensitive information” in an improper manner. Fellow Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia called it “an amateurish move.”

Waltz, a former Florida congressman, said the chat met the administration's cybersecurity standards, “no classified information was shared” and the military was still conducting an ongoing investigation. 

Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey blasted what he called a “lack of accountability” from Waltz and other administration officials.

“I've watched this hearing, and I've been really disappointed,” Booker said. “What's been troubling to me about your nomination from the beginning is your failure to just stand up and take accountability for mistakes that you made.”

If confirmed, Waltz would arrive at the U.N. at a moment of great change. The world body is reeling from Trump's decision to slash foreign assistance — affecting its humanitarian aid agencies — and it anticipates U.S. funding cuts to the U.N. annual budget.

Facing financial instability, the U.N. has spent months shedding jobs and consolidating projects while beginning to tackle long-delayed reforms. The U.N. is also facing growing frustration over what critics describe as a lack of efficiency and power in delivering on its mandate to end conflict.

“With Waltz at the helm, the U.N. will have what I regard as what should be its last chance to demonstrate its actual value to the United States,” said Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. “Instead of progressive political virtue signaling, the Security Council has the chance to prove its value, and settling disputes and brokering deals.”

Waltz said U.N. revenue “has quadrupled in the last 20 years” but that it hasn't been commensurate with increased peace.

“The U.S. must ensure that every foreign aid dollar and every contribution to an international organization, particularly the U.N., draws a straight and direct line to a compelling U.S. national interest,” Waltz said.

He said the administration's diplomatic strategy would be focused on cutting costs to what he called “waste, fraud, and abuse that are endemic to the U.N. system.”

Waltz also accused the U.N. of “pervasive antisemitism.” He testified that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has been promoting “antisemitic hate” in its schools in Gaza.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appointed a British human rights activist on Tuesday to carry out a strategic review of UNRWA.

Israel has alleged that 19 out of UNRWA's roughly 13,000 staffers in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that launched the war. UNRWA said it fired nine workers after an internal U.N. investigation. Israel later alleged that about 100 other Palestinians in Gaza were Hamas members but didn't provide evidence to the United Nations.

Waltz has spent the last few months on the White House payroll despite departing as national security adviser. The latest list of White House salaries, current as of July 1, includes Waltz as an adviser earning an annual salary of $195,200.

A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Waltz stayed on to “ensure a smooth and successful transition given the extreme importance of the role of NSA.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, questioned why Waltz was still being paid by the administration.

“Throughout this year, you've made (assertions) that, if confirmed, you would root out waste and unnecessary overhead at the U.N. So can you confirm for us whether you've been receiving a salary from the White House since being let go as the NSA?”

Waltz denied the fact that he had been fired, saying he was being paid as an adviser “transitioning a number of important activities.”

Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon provides an update after nine people were killed and over 30 injured after a fire broke out at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts on Sunday, July 13, 2025. (Credit: WPRI)  

A survivor of a Sunday blaze that tore through an assisted living facility in Massachusetts has claimed that staff members abandoned the burning scene leaving the elderly residents to fend for themselves – while another said that workers didn't even knock at doors to alert the seniors as the flames spread.

Resident Lorraine Ferrara, 70, told the Associated Press of her shock to see staff running away from the fire that ultimately killed 9 people and injured dozens more at Gabriel House in Fall River. 

"They left us alone and ran," Ferrara said. "I was hanging out the window — ‘Help! Help!' — and they just kept running."

DEADLY OVERNIGHT BLAZE CLAIMS 9 LIVES AT MASSACHUSETTS ASSISTED LIVING HOME AS RESCUE EFFORTS CONTINUE

Meanwhile, resident Robert Cabral also said that workers fled the terrifying scene as smoke filled rooms. 

"They didn't knock on one door," Cabral said. "They just ran."

Fox News Digital reached out to Gabriel Care, the operators of the facility, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. 

The deceased were aged 61 to 86. The facility opened in 1999 and had 100 units with about 70 people residing there at the time.

As well as workers apparently fleeing the scene, reports have emerged of an alleged lack of fire drills at the facility, while a firefighters union said inadequate staffing hindered the response to the blaze.

Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts Secretary of Elder Affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned by reports about the apparent lack of fire drills as well a low number of staff for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows.

"It's a terrible tragedy that should have never happened," Lanzikos told the Associated Press.

SEVEN MISSING AFTER POWERFUL EXPLOSION AT CALIFORNIA FIREWORKS FACILITY AS EVACUATION ORDERS REMAIN IN PLACE

About 50 firefighters responded to the scene at around 9:50 p.m., including 30 who were off duty. Police also helped break down doors and carried about a dozen residents to safety. Five injured firefighters were released from the hospital Monday.

Edward Kelly, president of the national firefighters union, said eight additional firefighters would have been on scene if national staffing recommendations were followed.

Capt. Frank O'Reagan said there was no breathing equipment available when he arrived, so he started going door to door on the third floor without an air tank until the smoke got to him.

O'Reagan's brother and fellow firefighter Michael O'Reagan said he was shocked that 40 minutes after firefighters arrived, a large part of the building had not been searched.

"We did the best we could with what we had, and what we had was not enough," said Michael O'Reagan, president of the Fall River firefighters union.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Officials said it did not appear suspicious, 

Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon told Boston 25 News that staffing levels is not unique to Fall River and that municipalities across the Commonwealth face similar concerns.

"The crews were faced with an incredibly difficult situation. A fire is a difficult situation, a rescue is a difficult situation," Bacon said. "When you combine the two at the level this call asked for, it was almost an impossible situation."

A federal judge barred the Trump administration from using its ban on travelers from some countries to keep 80 already-vetted refugees from entering the United States.

In a decision late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle said President Donald Trump's June order banning the entry of people from 12 countries “expressly states” that it does not limit the ability of people to seek refugee status. 

The order, dubbed “Proclamation 10949—Restricting The Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,” includes a provision that says nothing in it “shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT, consistent with the laws of the United States.”

In his ruling, Whitehead said “by its plain terms, the Proclamation excludes refugees from its scope.”

Barring refugees from entering the U.S. would limit their ability to seek refugee status and therefore run counter to the Republican president's order, the judge added.

He ordered the administration to immediately resume processing 80 “presumptively protected refugees” that were rejected based on the travel ban.




The State Department did not immediately have comment Tuesday.

Whitehead also laid out a process for the government to vet refugees from the countries covered by the travel ban and other countries who were denied entry when the president suspended the nation's refugee admissions program within hours of taking office on Jan. 20. 




The decision left thousands of refugees who had already gone through a sometimes years-long vetting process to start new lives in America stranded at various locations around the world, including relatives of active-duty U.S. military personnel and more than 1,600 Afghans who assisted America's war efforts. 

Under a framework established by an appellate court, those refugees should be admitted if they had previously been cleared for travel to the U.S., had arranged and confirmable travel plans and had taken steps such as selling property or giving up their home that showed a reliance on the U.S. government's assurance of their refugee status.

The administration has previously said 12,000 people had been approved and booked for travel as refugees before it suspended the refugee program. Many of those cases will now have to be examined individually to see whether they meet the appeals court's criteria for entry. 

The lawsuit Whitehead is overseeing was filed in February by some individual refugees along with refugee aid organizations who said the administration froze their funding. The plaintiffs later asked the judge to make the case a class-action lawsuit so that the rulings could apply to other refugees facing similar circumstances. 

Whitehead said the suspension likely amounted to a nullification of congressional will, since Congress created and funded the refugee admissions program. He issued a preliminary injunction barring the federal government from suspending refugee processing and refugee aid funding. 

But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put most of that decision on hold in March, finding the administration was likely to win the case because the president has broad authority to determine who is allowed to enter the country. The appeals court later set out the criteria for admitting some of the refugees.

            The hottest topic in Atlanta ahead of Tuesday's Major League Baseball All-Star Game isn't a player, a coach or a manager.
    


            It's not even human.
    


            For the first time, the midsummer classic is going to be using automated technology to allow pitchers, catchers and batters to challenge balls and strikes – a system that's been in use in the minor leagues and in spring training but had never been put in place before at a major league park.
    


            It's a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the game, a system that might forever change one of the ficklest parts of an incredibly fickle game: The ever-changing, unpredictable strike zone put in place by all-too-human home plate umpires.
    


            Pitchers are largely unfazed – at least before the game gets going.
    


            “I don't plan on using them. I'm probably not going to use them in the future. I'm gonna let the catcher do that,” said Tarik Skubal, the Detroit Tigers star who will start the game for the American League. “I have this thing where I think everything's a strike until the umpire calls it a ball.”
    


            Paul Skenes, the Pittsburgh Pirates fireballer who will start for the National League, felt much the same way.
    


            “Pitchers think that everything's a strike, then you go back and look at it and it's two, three balls off,” he said Monday. “So, we should not be the ones that are challenging it. I really do like the human element of the game. I think this is one of those things that you kind of think that umpires are great until they're not, and so I could kind of care less either way, to be honest.”
    


            According to MLB, the challenge system will have the same rules as were used in spring training: Each team starts the game with two challenges and they keep their challenge if they are deemed correct. Only the pitcher, catcher and hitter can challenge a call and the system is put into place when one of those players taps the top of his cap or helmet twice.
    


            The system was in place during the Futures Game at Truist Park on Saturday between some of the game's top minor league prospect. When a player would challenge a call, the game would pause, and attention would turn to the stadium's massive screen beyond right center field.
    


            A virtual simulation of the pitch would be shown along with a strike zone and the technology would rule if the ball fell within or outside the box. Play would then resume after the short break.
    


            It's unclear exactly how the league will determine the size of those strike zones for each batter, and that's something Los Angeles Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw wants to know.
    


            “I did a few rehab starts with it. I'm OK with it, you know, I think, I mean, it works,” he told reporters on Monday. “I just don't really understand how they're doing the box for the hitter, because I think every different TV or national streaming service has their own box. I think I just hope that they figure out, because Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes, so … know they've obviously thought about that. I haven't talked to MLB about it, but as long as that gets figured out, I think it'd be fun.”
    


            The phrase used most on Monday when discussing the technology was an iconic one in baseball lore: The “human element.”
    


            It's one of the things that can make baseball so perfectly imperfect – the ability of umpires to simply get it wrong and make a massive impact on the game. From Jim Joyce ruling a batter safe to ruin Armando Galarraga's perfect game bid to Don Dekinger's World Series-changing call in 1985, ruling Kansas City Royals player Jorge Orta was safe at first base even though replays showed he was out by a step. Instead of being the last out of a St. Louis Cardinals World Series championship, the moment became the spark for the Royals to charge back and win the title.
    


            The “human element” is one of baseball's quirks that give the nation's pastime its identity. But it's also something that many fans would rather see cast off into obscurity.
    


            Chris Sale, the Atlanta Braves pitcher and reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, said he still wants it to be part of the game.
    


            “Honestly, for me, I kind of like the human element, right? Like I understand why they want to use ABS. And I don't think it's a perfect system yet,” he said. “I kind of like the old feel, the old way of doing it.”

NEW YORK (AP) — As his supporters erupt over the Justice Department's failure to release much-hyped records in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking investigation, President Donald Trump's strategy has been to downplay the issue.

His problem? That nothing-to-see-here approach doesn't work for those who have learned from him that they must not give up until the government's deepest, darkest secrets are exposed.

Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI abruptly walked back the notion that there's an Epstein client list of elites who participated in the wealthy New York financier's trafficking of underage girls. Trump quickly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi and chided a reporter for daring to ask about the documents.

The online reaction was swift, with followers calling the Republican president “out of touch” and demanding transparency.

On Saturday, Trump used his Truth Social platform to again attempt to call supporters off the Epstein trail amid reports of infighting between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the issue. He suggested the turmoil was undermining his administration — “all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.”

That did little to mollify Trump's supporters, who urged him to release the files or risk losing his base. At least one follower responded to Trump's post by saying it seemed as though the president was just trying to make the issue go away — but assured him it wouldn't.




The political crisis is especially challenging for Trump because it's one of his own making. The president has spent years stoking dark theories and embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda that casts him as the only savior who can demolish the “deep state.”

Now that he's running the federal government, the community he helped build is coming back to haunt him. It's demanding answers he either isn't able to or does not want to provide.

“The faulty assumption Trump and others make is they can peddle conspiracy theories without any blowback,” said Matt Dallek, a political scientist at George Washington University. “The Epstein case is a neat encapsulation that it is hard to put the genie back in the bottle.”

Last week's two-page statement from the Justice Department and the FBI saying they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a client list roiled Trump's supporters, who pointed to past statements from several administration officials that the list ought to be revealed.

Bondi had suggested in February that such a document was sitting on her desk waiting for review, though last week she said she had been referring generally to the Epstein case file and not a specific client list.

Conservative influencers have since demanded to see all the files related to Epstein's crimes, even as Trump has tried to put the issue to bed.

Far-right commentator Jack Posobiec said at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit on Saturday that he would not rest “until we go full Jan. 6 committee on the Jeffrey Epstein files.”

Trump's weekend post sought to divert attention by calling on supporters to focus instead on investigating Democrats and arresting criminals rather than “spending month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein.” His first-term national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, pleaded with him to reconsider.

“@realdonaldtrump please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away,” Flynn wrote, adding that failing to address unanswered Epstein questions would make facing other national challenges “much harder.”

Other Trump allies continue to push for answers, among them far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has called for Bondi to resign. She told Politico's Playbook newsletter on Sunday that a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the handling of the files on Epstein, who was found dead in his federal jail cell in 2019 about a month after he was arrested.

Experts who study conspiracy theories warned that more sunlight does not necessarily make far-fetched narratives disappear.

“For some portion of this set of conspiracy theory believers, no amount of contradictory evidence will ever be enough,” said Josephine Lukito, who studies conspiracy theorists at the University of Texas at Austin. 

The president and many figures in his administration — including Bondi,Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel — earned their political capital over the years in part by encouraging disproven conspiracy theories on a range of topics, from elections to vaccines.

Now, they're tasked with trying to reveal the evidence they'd long insisted was there — a challenge that's reached across the government.

Last week, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted on X what seemed like an endorsement of a notorious conspiracy theory that the contrails left by aircraft are releasing chemicals for potentially nefarious reasons. But a second post from Zeldin underscored the fine line the Trump administration is trying to walk by linking to a new page on the EPA website that essentially debunked the theory.

The value of conspiratorial fabrications is that they help people get political power, said Russell Muirhead, who teaches political science at Dartmouth College. He said Trump has exploited that “more ably than anybody probably in American history.”

But the Epstein case brings unique challenges, he said. That's because it's rooted in truth: A wealthy and well-connected financier did spend years abusing large numbers of young girls while escaping justice.

As a result, Trump needs to come forward with truth and transparency on the topic, Muirhead said. If he doesn't, “large segments of his most enthusiastic and devoted supporters are going to lose faith in him.”

As right-wing outrage over Epstein dominates the political conversation, Democrats and other Trump rivals have been taking advantage.

Several Democratic lawmakers have called for the release of all Epstein files and suggested Trump could be resisting because he or someone close to him is featured in them. Conservatives expressed concerns that Trump's approach on Epstein could hurt them in the midterms.

“For this to go away, you're going to lose 10% of the MAGA movement,” right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon said during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit on Friday.

There's also the challenge of governing.

Bondi and Bongino had a tense exchange last week at the White House over a story about Epstein, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.

And Loomer, who is close to Trump, said Friday she was told that Bongino was “seriously thinking about resigning.” Bongino showed up at work Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues. The FBI declined to comment.

Patel also took to social media Friday to dismiss what he called “conspiracy theories” that he himself would be leaving the administration.

Dallek, the George Washington University professor, said it's alarming that the country's top law enforcement officials are feuding over a conspiracy theory.

“It's possible at some time voters are going to notice the things they want or expect government to do aren't being done because the people in charge are either incompetent or off chasing rabbits,” he said. “Who is fulfilling the mission of the FBI to protect the American people?”

As Mike Waltz, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday for his confirmation hearing, focus returns to his ousting as national security adviser over what some referred to as “Signalgate.”

The former Florida Republican congressman served mere weeks in Trump's administration before revelations that he mistakenly added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic to a private Signal chat that was used to discuss sensitive military plans, including planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen.

Calls came quickly for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be removed from office, accompanied by criticism of the Trump administration for failing to take action against the top national security officials who discussed plans for the military strike in Signal. After weeks of scrutiny, Waltz left his security post but was swiftly nominated to the U.N. position.

Months after the chat was disclosed, questions remain over the controversy, including if federal laws were violated, if classified information was exposed on the commercial messaging app and if anyone else will face consequences. 

Here's what we know and don't know:

___

KNOWN: Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked. It is not approved for carrying classified information. On March 14, one day before the strikes, the Defense Department cautioned personnel about the vulnerability of Signal, specifically that Russia was attempting to hack the app, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak to the press and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 




One known vulnerability is that a malicious actor, if they have access to a person's phone, can link their own device to the user's Signal — and monitor messages remotely.

NOT KNOWN: How frequently the administration and the Defense Department use Signal for sensitive government communications, and whether those on the chat were using unauthorized personal devices to transmit or receive those messages. The department put out an instruction in 2023 restricting what information could be posted on unauthorized and unclassified systems. 

At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard would not say whether she was accessing the information on her personal phone or government-issued phone, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Security Council. 

___

KNOWN: The government has a requirement under the Presidential Records Act to archive all of those planning discussions. 

NOT KNOWN: Whether anyone in the group archived the messages as required by law to a government server. The images of the text chain posted by The Atlantic show that the messages were set to disappear in one week.

KNOWN: Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon's security protocols — known in the IT industry as a “dirty” internet line — set up in his office to use Signal on a personal computer, two people familiar with the line have told The Associated Press.

Other Pentagon offices have used them, particularly if there's a need to monitor information or websites that would otherwise be blocked. The biggest advantage of using such a line is that the user would not show up as an IP address assigned to the Defense Department — essentially the user is masked, according to a senior U.S. official familiar with military network security.

NOT KNOWN: If use of the line left any Defense-related materials more vulnerable than they would have been on a Pentagon secure line.

___

KNOWN: The chat group included 18 members, including Jeffrey Goldberg, top editor of The Atlantic. The group, called “Houthi PC Small Group,” likely for Houthi “principals committee” — was comprised of Trump's senior-most advisers on national security, including Gabbard, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.” 

NOT KNOWN: How Goldberg got added. Waltz said he built the message chain and didn't know how Goldberg ended up on the chat. He called it a mistake.

___

KNOWN: Just hours before the attack on the Houthis in Yemen began, Hegseth shared details on the timing, targets, weapons and sequence of strikes that would take place. 

NOT KNOWN: Whether the information was classified. Gabbard, Ratcliffe and the White House have all said it was not classified, and Hegseth said the same in a post on social media. Democrats said that strains credulity. 

___

KNOWN: Hegseth has adamantly denied that “war plans” were texted on Signal, something current and former U.S. officials called “semantics.” War plans carry a specific meaning. They often refer to the numbered and highly classified planning documents — sometimes thousands of pages long — that would inform U.S. decisions in case of a major conflict. 

But the information Hegseth did post — specific attack details selecting human and weapons storage targets — was a subset of those plans and was likely informed by the same classified intelligence. Posting those details to an unclassified app risked tipping off adversaries of the pending attack and could have put U.S. service members at risk, multiple U.S. officials said. 

Sharing that information on a commercial app like Signal in advance of a strike “would be a violation of everything that we're about,” said former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who served under Democratic President Barack Obama. 

NOT KNOWN: If anyone outside the messaging group got access to the Signal texts.

___

KNOWN: Hegseth began cracking down on unauthorized leaks of information inside the Defense Department, and his chief of staff issued a memo on March 21 saying the Pentagon would use polygraph tests to determine the sources of recent leaks and prosecute them.

NOT KNOWN: Whether Hegseth will take responsibility for the unauthorized release of national defense information regarding the attack plans on the Houthis. Trump in March bristled at a suggestion that Hegseth should step down, saying “He's doing a great job. He had nothing to do with it.”

___

KNOWN: In April, Dan Caldwell, a senior Hegseth adviser who in the Signal chat had been designated as the secretary's point person, was placed on administrative leave and escorted out of the Pentagon by security. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters told The AP that the former Marine's sudden downfall was tied to an investigation into unauthorized disclosure of department information. 

NOT KNOWN: If any others affiliated with the Signal situation will face reprisals.

___

KNOWN: Also in April, Hegseth was forced to defend himself against a second assertion that he shared classified material through an unapproved and unsecured network, this time taking airstrike information from a military communications channel and sharing it in a Signal chat with his wife, his brother and others. A person familiar with the chat confirmed to The AP that Hegseth pulled the information — such as launch times and bomb drop times of U.S. warplanes about to strike Houthi targets in Yemen — he posted in the chat from a secure communications channel used by U.S. Central Command. 

NOT KNOWN: If that's the extent of Hegseth's Signal usage.

___

KNOWN: The Pentagon's watchdog has begun looking into Hegseth's use of Signal, and also whether any of Hegseth's aides were asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter.

NOT KNOWN: What the inspector general will find, or what will be done as a result of those findings.

Counterterrorism expert Jonathan Gilliam said Iranian sleeper cells might be hiding "in plain sight" as Iran has issued threats against America.

A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman confirmed Tuesday that five Iranians were arrested while attempting to illegally cross the U.S. northern border with Canada.

"On July 1, Border Patrol Agents from the Champlain, New York Station, responded to suspicious activity near Mooers Forks, NY," CBP's Swanton Sector said on Facebook. "Agents located a minivan occupied by five citizens of Iran and two citizens of Uzbekistan."

The Champlain Station is part of the Swanton Sector. Swanton is a rural town in Vermont near Highway 89 just south of the Canadian Border.

MORE IRANIANS WITH CRIMINAL HISTORIES ARRESTED BY ICE IN TRUMP'S SECURITY SWEEP: 'WORST OF THE WORST'

CBP said that all seven men had been previously arrested for attempting to cross the border illegally. All seven aliens are detained and awaiting deportation.

"They are currently detained and pending removal proceedings," CBP said. "Border security is national security and directly correlates to public safety, Swanton Sector Agents remain vigilant and committed to protecting our borders and enforcing immigration laws."

Earlier this month, a counterterrorism expert told Fox News Digital that Iranian terrorist sleeper cells could be hiding in plain sight. The U.S. military crippled several Iranian nuclear sites after targeted airstrikes on June 22. 

"Where these sleeper cells may be is in plain sight," former FBI special agent and terrorism task force member Jonathan Gilliam said. "And that's the real terrifying part of this is that putting people in place, as we've seen over the past four years, everyone's scrambling because certain amounts of people could come in here and get in here."

TOM HOMAN WARNS IRANIAN 'SLEEPER CELLS' COULD BE HIDING IN US AS RESULT OF BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS

Gilliam pointed to the Biden administration's border policies as a reason for concern.

"They could even go to the border and say they [want to] seek asylum, and the Biden administration, instead of putting them into DHS housing or ICE housing and holding them there so they could have their first appearance. To be vetted and whether or not they get asylum," he said. 

In a 2023 terrorism report released by the State Department in December of last year, the federal government outlined numerous instances of worrying behavior by Iranian nationals in western countries. 

"In 2023 the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging three individuals connected with Iran in a plot to assassinate an Iranian dissident in New York City," that report said. "Also in 2023, a United Kingdom court found a man guilty of attempting to collect information for terrorist purposes on the London-based Iran International, a media company that is critical of the Iranian regime."

"In recent years, Albania, Belgium, and the Netherlands have all either arrested, convicted, or expelled Iranian government officials implicated in various terrorist plots in their respective territories. Denmark similarly recalled its ambassador from Tehran after learning of an Iran-backed plot to kill an Iranian dissident in that country."

The Ryder Cup countdown is on, and this year has the potential to be one for the history books.

This year's event will take place at Bethpage Black outside of New York City. It will be the second time a team competition has been in the tri-state area, along with the 2017 Presidents Cup at Liberty National in Jersey City.

The United States and Europe have alternated winning the Cup, with the home team winning each event, rather convincingly, each year since 2016.

Xander Schauffele has been a part of Team USA for each Ryder and Presidents Cup since 2019, and he currently has an automatic bid as the second-ranked American in the FedEx Cup standings (the top six players get automatic bids).

However, his own dad wants no part of it.

Stefan Schauffele told The London Times that he is "not going" to the Ryder Cup in September.

"I'm afraid of what's going to happen in New York. I was there [at Whistling Straits] when they called Shane Lowry's wife a whore in front of him. I couldn't believe my ears," Stefan revealed.

Stefan also said he was turned off by the tempers flaring between Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava, in Rome two years ago. 

McIlroy was not happy with LaCava's celebration of a long putt from Cantlay, who opted not to wear a hat in protest of players not being paid to play in the event. This year, U.S. players will receive a $200,000 stipend and another $300,000 to donate to charity.

"That was utterly disgusting claiming this money bulls---, and Rory behaved disgustingly in my opinion," Schauffele continued. "It's only going to get worse. It's ruined my appetite for the Ryder Cup. It becomes unwatchable."

McIlroy then had to be held back from LaCava in the parking lot after the round.

The rivalry between the two teams is undoubtedly hotter than ever - but apparently, Mr. Schauffele has no interest.

House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, was praised for the role he played in the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. However, the congressman says this is the beginning, not the end, of spending reforms.

"We will never be able to get a balanced budget or even put our country on a path to a balanced budget and a sustainable fiscal trajectory in one reconciliation bill," Arrington told Fox News Digital. "We're too far down the broken road of bad and irresponsible fiscal behavior. We're too deep in the debt hole for one bill to do it."

Arrington, whom House Speaker Mike Johnson called the "the lead budget hawk in the House," said he is "obsessed" with tackling deficit spending, which he sees as the biggest threat to America's future. He believes that addressing the nation's situation in an effective way means creating the "conditions for growing the economy."

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOWCASE THEY 'TOOK ACTION' WITH PASSAGE OF TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

"So, the pro-growth policies, the tax cuts, the work incentives, opening up our energy assets and deregulating the energy economy, all of those pro- growth policies will reignite economic growth. And that is the foundation for our country's fiscal health and just about everything else: our military prowess, our global leadership, our way of life," Arrington said.

The Big Beautiful Bill's journey to President Donald Trump's desk was not pretty, as the legislation received criticism from both sides of the aisle and caused tension among Republicans.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Elon Musk, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and others argued that it did not take adequate measures to cut government spending. Arrington said he respects Massie and Musk — as well as other critics — but believes that the risk of losing the "good things" in the bill was too high. In the end, the Texas lawmaker sees the tradeoff as "permanent pro-growth tax policy" in exchange for the extra spending in the legislation.

"I think there's a big gap in information — and accurate information. Part of it is you've got the Congressional Budget Office putting out these big numbers… two and a half or three trillion dollars in additional deficit that would be added to the national debt over the 10-year budget window as a result of this bill. That is just patently false. It's completely inaccurate," Arrington said, adding that they fail to "consider economic growth and the revenue that will flow back into the treasury when you have pro-growth policies."

SCOTT BESSENT: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY

Trump signed the bill on his self-imposed July 4 deadline, just one day after the House passed the final version of the $3.3 trillion legislation. 

Before signing the bill, the president said it would "fuel massive economic growth" and "lift up the hard-working citizens who make this country run."

So, what's next on the budget chairman's agenda? Just one thing — or three, as he said to Fox News Digital, "spending cuts, spending cuts and spending cuts."

"We didn't get into this mess overnight, we won't get out of it overnight, but we'll never get out if we don't start exercising the political will to do what we all say in our campaigns," Arrington told Fox News Digital. "I think we established a great model for restoring fiscal health, and we just have to continue to repeat it and do it in even more dramatic fashion in the future."

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley raised no money in the latest campaign finance reporting period, despite being up for reelection next year.

Bradley has not formally announced her reelection bid but told WisPolitics in April that she planned to run to “ensure that there is a voice for the constitution and for the rule of law to preserve that in the state of Wisconsin.”

She has not raised money since 2022 when she reported $700, according to the Associated Press.

Her possible opponent, Wisconsin state Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor, raised $585,000 since launching her campaign in May.

“The overwhelming support for Judge Taylor early in this race shows how committed Wisconsinites are to reinforcing the majority on the court and electing a justice who will protect their rights and freedoms,” Taylor campaign manager Ashley Franz said in a statement. “Judge Taylor's broad base of support reflects her commitment to serving all Wisconsinites and ensuring our courts remain fair and independent.”

Bradley was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by then-Gov. Scott Walker in 2015 and won a full 10-year term in 2016. She is one of the most outspoken justices on the court.

Her lack of funds comes as the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race was the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history, beating the state's 2023 Supreme Court race, which, at the time, was the most expensive judicial race. Justice-elect Susan Crawford and her conservative opponent, Brad Schimel, raised a combined $100 million.

Taylor's haul outpaces that of Crawford's $460,000 haul in the same time frame.

The state's 2026 Supreme Court race will be less high-stakes than the last two, as it does not have the ability to sway the ideological leaning of the court. Crawford's win means liberal-leaning justices will retain control of the high court until at least 2028.

EVERY WISCONSIN COUNTY SHIFTED LEFT IN STATE SUPREME COURT RACE

Liberal-leaning candidates have won four of the last five Wisconsin Supreme Court elections by double-digit margins. If conservatives lose Bradley's seat next year, the court's 4-3 liberal majority will grow to 5-2.

The election, which is technically nonpartisan, will take place on April 7, 2026.

            There's growing concern for another significant rain and flooding event this week, this time along the Gulf Coast, from what could become the Atlantic basin's next tropical system.
    


            The potential storm's flood threat is just the latest in what has been a summer full of deadly and devastating floods.
    


            Right now, the would-be storm is a broad area of showers and thunderstorms off the east coast of Florida. It will drift west across Florida Tuesday, raising the flood threat there, and into the Gulf by midweek where it has a medium chance of becoming a tropical depression, according to the National Hurricane Center.
    


            If it can muster a more defined center of circulation and strengthen further it would become Dexter, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season — a mark typically reached around mid-August.
    


            If it does form, it would do so just off the Gulf Coast — a reminder that storms are more likely to form in the warm, shallow water closer to land in July. Warm water acts like fuel for storms to form and strengthen and ocean surface temperatures are well above average where the system is expected to track.
    


            Conditions aren't looking favorable for a strong storm right now because this system will likely not have much time to mature over water and will also have to overcome hostile upper-level winds that can rip apart storms.
    


            But a few reputable forecast models are predicting a more organized system, potentially a tropical storm, in the Gulf by late week. The outcome could hinge on the system's track. If it dips further south and spends more time over the Gulf it could become stronger if it can withstand the upper-level winds on its journey.
    


            Even if it isn't named, this system will bring tropical downpours to Florida and parts of the Gulf Coast over the next several days.
    


            There's a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain in parts of the Florida Peninsula including Tampa and Orlando Tuesday as the system taps into rich tropical moisture and enhances rainfall rates and the flood potential. The most intense storms are likely in the afternoon and evening as the system drifts across the state. Rainfall totals could range between 3 to 5 inches.
    


            But the most serious flood threat will come later this week and into the weekend as the system drifts west into parts of the north-central Gulf Coast, including Alabama, Mississippi and southeast Louisiana.
    


            Rain chances increase midweek across the north-central Gulf Coast, including Alabama, Mississippi and southeast Louisiana. Heavy rain could be long-lasting once it begins, possibly as soon as Wednesday night.
    


            Flash flooding is the main concern, especially if rain bands repeatedly track over the same areas which could happen if the system moves slowly and lingers.
    


            A Level 2 of 4 threat for flooding rain is in place Thursday for southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans and parts of coastal Alabama and Mississippi. By Friday, the threat increases to a Level 3 of 4 for parts of Louisiana including Baton Rouge over fears that heavy rain could linger. Several inches of rain are possible in the worst-case scenarios.
    


            It's clear that heavy rain and flooding will threaten much of the north-central Gulf Coast, but exactly where and how much remain in question. It will all depend on how strong the system becomes, where it tracks and how fast it moves – questions that will become sorted in the next couple of days.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told the young crowd at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit Friday that he is returning the U.S. military to its "warrior ethos." 

Secretary Pete Hegseth pulled senior Defense Department officials from the Aspen Security Conference for promoting the "evil of globalism." 

Military commanders were set to speak at the conference, which begins on Tuesday, as has been tradition through Republican and Democratic administrations. 

But Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson told Just the News the secretary's office believes the conference "promotes the evil of globalism, disdain for our great country, and hatred for the President of the United States."

Wilson added that DoD "has no interest in legitimizing an organization that has invited former officials who have been the architects of chaos abroad and failure at home."

The forum will host other Trump administration officials: Adam Boehler, presidential envoy for hostage response, and Tom Barrack, U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Syria. 

It will also hear from some contentious Biden administration officials – Jake Sullivan, former national security advisor, and Brett McGurk, a former National Security Council coordinator.

Mark Esper, Trump's former acting defense secretary, and David Petraeus, who was briefly CIA director under President Barack Obama, will also be speaking, along with Condoleezza Rice, a national security advisor and secretary of state during the Bush years. 

"Senior Department of Defense officials will no longer be participating at the Aspen Security Forum because their values do not align with the values of the DoD," chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement. 

"The Department will remain strong in its focus to increase the lethality of our warfighters, revitalize the warrior ethos, and project Peace Through Strength on the world stage. It is clear the ASF is not in alignment with these goals."

The Aspen Institute said in a statement on the Pentagon withdrawal: "For more than a decade, the Aspen Security Forum has welcomed senior officials – Republican and Democrat, civilian and military – as well as senior foreign officials and experts, who bring experience and diverse perspectives on matters of national security."

"We will miss the participation of the Pentagon, but our invitations remain open."

POMPEII, Italy (AP) — A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.

The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.

The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.

The mosaic — dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century — is considered a work of “extraordinary cultural interest,” experts said.

“It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. “While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.”

The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.

The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.

The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes.

“Today's return is like healing an open wound,” Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.

The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in “mentality,” as “the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.”

“We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,” Zuchtriegel said.

He recalled the so-called “Pompeii curse,” which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.

The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.

            Two research analysts made waves last week when they called for a major shakeup at tech giant Apple.
    


            The analysts weren't suggesting a logo or product redesign. Instead, they called for the replacement of Tim Cook, the CEO who directly succeeded Steve Jobs in 2011 and helped catapult the company to its $3 trillion valuation.
    


            Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone of LightShed Partners, a New York-based technology, media and telecommunications research firm, are questioning whether Cook is still the right person to lead one of the world's most valuable companies amid concerns that it's fallen behind in AI — a technology that's already disrupting work, education and other facets of everyday life. Apple has already faced pressure to come up with a new hit product as sales of smartphones, Apple's biggest revenue driver, have slowed across the industry.
    


            “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics,” the pair wrote on July 9.
    


            Replacing Cook would be a high-stakes move for Apple; the company is already undergoing leadership changes elsewhere in the C-suite, and changing CEOs could further pull focus away from running Apple's core business. Cook is also widely supported by Apple's board and has “staying power akin to other captains of industry” such as Disney's Bob Iger and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, reports Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has long tracked Apple's business strategy.
    


            There's no evidence to indicate Cook is going anywhere soon. Shares of Apple (AAPL) have skyrocketed under Cook's tenure, during which he's also built other lucrative products after the iPhone's success — such as smartwatches, earbuds and digital services.
    


            To be sure, the LightShed note is just one take in a crowded field of analysts and researchers who follow Apple's business. But it is perhaps an indication that Apple's AI setbacks are bigger than a standard product delay — to some, they're shaking confidence in Apple's ability to innovate. And Piecyk and Galone aren't the only ones questioning whether Apple needs fresh leadership.
    


            “He's a supply chain guy. They need a tech visionary,” said Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “I think they're in a lot more trouble than some people think.”
    


            Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Apple has grappled with a litany of challenges so far in 2025, among them: President Donald Trump's tariff threats; fresh restrictions from the European Union on how it runs its valuable App Store; and a federal judge allowing an antitrust lawsuit alleging it has monopolized the smartphone market to proceed.
    


            But concerns about the iPhone maker's slow progress in AI have been front and center.
    


            The company in March said it's delaying a long-awaited update to Siri that would have enabled it to answer more complex questions with personalized answers and handle tasks on a user's behalf. That type of change would bring Siri closer to more modern AI agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.
    


            The company hasn't said much about when the revamped Siri will arrive aside from needing “more time to reach our high-quality bar,” Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said in June at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference.
    


            The concern is broader than Siri alone, it's that Apple doesn't seem to have much to show for its AI efforts so far, Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin told CNN earlier this year. Apple has shaken up its AI leadership in an effort to accelerate its efforts in the space, according to Bloomberg.



            Apple Intelligence, which arrived in 2024 following the iPhone 16's September launch, includes tools that can summarize notifications, transcribe phone calls, erase objects in photos, and use an iPhone's camera to search Google or prompt ChatGPT and create images.
    


            Although Apple delayed the Siri update, it did announce a batch of new AI features coming this fall, including live-language translation, AI-generated workout insights for the Apple Watch and enhancements to existing features.
    


            But many of these upgrades are Apple playing catch-up to tools already offered by other tech companies, and may not be enough to position Apple as a leader.
    


            “(Cook) has done a great job of getting Apple to where it is, but the environment certainly has changed,” said Thomas Martin, partner and senior portfolio manager at investment firm Globalt. “They are really struggling on the AI front. It's a different animal, because AI is software, and Apple is traditionally almost exclusively hardware.”
    


            Under Cook's watch, other high-profile products or projects have fallen short of expectations in recent years.
    


            Last year, Apple launched the $3,500 Vision Pro headset, heralding it as the future of computing. But more than a year on, it remains a niche, novelty device as some of Apple's competitors are moving ahead with more stylish and practical augmented reality glasses.
    


            Also in 2024, Apple reportedly ended a decade-long effort to build an electric car, known internally as Project Titan, pulling the plug on what was believed to be an ambitious, expensive endeavor.
    


            Apple has made other significant changes to its leadership. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri was replaced at the start of 2025, although he remains vice president of corporate services according to Apple's website. And the company announced that longtime Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will leave the post this month and retire this year.
    


            Cook, 64, has been Apple's CEO for nearly 14 years and is widely respected for his operational acumen. He stepped out of the shadow of one of America's most iconic CEOs, Steve Jobs, and built a global supply chain and ecosystem of products and services that maintained Apple's place as one of the world's most valuable companies.
    


            He also carved out an important role for Apple in the digital health space with the Apple Watch, which was introduced in 2014 and was the first major new product launched under Cook's tenure. Apple is now a market leader in wearable technology, which includes both the Apple Watch and other devices like its AirPods — it claimed nearly a quarter of the global market for wearables as of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to market research firm the International Data Corporation.
    


            Under Cook's leadership, Apple's market cap went from just over $342 billion in August 2011 to roughly $3 trillion today. Even the two LightShed Partners analysts have acknowledged that Cook has done “a great job.”
    


            “To be clear, Tim Cook was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” the analysts wrote.
    


            And further change to Apple's executive ranks might hinder their efforts to expand in AI.
    


            “I think the last thing you want to do is further rock the boat by putting Tim Cook's job on the line,” said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. “I don't think Apple would even consider doing that.”
    


            He added that while it's clear Apple isn't moving fast enough in AI, “getting rid of Tim Cook” may not be the answer.
    


            Instead, the company could address its AI challenges with an acquisition — the company has reportedly discussed buying AI startup Perplexity — or by deepening its partnership with OpenAI, or following in Meta's footsteps by investing more heavily in top talent, Zino said.
    


            It's rare for any company to keep a CEO for more than 10 years, says William Klepper, academic director in executive education at Columbia Business School and author of the book “The CEO's Boss: Tough Love in the Boardroom.”
    


            “Organizations go up and down, right? It's just this nature of what we call the cycle of business,” he said. “And where they are now is in what I would call kind of a static state.”
    


            Keppler notes that the 10-year time frame isn't random. It usually coincides with a major disruptor that alters a company's business model, which in this case is AI. During those periods of change, companies like Apple need to support their core business while simultaneously adapting to what is coming next.
    


            “From my research and my model, you need a change agent … because you got to start a second wave,” he said. “You can't stay in an executive leadership role when you're at a point of inflection and need to change.”
    


            Companies usually install new CEOs for three reasons: in response to a scandal, to fix a crisis or over a loss of trust and competence, says Sandra Sucher, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. None of those scenarios apply to Cook or Apple.
    


            But one thing's clear: Pressure is mounting on Apple to figure it out –— and fast.
    


            “Do we have an Intel-ing of Apple?” said Martin, referring to the once-leading American chipmaker that fell far behind rivals like Nvidia and AMD after missing several major technology waves.
    


            “That would be so sad.”

Good disaster management is premised on preparation.

In the days since the Texas flash-flood disaster, the Department of Homeland Security has had a stock response to questions about delays in the federal government's response, or about a recent rule requiring DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to personally approve FEMA expenditures over $100,000, including rescue teams. The response goes, over and over, like this: “FEMA is shifting from bloated, DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens … The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.”



The Trump administration has been using this line for more than a month now, in response to criticism of its plans to remake, or perhaps disband, FEMA. And many people who study emergency response agree that, to some degree, the agency needs reform. Yet now the administration's press to quickly strip down the agency is being tested against a devastating disaster for the first time. And it is violating a basic precept of emergency management: Be prepared.



In any disaster, responding quickly can help save people and salve the harm. Protocols should be well known and well practiced before an event. An active disaster that killed more than 130 people, with more than 160 still missing, is not the occasion to switch up the norms. “This is exactly what many of us are concerned about,” Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Urban Institute, told me. However much FEMA might benefit from change, remaking it in an ad hoc fashion will just result in more devastation, he said: “In the context of a really complicated emergency where lots of people's lives are at stake—that's just not where you want to see experimentation happening.”

And FEMA's response to the Texas flash-flood disaster has not been business as usual. Noem didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of urban-search-and-rescue teams—deployed in the past within hours during similar events—until more than 72 hours after the flooding had begun, per CNN reporting. The agency failed to answer thousands of calls from flood survivors after allowing contracts for call-center workers to lapse one day after the disaster, according to The New York Times. FEMA had fewer than 100 people on the ground in Texas within four days of the disaster, and 311 by day five; within a week of Hurricane Helene, during what Donald Trump deemed a failed response to the flooding, FEMA deployed 1,500.



The situation on the ground in these immediate post-event moments can create a fog-of-war atmosphere, and no complete assessment of the federal government's reaction will be possible until later. “Like with any really catastrophic event, it's hard to understand what's happening at a micro level,” Rumbach said. Several non-FEMA rescue teams from other states and Mexico traveled to Texas to help, supplementing Texas's own robust emergency-response apparatus. But each of the other state teams waited on FEMA to call them up, as is protocol; FEMA didn't begin to activate any of them until last Monday, according to CNN. No missing person has been found alive since last Friday. “It's clear that the initial response was much smaller and more measured than you would expect from FEMA,” Rumbach said. “It's different from what you would expect a year ago, in terms of the number of personnel and the speed of response.” And FEMA is simply operating with fewer resources: About a quarter of the agency's staff has left since Trump took office in January, according to the Times. Due to vacancies, there is currently no FEMA regional administrator in any state along the Gulf Coast, just deputies.



Right now, rather than “lean” and “deployable,” it might be more appropriate to describe FEMA as  “starved and hobbled.” But ostensibly, a FEMA-review council assembled by the Trump administration is meant to offer a plan to overhaul the agency. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who praised the Trump administration's response to the flooding as “swift and very robust,” sits on that council. At a gathering of the council on the Wednesday after the floods (at which Abbott was absent), Noem reiterated her desire to see FEMA “eliminated as it existed” and “remade.” The council's recommendations are due in November.

 The administration does seem to understand that its plans to rapidly remake FEMA have real drawbacks. Noem has retained FEMA employees who looked like they'd be let go; Trump said last month that he intends to phase out FEMA only after this hurricane season. But reporting in recent days suggests that the administration is softening its tone on FEMA even further, at least for the moment. The Washington Post reports that the promised dissolution may in fact look more like a “rebranding.” Reality sets in fast in a disaster.

Waltz publicly questioned for the first time about the 'Signal-gate' incident —where he accidentally added a journalist to a private Signal military chat.

Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is poised to face members of the Senate Tuesday to get the ball rolling on his nomination to represent the U.S. at the United Nations.

Waltz's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee comes months after he exited his job at the White House amid controversy surrounding his role in a Signal group chat with other top administration officials. 

Waltz is expected to call for reforms at the U.N. and is expected to say that it's time to redirect the organization's focus back to peacekeeping, according to his opening statement shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. Waltz's statement says that the U.S. has footed the bill for missions that have endured for decades, and amount to nation-building rather than peacekeeping. 

Likewise, Waltz is expected to promise to turn up the heat on countering China and vow to work with the State Department to mitigate Chinese influence. 

"Countering China is critical," a draft of Waltz's statement says. "It's absurd that the world's second-largest economy is treated as a developing nation throughout UN agencies that gives China favorable status."

Waltz's prepared remarks also urge weeding out "pervasive" antisemitism in the U.N., and claims that the U.N. passed "154 resolutions against Israel versus 71 against all other nations combined."

Additionally, Waltz's statement calls for slimming down the U.N. with staff cuts, due to an overlap in missions and "wasteful" resources throughout the U.N.'s more than 80 agencies. 

"It's worth remembering that, even with cuts, the US is by far the most generous nation in the world," Waltz's draft statement says. 

Democrats vowed to grill Waltz during his confirmation process in the aftermath of the Atlantic magazine's reporting about a Signal group chat that his team had set up to discuss strikes against the Houthis in March.

Even so, the tough questioning from Democrats on the so-called "Signalgate" issue isn't expected to derail Waltz's confirmation to the post, given that Republicans hold a 53–47 majority in the Senate. 

"It's all theater — you know he's going to get confirmed," a GOP foreign relations source told Fox News Digital. "If Signalgate's a big thing against him, it wasn't enough to get anyone else fired or impeached or anything like that." 

SENATE DEMOCRATS PREDICTING ‘BRUTAL' UN AMBASSADOR CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR MIKE WALTZ

Waltz, a former congressman who represented Florida's 6th congressional district, is a retired Army National Guard colonel and former Green Beret. During his time in uniform, he served four deployments to Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars — the fourth-highest military combat award, issued for heroic service against an armed enemy.

Waltz and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth were both entangled in the Signal chat that Waltz's team created where members of the Trump administration discussed strike plans against the Houthis. 

Waltz in March said he took "full responsibility" for the Signal group chat, and the Trump administration has maintained that no war plans were shared in the chat. The Atlantic published the full exchange of messages, which included certain attack details such as specific aircraft and times of the strikes from Hegseth. 

On May 1, President Donald Trump announced Waltz's departure from his role as national security advisor and hours later unveiled the former Florida congressman's nomination to represent the U.S. at the U.N. 

Democrats called for Hegseth's resignation as a result of the chat and warned that Waltz would face the heat during the confirmation process for U.N. ambassador. 

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a May interview with CBS News that Waltz could count on a "brutal, brutal hearing" from senators, and described his nomination as "failing up." 

"He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in this Signal chain," Duckworth, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CBS News. 

Duckworth, who served in the Illinois Army National Guard as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot and lost both of her legs during a 2004 deployment to Iraq, told Fox News Digital Monday that Waltz's involvement in the group chat should disqualify him from serving as U.N. ambassador. She also said that every official included in the chat should be fired. 

"As a retired Soldier, Waltz should have shut the unclassified chain down as soon as he saw Hegseth share such classified information that could've gotten our pilots killed," Duckworth said in a statement. "It's clear Waltz cannot be trusted to make critical and sensitive national security decisions, and I look forward to pressing him on his conduct and holding him accountable."

NEXT US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR? HERE'S WHOM TRUMP MIGHT PICK TO REPLACE WALTZ 

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., said that Mike Waltz's involvement in the Signal group chat leak should disqualify him from serving as U.N. ambassador. 

Duckworth has pinned most of the blame on Hegseth for Signalgate. Prior to Trump's announcement on Waltz's U.N. ambassador nomination, Duckworth said in a May post on X that of "all the idiots in that chat, Hegseth is the biggest security risk of all — he leaked the info that put our troops in greater danger." 

In addition to Waltz and Hegseth, administration officials including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were part of the group chat. 

Additionally, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Chris Coons, D-Conn., said that Waltz could brace for a meticulous confirmation hearing before the committee's members. 

"I look forward to a thorough confirmation hearing," Coons said in a post on X in May. 

A spokesperson for Coons did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

The GOP foreign relations source described the fallout from Signalgate a "huge nothing burger," and pointed out that Democrats' previous efforts to use Signalgate against Waltz and Hegseth have proven unsuccessful. 

"If this was their deathly bullet, it would have killed Hegseth, and it would have killed Waltz, but they're both left standing," the source told Fox News Digital. 

A Senate aide told Fox News Digital that while Waltz took the brunt of the blame for Signalgate because his team created the chat, Democrats' expected questioning of the group chat during the hearing is actually about finding a new avenue to go after Trump. 

"I don't think he's the target. He's just the mechanism to go after the target," the Senate aide said. "At the end of the day, Democrats want to criticize and go after the president, so these guys are just a mechanism to get there." 

Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have voiced support for Waltz, with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, calling him a "great choice" for the position in a post on X in May. Additionally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at the time that the Senate would "for sure" confirm Waltz. 

"Some things I know for sure: the sun rises in the East, sets in the West and Mike Waltz will be confirmed as the next UN Ambassador," Graham said in an X post in May. "He is highly qualified, well-positioned, and will be a strong voice for our nation at the UN."

Since Waltz's departure as serving as national security advisor, Rubio has stepped in to fill that role.

Trump previously nominated Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to represent the U.S. at the U.N. However, her nomination was pulled in March, and Trump claimed at the time that the House could not give up another Republican seat with its slim 220–212 Republican majority. 

If confirmed as U.N. ambassador, Waltz would be responsible for representing U.S. interests at the U.N.'s New York headquarters, weighing in on resolutions, treaties and other global matters.  

Waltz could not be reached for comment by Fox News Digital.

The 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly is scheduled for Sept. 9, providing a window of time for Waltz's nomination to make it through the entire confirmation process beforehand. 

"The hope is to have him in place before the U.N. General Assembly is in session," the GOP foreign relations source told Fox News Digital.

            Relatives of an Indian nurse on death row in war-torn Yemen are racing against time to commute her death sentence, in a case that has gripped India's media.
    


            Nimisha Priya was sentenced to death for the murder of her former business partner, a Yemeni national, whose body was discovered in a water tank in 2017.
    


            Her execution was initially scheduled for Wednesday, but Indian government sources said on Tuesday she had been given a last minute reprieve.
    


            She was given the death penalty by a court in capital Sanaa in 2020 and her family has been fighting for her release since, complicated by the lack of formal ties between New Delhi and the Houthis, who have controlled the city since the country's civil war broke out in 2014.
    


            India's media has devoted significant coverage to the case and human rights groups have called on the Houthis not to carry it out.
    


            Amnesty International on Monday urged the Houthis to “establish a moratorium on all executions and commute (Priya's) and all existing death sentences as first steps.”
    


            It added: “The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.”
    


            Priya's mother Prema Kumari, a domestic laborer from Kerala, who sold her home to fund her daughter's legal fees, has been in Yemen for more than one year to facilitate negotiations for her release.
    


            She last saw Priya on June 18, she told CNN. “She looked tense,” Kumar said through tears.
    


            In accordance with Yemen's Islamic laws, Priya could be given clemency if the victim's family pardon her and accept her family's donation of “diyah”, often dubbed blood money, according to Samuel Joseph, a social worker assisting her family in the case.
    


            “I am optimistic,” said Joseph, an Indian who has lived in Yemen since 1999.
    


            “I'm spiriting the efforts here, and by god's grace, we got people who are helping. The government of India is directly involved and there's nothing more I can say at this point of time,” he told CNN.
    


            The Indian government sources said Tuesday the government has “made concerted efforts in recent days to seek more time for the family of Ms. Nimishapriya to reach a mutually agreeable solution with the other party.”
    


            “Despite the sensitivities involved, Indian officials have been in regular touch with the local jail authorities and the prosecutor's office, leading to securing this postponement.”
    


            Priya allegedly injected her business partner with a fatal overdose of sedatives, Joseph said. Her family maintain she was acting in self-defense and that her business partner was abusive and kept her passport from her after the country's civil war broke out.
    


            Her trial was held in Arabic and she was not provided with a translator, Joseph said.
    


            A group of activists and lawyers founded the Save Nimisha Priya Action Council in 2020 to raise money for Priya's release and negotiate with the victim's family.
    


            “Negotiations have been a challenge,” said Rafeek Ravuthar, an activist and member of the council. “The reality is that there is no Indian embassy, there is no mission in this country.”
    


            Rafeeq said about five million rupees (nearly $58,000) has been raised so far.
    


            In recent days, politicians from her home state of Kerala have requested India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and help secure Priya's release.
    


            “Considering the fact this is a case deserving sympathy, I appeal to the Hon'ble Prime Minister to take up the matter,” Kerala's chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote in a letter to Modi.
    


            In February, Kirti Vardhan Singh, India's Minister of State for External Affairs told the upper house of parliament that the government “accords the highest priority for the welfare of Indians abroad and provides all possible support to those who fall in distress including in the instant case.”
    


            He added: “Government of India is providing all possible assistance in the case. The matter regarding any consideration towards the release of Ms. Nimisha Priya is between the family of the deceased and Ms. Nimisha Priya's family.”
    


            CNN has contacted India's foreign ministry for comment.
    


            Priya first arrived in Yemen in 2008, joining the ranks of more than two million people from Kerala who have sought better livelihoods across the Middle East.
    


            She found work as a nurse in a local hospital, nurturing hopes of establishing her own clinic and building a more secure future for her young daughter and husband, according to campaigners from the Save Nimisha Priya Council. Yemeni regulations, however, required foreign nationals to partner with a local to open a business.
    


            With the support of her husband, Priya borrowed from family and friends and in 2014 opened a clinic in Sanaa.
    


            “We lived a normal happy married life,” her husband Tomy Thomas told CNN. “My wife was very loving, hardworking and faithful in all that she did.”
    


            But her aspirations were soon overshadowed by the political conflict and turmoil that has beset Yemen for decades.
    


            That same year, Houthi rebels seized the capital, ousting the internationally recognized Saudi-backed government. By 2015, the unrest had escalated into a devastating civil war, leaving the country fractured and unstable.
    


            For foreign nationals, the deteriorating security situation made Yemen an increasingly perilous place to live and work. Many chose to evacuate, but Priya decided to remain. Those supporting her family say that she stayed on, determined to salvage the life and business she had worked hard to build.
    


            India does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with the Houthis, nor does it have an operational embassy in Yemen. All consular and diplomatic affairs related to the country are instead handled through the Indian Embassy in Djibouti, across the Red Sea.
    


            CNN has contacted the Indian embassy in Djibouti.
    


            For those working to save Priya, that meant navigating complex communication channels and facing additional hurdles in seeking help, legal aid, or protection while stranded in a nation still wracked by conflict and instability.
    


            Yemen was among the top five countries in 2024 with the highest number of executions, according to Amnesty International.
    


            Amnesty said it confirmed the Houthis carried out at least one execution in areas they control in 2024 but added that it was possible more took place.
    


            Priya's mother, Kumari, said she was “grateful for everyone's support,” adding she is happy has been able to see Priya over the course of this year.
    


            Priya's husband and daughter remain in Kerala, hopeful for her release.
    


            “My wife is very good, she is very loving,” Thomas said. “That is the sole reason I am with her, supporting her and will do so till the end.”

            China reported better-than-expected economic growth for the second quarter in the face of an ongoing trade war with the United States, as diversification efforts to non-US markets buoyed exports.
    


            Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 5.2% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) at a press conference on Tuesday. That was higher than the average prediction of 5.1%, based on a poll of 40 economists surveyed by Reuters on Friday.
    


            The GDP growth in the second quarter was a slowdown from a 5.4% expansion in the first three months of the year. Together, GDP growth for the first half of the year compared to the same period last year stood at 5.3%, according to the NBS.
    


            Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the NBS, said the growth in the first half of the year was achieved “under the challenging circumstances of rapidly shifting international dynamics and significantly increased external pressure since the second quarter.”
    


            “We are also keenly aware that the external environment remains complex and volatile, internal structural problems have yet to be fundamentally resolved, and the foundation of economic performance still needs to be further strengthened,” he said.
    


            China's economy remains under mounting external and internal pressure to meet its ambitious target of “around 5%” growth set for this year, a goal economists believe will be tough to achieve without further policy support.
    


            US President Donald Trump's tariff offensive – which at one point reached 145% on Chinese imports – has upended what is arguably the world's most consequential bilateral trade relationship. Under a May truce reached in Geneva﻿ that scaled back the triple-digit tariffs, Beijing has less than a month, until August 12, to secure a permanent deal with Washington.
    


            For China's export-reliant economy, much hinges on the tariff rate ultimately agreed upon. Even a double-digit levy would carry profound and lasting implications for Chinese manufacturers – a key pillar of the country's economic engine.
    


            Domestically, the Chinese economy continues to be plagued by a host of structural challenges, including a prolonged property crisis, soaring youth unemployment, sluggish consumption and persistent deflation.
    


            In June, consumer spending fell short of expectations while industrial production exceeded them, according to data released by the NBS Tuesday. Retail sales slowed to 4.8% from the same month last year, compared with 6.4% growth in May. Industrial output expanded 6.8% compared with June last year, an increase from 5.8% last month, likely due to the trade truce.
    


            Meanwhile, the housing market is slowing again, weighing on the economy after a brief recovery following late last year's stimulus, Macquarie Group's chief China economist Larry Hu wrote in a Wednesday research note. Investment in the sector plunged 11.2% in the first six months compared with the same period last year, according to NBS data.
    


            Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNN that while the trade war has dragged on market sentiment, it hasn't emerged as the massive shock to Chinese economic performance that investors initially feared back in April.
    


            With weaknesses in the domestic economy, such as weak consumer confidence and persistent stress in the property sector, however, he expects China to barely undershoot its annual target for this year.
    


            But Marro also cautioned that there is a mismatch between what the GDP figure says and what companies and households are seeing on the ground.
    


            “For many, this doesn't ‘feel' like an economy growing at around 5% – That sentiment factor has implications for how sustainable future retail spending is, as well as considerations for businesses about future investment expansions, as well as hiring and wage growth,” he said.
    


            Despite growth in the first half of the year exceeding the 5% target, economists warned that existing obstacles could weigh on exports and slow economic momentum in the months ahead.
    


            Zichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a Tuesday research note that the economic outlook for the rest of the year remains “challenging.”
    


            “With tariffs set to remain high, fiscal ammunition being depleted and structural headwinds persisting, growth is likely to slow further over the second half,” he said.
    


            In June, China's manufacturers capitalized on the trade truce with the US and diversified their supply routes to achieve a 5.8% growth in overall export compared to the same month in the previous year, beating analysts' forecast, according to trade data released on Monday by China's General Administration of Customs. At the same time, imports edged up 1.1%, marking the first monthly increase in inbound shipments since February.
    


            Notably, exports of rare earth jumped 32% in June from the same month a year ago, signaling positive progress as China agreed to approve the flow of the critical elements essential in everything from electronic products to vehicles and fighter jets following talks in London with the US last month.
    


            Outbound shipments to the US in June declined 16.1% from the same month last year due to persistent trade frictions. But exports last month grew 32% month-on-month following the Geneva agreement. For the first half of the year, exports to the US dropped 9.9% from a year earlier, with second-quarter shipments plummeting nearly 21%.
    


            Southeast Asia in particular has emerged as a major export destination in place of the US. Exports to the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) surged by over 18% compared with June last year. China has increasingly turned to neighboring economies not only as end markets but also as logistical intermediaries, routing goods through countries like Vietnam to circumvent US tariffs — a strategy the Trump Administration has vowed to crack down.
    


            As part of a trade framework the US reached with Vietnam, Trump said he will impose a 40% duty on transshipped imports via Vietnam. Chinese exports to Vietnam rose more than 25% last month compared with June last year.
    


            At a press conference on Thursday, Chinese officials touted how the country has diversified its “circle of friends” with a rise in exports to the European Union, South Korea, Japan in addition to ASEAN in the first half of the year.
    


            Within China, the economy continues to grapple with deflationary pressure, as factory gate deflation, as measured by Producer Price Index (PPI), plunged 3.6% in June from a year earlier, according to NBS data released last week. This marks its sharpest decline in nearly two years, and extends the country's producer deflation streak to 33 consecutive months.
    


            Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a benchmark for measuring inflation, rose 0.1% compared to the same month last year, ending a four-month decline.
    


            Deflation is problematic because it discourages people from spending now, in anticipation of lower prices in the future. This dampens consumption – a key driver of economic growth.
    


            Analysts attributed the uptick in consumer prices to government subsidies on consumer goods, and warned that the recovery may be short-lived as stimulus effects fade.
    


            The persistent deflationary pressure is squeezing business profits and wages, and it has been exacerbated by price wars and overcapacity such as in the auto industry. Authorities have grown increasingly concerned and have urged companies to end aggressive discounting.
    


            In response to the economic malaise and external challenges like tariffs, China's cabinet, the State Council on Wednesday unveiled a slew of measures to “stabilize employment,” including expanding social insurance coverage, subsidies, loan support and vocational training for targeted groups such as youths.
    


            China's urban unemployment rate stood at 5% in June, below the government's annual target of 5.5%, according to the NBS on Tuesday. But youth unemployment remained a major problem.
    


            The unemployment rate for China's working population aged 16 to 24 remained elevated at 14.9% in May, despite falling to its lowest level in nearly a year. The figure for those aged 25 to 29 declined to 7% during the same period.
    


            As part of the new measures announced, the government will disburse a one-off subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan ($209) per person to companies and social organizations that hire unemployed youth aged 16 to 24 and pay for their full insurance for at least three months, the notice said.
    


            The State Council also directed local authorities to provide graduates struggling to find jobs with one-on-one support, including at least three job recommendations. After graduation, those still unemployed would receive continued support like policy briefings, career guidance, job leads, and training or internship opportunities, the notice said.

            Colorado prosecutors are set to lay out their evidence Tuesday against a man charged with murder, attempted murder and other crimes in a firebomb attack on demonstrators showing their support for Israeli hostages in Gaza.
    


            Investigators say Mohamed Sabry Soliman told them he intended to kill the roughly 20 participants at the weekly demonstration on Boulder's Pearl Street pedestrian mall on June 1. But he threw just two of more than two dozen Molotov cocktails he had with him while yelling, “Free Palestine!” Police said he told them he got scared because he had never hurt anyone before.
    


            Federal authorities say Soliman, an Egyptian national, had been living in the U.S. illegally with his family.
    


            The purpose of Tuesday's preliminary hearing in state court in Boulder is for District Judge Nancy Woodruff Salomone to determine if there's enough evidence for Soliman to go on trial there.
    


Judge ends order blocking deportation of family of man charged in Boulder firebomb attack



            Soliman already faced dozens of charges in state court as well as hate crime charges in federal court when state prosecutors added murder charges following the death of an 82-year-old woman who was injured in the attack died as the result of her injuries. Karen Diamond helped at her synagogue and volunteered for several local groups, including the University of Colorado University Women's Club and a local music festival.
    


            Last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Cramer-Babycz told U.S. District Judge John L. Kane that federal prosecutors have not decided yet whether to file additional charges against Soliman related to Diamond's death.
    


            Federal prosecutors allege the victims were targeted because of their perceived or actual connection to Israel. But Soliman's federal defense lawyers say he should not have been charged with hate crimes because the evidence shows he was motivated by opposition to Zionism, the political movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel.
    


            An attack motivated by someone's political views is not considered a hate crime under federal law.
    


            Soliman has pleaded not guilty to the hate crime charges. He has not been asked to enter a plea to the state charges yet.
    


Judge says hate crime prosecution in Boulder, Colorado, attack can proceed



            State prosecutors have identified 29 people who are considered victims of the attack, including 13 who were physically injured. The others were nearby and are considered victims because they could have been hurt. A dog was also injured in the attack, so Soliman has also been charged with animal cruelty.
    


            Tuesday's hearing was set to move ahead over the objections of Soliman's state public defenders, who asked to delay it after Diamond died and Soliman was charged with murder. In a court filing last week, they said they were not aware of an autopsy report being done for Diamond yet and asked to delay the hearing until October so they would be be able to review “significant medical records” in advance.

            These days, travel between the harbor cities of Hong Kong and Macao takes an hour by high-speed ferry. But from 1948 to 1961, when the two were still colonies of European powers, wealthy tourists could opt for a brief trip by air.
    


            Miss Macao was not a beauty queen. She was a Consolidated Model 28 Catalina seaplane that whisked travelers from Portuguese-controlled Macao to British-controlled Hong Kong, a 20-minute trip. These jaunts were called “cigarette flights,” since the duration was about the length of time needed to smoke one — and you could, since there were no rules against smoking on planes.
    


            Back then, getting on a plane “was like taking a bus,” says Dan Porat, a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. If they could afford it, passengers could buy their tickets as they boarded the plane, with no need to book in advance.
    


            The Macau Air Transport Company, a now-defunct branch of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific flagship airline, operated two of these Catalina “flying boats.” As Macao didn't have an airport or land cleared for a runway, the planes could take off from its coastal waters.
    


            Flying became a popular option for businessmen going between the two cities, especially those who were bringing in items like gold, since Macao was the only open gold market in East Asia at the time.

            But then, on July 16, 1948, Miss Macao failed to arrive at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport. Officials in Hong Kong quickly sounded the alarm, and local police began searching the waters between the two cities.



            The only survivor, a 24-year-old Chinese rice farmer named Wong Yu, was rescued by a fisherman and taken to the hospital in Macao. According to multiple news reports at the time, one of Wong's legs was broken, and he was wearing a life jacket he'd managed to grab as the plane descended.
    


            Although Wong claimed to be an ordinary passenger and explained that the plane had exploded in midair, inconsistencies in his story and his questionable behavior — including trying to escape from the hospital — led authorities and the press to a different explanation: The Miss Macao crashed into the sea while being taken over by “air pirates,” an incident that the China Mail, a Hong Kong English-language newspaper, called “unparalleled in the history of aviation.”
    


            On the day it last took off, Miss Macao had two pilots in the cockpit: American captain Dale Cramer and Australian first officer Ken McDuff, both former military airmen. In total, there were 27 people on board: along with 24 passengers, there was a single flight attendant, Delca da Costa, a Portuguese national from Macao who was also McDuff's girlfriend.
    


            Four of the passengers, though, had no intention of going to Hong Kong. In a confession, Wong said that he and three fellow would-be thieves had sold everything they owned to buy the tickets, figuring that the proceeds from the crime would be worth it.
    


            As historian Luis Andrade de Sa explains in his book “Aviation in Macau: One Hundred Years of Adventure,” shortly after the plane took off from Macao, the four hijackers quickly sprang into action, with one storming into the cockpit and demanding that the pilots surrender control of the aircraft.
    


            According to multiple historical accounts, the lead hijacker, Chiu Tok, had taken flying lessons in Manila and planned to take over captaining the plane once the pilots were subdued.
    


            However, he hadn't anticipated that Cramer would refuse to let go of the controls, nor that there would be resistance in the main cabin. As one passenger tussled with a hijacker, a gun went off. McDuff swung at Chiu Tok with an iron bar. The hijackers shot both pilots, and Cramer's body landed on the plane's joystick control, sending the aircraft plummeting into the South China Sea.
    


            An August 1948 article in Time magazine described the scene in colorful language, writing that the four hijackers “looked hungrily” at the rich passengers they were targeting.
    


            Wong was picked up by a local boat and treated for his injuries. His story about surviving a midair explosion was quickly disproven when pieces of Miss Macao's wreckage were recovered, punctured by bullet holes.
    


            Getting the true account of events out of Wong wouldn't be easy. He was in poor physical and mental health, so police were reluctant to use harsh interrogation. Instead, they came up with an unorthodox plan: they filled the hospital with sleeper agents. Dozens of Chinese-speaking undercover police officers posing as patients were tasked with befriending Wong, and they eventually got him to admit what really happened on board Miss Macao.
    


            He confessed that the plan had been for the hijackers to seize control of the plane and redirect it to a town in Guangdong province in southern China, where the passengers and crew would be robbed of their valuables and then held for ransom.
    


            No one was supposed to die.
    


            The hijacking of the Miss Macao was so novel that no one had ever applied the word “hijacking” to such a situation — press at the time called it “air piracy.”
    


            The concept of scanning passengers with a metal detector before they boarded a plane was still decades away. Only the most cursory of security checks were carried out, with some items of luggage opened and searched.
    


            The hijackers had prepared for that — they'd tied their guns to their legs with black string, and the China Mail newspaper reported at the time that one had hidden bullets in the hollowed-out sole of his shoe.
    


            Although Wong eventually told the full story of what happened on board Miss Macao, there was confusion over how to prosecute him — and who would do it. Portuguese authorities in Macao said that because the plane was owned by a British company, Wong's trial would need to take place in Hong Kong. But because the hijackers were all Chinese, British officials in Hong Kong said the case was not in their jurisdiction either.
    


            Finally, in 1951, Wong was deported from Macao to mainland China, where he died not long after, at the age of 27. He never stood trial for robbery, murder or piracy.

            As for the two former colonial cities, their own air travel industries blossomed in the decades to come.
    


            Hong Kong became one of the world's biggest air hubs as its economy grew in the late 20th century. The city became a financial capital and the gateway to mainland China.
    


            It outgrew Kai Tak Airport, which closed in 1998 and was replaced with the larger Hong Kong International, which is consistently ranked among the best airports in the world.
    


            Meanwhile, Macao International Airport opened in 1995. These days, the airport has a small exhibit about important aviation stories that happened there — including the hijacking of the Miss Macao.
    


            The story of the Hong Kong-Macao hijacking quickly fell out of newspapers. Many people in the nascent commercial aviation industry saw it as a terrible one-off and didn't believe that plane hijacking — or skyjacking as it was called at the peak of its popularity — would become commonplace. There was also a fear that too much coverage of the story would scare off would-be flyers.
    


            When the United States established the Federal Aviation Administration in 1958 to regulate air travel, the legislation made no mention of preventing skyjacking, a sign that it was still not seen as a significant issue. But the social unrest of the years that followed, and the growth and increasing affordability of air travel, changed all that, historians say.
    


            From 1968 to 1972, the airlines went through what became known as the “golden age of hijacking,” a phrase popularized by Brendan I. Koerner in his book “The Skies Belong to Us.”
    


            “Every five and a half days, there was a hijacking,” says Porat, the history professor. “This is the time where the industry is trying to develop. And basically, (hijacking) becomes a threat.”
    


            Some of the incidents followed the same plan as the Miss Macao incident — a group of hijackers would take over the plane, land it in a third location, rob the prisoners, and hold the passengers and/or the plane for ransom.

            Other hijackers claimed political reasons for taking over airplanes, demanding passage to North Vietnam, Algeria or Cuba, all of which were at odds with the United States. It happened the other way in a few cases, too. Individuals from countries behind the Iron Curtain — often members of the flight crew — would demand to be flown to a non-communist nation where they could claim political asylum.
    


            Hijacking became so common that airline head offices kept large amounts of cash on hand in case they needed to fork it over to a would-be hijacker, Koerner explains in his book.
    


            William Landes, a US economist and emeritus professor at the University of Chicago Law School, estimates that during this so-called “golden age,” hijackings cost the aviation industry $219,221 per passenger.
    


            According to Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Porat, the hijacking of a 1968 plane by Palestinian militants was “largely agreed upon in scholarly circles to be the first international act of international terrorism (via) the hijacking of a plane.”
    


            Three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took over El Al Flight 426, which was traveling from Rome to Israel, and diverted the plane to Algeria. The non-Israeli passengers and crew were allowed to leave and board a plane to France, while 40 male Israelis were held for 40 days before being released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
    


            Although everyone on board El Al 426 survived, skyjackings had become too big to ignore. The cost to airlines was astronomical, and industry executives were fed up.
    


            As Koerner puts it, “By the end of 1972, the skyjackers had become so reckless, so dismissive of human life, that the airlines and the federal government had no choice but to turn every airport into a miniature police state.”
    


            Porat agrees. Although there was initially pushback from travelers, there had been enough high-profile hijackings that safety had become a significant concern. And they acquiesced, agreeing to walk through metal detectors, have their luggage X-rayed, and more.
    


            “We're so used to this being searched thing that it's quite incredible,” Porat says.

            In 1970, the UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, a multilateral agreement to proscribe and punish the hijacking of planes, was approved at The Hague.
    


            It called hijackings “a matter of grave concern,” adding that “unlawful acts of seizure or exercise of control of aircraft in flight jeopardize the safety of persons and property, seriously affect the operation of air services, and undermine the confidence of the peoples of the world in the safety of civil aviation.”
    


            In 1971, US President Richard Nixon appointed Lt. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. the country's first — and so far only — “hijacking czar.” Davis wanted to impose strict screening procedures at airports but was met with pushback from the aviation industry, which believed that passengers would balk at the rules and give up on air travel.
    


            Still, in 1973, Nixon introduced mandatory metal detector screenings for all passengers in the United States and X-rays for all bags. And the 9/11 attacks, closely followed by the attempted bombing of a Paris-to-Miami flight with explosives hidden in a shoe, brought on the familiar grueling security checks of today — none of which, for all the industry's fears in the Nixon era, discouraged the public from flying.
    


            What happened on the Miss Macao was not a singular story. It was the first of many aviation incidents that would transform the way humans travel by air. Before “the golden age of hijacking” or the September 11, 2001 attacks, one nearly forgotten seaplane set a new age of aviation into motion.

Florida‘s attorney general speculated that weather modification technology could have played a role in the deadly Texas flash floods.

On Monday, James Uthmeier wrote a letter to all public-use airports in the state, warning against any geoengineering or weather modification technology, which the state had recently banned. Most notable, however, was a line in the letter in which the Republican attorney general speculated that “cloud seeding” technology could have played a role in the Texas floods that have killed 132 people and left 101 missing.

“As our hearts break for the victims of the flash floods in Texas, I can't help but notice the possibility that weather modification could have played a role in this tragedy,” Uthmeier wrote. “Developing reports show that a weather modification company conducted ‘cloud seeding' operations just days before the deadly flood.”

“Florida's new law seeks to prevent anything like that from ever happening,” he added.

Uthmeier referred to concerns over a 20-minute cloud seeding mission by Rainmaker Technology Corporation on July 2 over Karnes County, southeast of the flood zone. Two clouds were targeted and dissipated later that day. RTC CEO Augustus Doricko produced documents showing no further missions were carried out on July 3-4, with the floods starting on July 4.

The mission triggered conspiracy theories that the mission played a role in triggering the flash floods, which shocked the public with its spontaneity and ferocity. Doricko posted a detailed thread on X, inviting any scrutiny but undercutting allegations that his company had any role in the floods.

“Natural clouds typically have lifespans of 30 minutes to a few hours at most, with even the most persistent storm systems rarely maintaining the same cloud structure for more than 12-18 hours. The clouds that were seeded on July 2nd dissipated over 24 hours prior to the developing storm complex that would produce the flooding rainfall,” he wrote.

Doricko also released a detailed meteorological report around the mission.

Meteorologists and other experts cast heavy doubt on claims that the mission could have had any role in the Texas floods. 

Veteran Houston meteorologist Travis Herzog with ABC 13 argued against the theory, arguing that there was no scientific evidence for it. He pointed out that floods of the July 4 type are rare but had ample precedent long before cloud seeding technology was created. The unique terrain of the affected area, combined with remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Barry and Hurricane Flossie, produced a deadly combo.

“Due to the hilly terrain, when high amounts of rain fall in a short period of time, the water flows quickly through the creek and river valleys, sometimes with devastating and deadly consequences like we are witnessing on this July 4th holiday weekend. (See also the Blanco River flood in Wimberley on Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Canyon Lake flood in July 2002, or the Guadalupe River flood in July 1987 for some of the more recent examples.),” He wrote in a post on Facebook.

He argued that cloud seeding technology can't produce the significant rainfall needed to trigger the flash floods.

“Cloud seeding cannot create a storm of this magnitude or size. In fact, cloud seeding cannot even create a single cloud,” Herzog wrote. “All it can do is take an existing cloud and enhance the rainfall by up to 20%, and even that is on the high end.”

He added that “it is physically impossible for that to have created this weather system. This is a matter of scale. If I blow out a candle with my breath, does that mean I can then go blow out a raging wildfire? It is the same with cloud-seeding.”

Herzog also countered conspiracy theories from the other side, which claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency cuts to the National Weather Service hindered its forecast and warning operations. He wrote that his analysis found that the weather service had issued timely warnings as the events unfolded and that he saw no evidence that any cuts “hurt the situation.”

Federal workers warned for months that the high-energy biscuits would go to waste.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Five months into its unprecedented dismantling of foreign-aid programs, the Trump administration has given the order to incinerate food instead of sending it to people abroad who need it. Nearly 500 metric tons of emergency food—enough to feed about 1.5 million children for a week—are set to expire tomorrow, according to current and former government employees with direct knowledge of the rations. Within weeks, two of those sources told me, the food, meant for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, will be ash. (The sources I spoke with for this story requested anonymity for fear of professional repercussions.)

Sometime near the end of the Biden administration, USAID spent about $800,000 on the high-energy biscuits, one current and one former employee at the agency told me. The biscuits, which cram in the nutritional needs of a child under 5, are a stopgap measure, often used in scenarios where people have lost their homes in a natural disaster or fled a war faster than aid groups could set up a kitchen to receive them. They were stored in a Dubai warehouse and intended to go to the children this year.

Since January, when the Trump administration issued an executive order that halted virtually all American foreign assistance, federal workers have sent the new political leaders of USAID repeated requests to ship the biscuits while they were useful, according to the two USAID employees. USAID bought the biscuits intending to have the World Food Programme distribute them, and under previous circumstances, career staff could have handed off the biscuits to the United Nations agency on their own. But since Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency disbanded USAID and the State Department subsumed the agency, no money or aid items can move without the approval of the new heads of American foreign assistance, several current and former USAID employees told me. From January to mid-April, the responsibility rested with Pete Marocco, who worked across multiple agencies during the first Trump administration; then it passed to Jeremy Lewin, a law-school graduate in his 20s who was originally installed by DOGE and now has appointments at both USAID and State. Two of the USAID employees told me that staffers who sent the memos requesting approval to move the food never got a response and did not know whether Marocco or Lewin ever received them. (The State Department did not answer my questions about why the food was never distributed.)

In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told representatives on the House Appropriations Committee that he would ensure that food aid would reach its intended recipients before spoiling. But by then, the order to incinerate the biscuits (which I later reviewed) had already been sent. Rubio has insisted that the administration embraces America's responsibility to continue saving foreign lives, including through food aid. But in April, according to NPR, the U.S. government eliminated all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Yemen, where, the State Department said at the time, providing food risks benefiting terrorists. (The State Department has offered no similar justification for pulling aid to Pakistan.) Even if the administration was unwilling to send the biscuits to the originally intended countries, other places—Sudan, say, where war is fueling the world's worst famine in decades—could have benefited. Instead, the biscuits in the Dubai warehouse continue to approach their expiration date, after which their vitamin and fat content will begin to deteriorate rapidly. At this point, United Arab Emirates policy prevents the biscuits from even being repurposed as animal feed.

Over the coming weeks, the food will be destroyed at a cost of $130,000 to American taxpayers (on top of the $800,000 used to purchase the biscuits), according to current and former federal aid workers I spoke with. One current USAID staffer told me he'd never seen anywhere near this many biscuits trashed over his decades working in American foreign aid. Sometimes food isn't stored properly in warehouses, or a flood or a terrorist group complicates deliveries; that might result in, at most, a few dozen tons of fortified foods being lost in a given year. But several of the aid workers I spoke with reiterated that they have never before seen the U.S. government simply give up on food that could have been put to good use.

The emergency biscuits slated for destruction represent only a small fraction of America's typical annual investment in food aid. In fiscal year 2023, USAID purchased more than 1 million metric tons of food from U.S. producers. But the collapse of American foreign aid raises the stakes of every loss. Typically, the biscuits are the first thing that World Food Programme workers hand to Afghan families who are being forced out of Pakistan and back to their home country, which has been plagued by severe child malnutrition for years. Now the WFP can support only one of every 10 Afghans who are in urgent need of food assistance. The WFP projects that, globally, 58 million people are at risk for extreme hunger or starvation because this year, it lacks the money to feed them. Based on calculations from one of the current USAID employees I spoke with, the food marked for destruction could have met the nutritional needs of every child facing acute food insecurity in Gaza for a week.

Despite the administration's repeated promises to continue food aid, and Rubio's testimony that he would not allow existing food to go to waste, even more food could soon expire. Hundreds of thousands of boxes of emergency food pastes, also already purchased, are currently collecting dust in American warehouses. According to USAID inventory lists from January, more than 60,000 metric tons of food—much of it grown in America, and all already purchased by the U.S. government—were then sitting in warehouses across the world. That included 36,000 pounds of peas, oil, and cereal, which were stored in Djibouti and intended for distribution in Sudan and other countries in the Horn of Africa. A former senior official at USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance told me that, by the time she'd left her job earlier this month, very little of the food seemed to have moved; one of the current USAID employees I spoke with confirmed her impression, though he noted that, in recent weeks, small shipments have begun leaving the Djibouti warehouse.

Such operations are more difficult for USAID to manage today than they were last year because many of the humanitarian workers and supply-chain experts who once coordinated the movement of American-grown food to hungry people around the world no longer have their jobs. Last month, the CEOs of the two American companies that make another kind of emergency food for malnourished children both told The New York Times that the government seemed unsure of how to ship the food it had already purchased. Nor, they told me, have they received any new orders. (A State Department spokesperson told me that the department had recently approved additional purchases, but both CEOs told me they have yet to receive the orders. The State Department has not responded to further questions about these purchases.) But even if the Trump administration decides tomorrow to buy more food aid—or simply distribute what the government already owns while the food is still useful—it may no longer have the capacity to make sure anyone receives it.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do. 

But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans.




“The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov's data,” NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said.

On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said, “All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting.”

“This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments.




Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here.

Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports. 

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said. “In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology.”

“They simply don't want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,” Holdren said in an email.

That's why it's important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is “useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment.”

“Trump doesn't want people to know,” Holdren wrote. 

The most recent report, issued in 2023, found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority communities, particularly Native Americans, often disproportionately at risk.

            Thousands of employees across US federal health agencies received an email Monday afternoon telling them they were out of a job as of the close of business.
    


            The firings were originally communicated April 1 for most of the included employees, but they'd been delayed as a legal battle played out. That culminated in a US Supreme Court decision July 8 that, the US Department of Health and Human Services said in the email, means the agency “is now permitted to move forward with a portion of its [reduction in force].”
    


            “You are hereby notified that you are officially separated from HHS at the close of business on July 14, 2025,” read Monday's notice to dismissed HHS employees, according to copies obtained by CNN. “Thank you for your service to the American people.”
    


            “HHS previously announced our plans to transform this department to Make America Healthy Again and we intend to do just that,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email to CNN after the Supreme Court's ruling last week.
    


            In a reorganization announced March 27, HHS eliminated 10,000 employees across agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health; some have since gotten their jobs back, but the number losing employment Monday is in the thousands, a spokesperson for the agency confirmed.
    


            Some of those 10,000, though, are protected at least temporarily under a different court case, New York v. Kennedy, and are not being separated immediately, the spokesperson said. That includes employees at six units of the CDC — the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; the National Center for Environmental Health; the Division of Reproductive Health; the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; the Office on Smoking and Health; and the National Center for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities — the Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA; the Office of Head Start; and the Division of Data and Technical Analysis under the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
    


            “All employees previously notified on April 1 have been separated, except for those” to whom the temporary protection in New York v. Kennedy applies, the HHS spokesperson said.
    


            In that case, Judge Melissa DuBose of US District Court in Rhode Island granted a preliminary injunction request this month from a coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia to halt the March 27 reorganization plan.
    


            Last week, the administration asked DuBose to narrow her ruling to the divisions cited by the HHS spokesperson, but the judge has yet to rule on that request.
    


HHS reinstates more than 450 CDC employees fired in April reorganization, including childhood lead poisoning team



            The layoffs will probably be challenged in court given that many HHS workers are still protected by DuBose's order, but the agency could argue that the Supreme Court ruling allows it to reduce staff, said Michael Fallings, a managing partner at Tully Rinckey who specializes in federal employment law.
    


            Also Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with mass layoffs at another agency – the Department of Education – for now. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a teachers union, school districts, states and education groups.
    


            Within two hours of that decision, the department sent notices to employees indicating that it's immediately resuming its plans and that the workers would be let go on August 1.
    


            “They seem to be emboldened by the recent Supreme Court decisions that have been green-lighting the Trump administration's actions that other courts have stayed,” said Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at the O'Neill Institute at Georgetown University, of HHS proceeding with the layoffs.
    


            In last week's Supreme Court ruling, the justices allowed federal agencies to proceed with their reduction-in-force, or RIF, plans, putting on hold a lower court order that had temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from taking those steps without approval from Congress.
    


            But the justices noted that “we express no view on the legality of any Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan,” leaving open the possibility that it could rule against a specific agency's layoff plan in the future if the reductions appeared to make it impossible for the department to carry out its obligation under the law.
    


            Filed by a coalition of more than a dozen unions, nonprofits and local governments, that case stemmed from an executive order Trump signed in mid-February that kicked off the process of significantly reducing the size of federal agencies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday as worries over U.S. inflation and a mixed bag of big bank earnings dragged the blue-chip index lower. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a boost from gains in Nvidia.

The 30-stock Dow lost 436.36 points, or 0.98%, and closed at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 lost 0.40% and closed at 6,243.76, easing from a fresh record high reached earlier in the session. The Nasdaq was an outperformer, adding 0.18% and posting a record close of 20,677.80. The tech-heavy index was aided by a 4% rise in Nvidia shares after the chip company said it hopes to "soon" resume deliveries of its H20 GPU sales to China. 

June inflation data released Tuesday represented an increase from May levels, despite the headline numbers matching expectations. The consumer price index increased 0.3% on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, matching a consensus poll from Dow Jones. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew 0.2% month over month, slightly less than expected. Year over year, it expanded by 2.9%, matching estimates.

The print spurred fears about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1.

"The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury.

"While there was a mild miss in the core number, both the main and underlying inflation measures are now printing at their highest levels in four months. The big fear for Fed officials is that stormier waters lie ahead, as not only is there a time lag between the tariffs and an increase to prices, but additional tariff hikes on 1st August would almost certainly herald further inflationary pressures ahead," Ryan added.

Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report coming in-line with expectations, but that "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming."

On the earnings front, reports from several financial heavyweights failed to impress investors.

Wells Fargo beat earnings, but a reduction in net interest income guidance sent shares lower by more than 5%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged lower even though the bank posted better-than-expected second-quarter results driven by strong trading and investment banking revenue. Asset manager BlackRock slipped nearly 6% on a quarterly revenue miss.

Citigroup bucked the negative trend in financials, rising more than 3% after the bank topped second-quarter estimates.

Wall Street is hoping that the second-quarter earnings season will boost a stock market that's already near all-time highs. Expectations are low ahead of the reports, however. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. That would be mark the lowest growth rate for the index going back to the fourth quarter of 2023.

The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% on Tuesday to close at 6,243.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 436.36 points, or 0.98%, ending at 44,023.29.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the only bright spot in Tuesday's market. The Nasdaq rose 0.18% to settle the session at 20,677.80.

Several crypto-related legislative measures failed to beat a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.

The vote came in at 196 to 223, with 13 Republican lawmakers siding with Democrats to block the procedural motion.

The vote comes after President Donald Trump encouraged Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of the measure. "The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets – Nobody does it better!" he wrote on Truth Social earlier Tuesday.

Crypto-linked stocks traded lower, with Circle Internet Group dropping 4% and Coinbase Global losing 1%. Bitcoin also slipped below the $117,000 threshold, dropping more than 2% on the day.

Shares of Southwest Airlines could be set to take a breather, according to Evercore ISI.

The firm downgraded Southwest Airlines stock to in line from outperform on Tuesday, alongside a $40 per share price target. Evercore's forecast implies roughly 6% upside from Monday's $37.70 close. The stock has gained about 11% so far in 2025.

"Southwest is in the process of implementing numerous logical changes which should help its lagging margins begin to recover by 4Q25. Trading at 36x '25E, 11x '26E EPS, we believe shares are now much closer to fair value and are beginning to more fully price in clean execution of these initiatives into next year," analyst Duane Pfennigwerth wrote.

A social media analysis shows consumers are lovin' McDonald's new menu item, according to Wolfe Research.

"We think excitement for Snack Wraps ... positively contributed to brand buzz/momentum to start 3Q," Greg Badishkanian, head of the firm's consumer team, wrote to clients in a Tuesday note. "But are waiting to see what happens after initial trial."

The fast food giant brought its chicken wrap back to menus last week after originally being discontinued in 2016. Badishkanian said social media checks and industry conversations imply the item is doing well so far.

Badishkanian also said the product should perform better than McCrispy strips, another new release, given what he called pent-up excitement and because of the fact that it was a prior fan favorite.

McDonald's shares ticked lower in Tuesday session, putting a four-day win streak at risk. Shares have risen more than 3.5% in 2025.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Tuesday that he would buy his own stock, which was down more than 5% on the heels of the asset manager's weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter.

"They think our expenses may be too high, and our expenses are all front loaded," Fink said on "Money Movers." "But I'm thrilled where we are. I'm thrilled about our position with our clients."

"Long term, I'm a huge buyer of BlackRock at these prices," he continued.

Fink also called the artificial intelligence infrastructure opportunity for BlackRock "enormous" and said that he believes infrastructure investing is "at the beginning of a golden age."

Jefferies is stepping to the sidelines on DoorDash following its recent outperformance.

Shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after analyst John Colantuoni downgraded shares of the food delivery company to hold from buy. His updated price target implies slight upside of about 3% from Monday's close.

This comes as the stock has jumped almost 42% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of more than 6%.

"Our profit decomposition supports upside to cons and peer-leading EBITDA growth, but likely not enough to justify continued outperformance without assigning optimistic multiples to DASH's non-core businesses," the analyst wrote. "We also think a recent ramp in affordability initiatives could limit upside to take rate."

"With the stock up 45% YTD and valuation at a 120% premium to Internet, we downgrade to Hold given DASH's strong execution and growth algorithm appear fully reflected," he continued.

While Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally remains optimistic that the Trump administration will come to a negotiated tariff deal that will be a positive for automakers, he is cautious on Tesla. "We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL," he wrote, citing several factors for his concern.

McNally said "long-term negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated," with fiscal 2026 earnings per share on pace to be about 85% lower than 2022 predictions. He's also worried about a disappointing autonomous vehicle rollout, "divisive political posting," and technical moves in the stock that are on the edge of turning negative. Tesla stock has fallen more than 21% year to date, but was slightly positive in Tuesday's session.

In the near term, McNally said he is expecting second-quarter profits in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents per share, which is below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 44 cents.

The S&P 500 has posted 55 days above its 20-day moving average, the longest such streak going back to January 2021 when it was 56 days, according to BTIG. The 20-day moving average, which indicates short-term trends, is at around 6,144. 

The long streak is a bullish long-term signal for the stock market, suggesting the S&P 500 can continue to climb higher now that it's back to trading around all-time highs. But, over the near term, it suggests the broad market is due for a pullback.  

"We are clearly stretching the limits of time without a 20 DMA break, and former such streaks often led to periods of volatility or consolidation," BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky wrote Monday. 

"We think at a minimum we see a test of ~6144 as we head into the back-half of July as volatility enters a a seasonally strong period, and likely something closer to the 6k level heading into August," he added.

Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials jumped more than 25% Tuesday on a $500 million deal to supply Apple with magnets that are manufactured at a plant in Texas.

MP will provide Apple with rare earth magnets made from recycled materials at its Independence plant in Forth Worth. The input materials come from end-of-life magnets, the miner said.

The deal comes after MP announced last week that the Pentagon was purchasing a direct equity stake, sending the miner's shares skyrocketing about 50%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, following an inflation report that showed prices rising but mostly in line with market expectations.

"Consumer Prices LOW. Bring down the Fed Rate, NOW!!!" Trump posted on his Truth Social site.

In a separate post, Trump called for a 3 percentage point reduction.

"Fed should cut Rates by 3 Points. Very Low Inflation. One Trillion Dollars a year would be saved!!!" he said.

The statements followed a report showing the consumer price index in June rose 0.3%, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation also moved higher, rising 0.2%, with a 2.9% annual rate.

Companies have a low bar to clear this earnings season. 

The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% in the second quarter, on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. That would be the lowest for the index going back to the fourth quarter of 2023, when it was just 4.0%.

Advertising tech company The Trade Desk will become part of the S&P 500, effective before trading opens on Friday, July 18, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Joining the broad market index tends to lift a company's share price: The Trade Desk jumped 14% in extended trading following the announcement.

Just last week, Wall Street firm Stephens predicted that The Trade Desk could be a potential contender to join the S&P 500's communications services sector, which is an underweight grouping in the index.

The Trade Desk will replace software company Ansys, which is on track to be acquired by Synopsys on or about Thursday.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin fell below the $117,000 level on Tuesday after cryptocurrency-related bills were blocked in the House of Representatives.

The price of bitcoin was last down 2.8% at $116,516.00, according to Coin Metrics. That marks a pullback from the day's high of $120,481.86.

The drop comes on the heels of multiple crypto-related bills failing to overcome a procedural hurdle in the House, with 13 Republicans voting with Democrats to block the motion in a 196-223 vote.

In recent days, bitcoin has been trading at all-time highs, spurred by institutional buying of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid rising optimism that Congress would soon pass crypto legislation.

Stocks linked to crypto also came under pressure in late afternoon trading. Shares of bitcoin miners Riot Platforms and Mara Holdings closed down 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Others like crypto trading platforms Coinbase slid 1.5%. All were under pressure in extended trading.

Several cryptocurrency regulation bills backed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives, dealing a major blow to the crypto industry.

The final vote on the rule was 196-223, with 13 Republicans voting with Democrats to block the procedural motion. The measure cannot move forward until the House approves the rule, which governs debate for legislation.

The vote, during what is being billed as "Crypto Week," was a rare instance of House Republicans refusing to take direction from Trump. The measures had been widely expected to pass.

House leadership tentatively plans to hold another vote later Tuesday to try to advance the legislation.

It was unclear whether the second vote would be for an identical rule and the same bills, or whether House Republican leaders would make changes to the package to satisfy GOP caucus members who opposed the motion.

Crypto-linked stocks turned lower after the vote failed.

Shares of the stablecoin company Circle dropped more than 7% on the news, while Coinbase fell more than 4%. Shares of the digital asset firm MARA Holdings dipped more than 2%.

One of the three bills in limbo after the failed vote is the GENIUS Act, which passed the Senate last month with some Democratic support. The GENIUS Act seeks to regulate stablecoins.

Another bill, the CLARITY Act, would establish rules for whether an asset is regulated as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission or as a commodity overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The third proposal would prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of the Republicans who opposed the measure, wrote in a post on, "I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments to the GENIUS Act."

"President Trump included a ban on CBDC in his January 23rd executive order and Congress must also include the ban on CBDC in the GENIUS Act," Greene wrote.

Trump had hailed "Crypto Week" during a post on his Truth Social earlier Tuesday and urged all House Republicans to vote "yes" on the measure.

"The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets - Nobody does it better!" Trump wrote.

"The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it," he wrote.

"Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!)," Trump continued.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday said the Trump administration reversed course on allowing Nvidia to sell its AI chips to China because the U.S. company will not be giving over its best technology.

Lutnick made the remark speaking with CNBC's Brian Sullivan, saying that Nvidia wants to sell China its "fourth best" chip, which is slower than the fastest chips that U.S. companies use.

"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best," Lutnick said.

Nvidia said Monday night that it would soon resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration signaled that it would grant the chipmaker necessary export licenses.

Lutnick said that the administration said that the renewed sale of H20 chips to China was linked to a rare earths magnet deal. He said it was in U.S. interests to have Chinese companies using American technology so they continue to use an American "tech stack."

"The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it," Lutnick said. "We want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology stack, because they still rely upon it."

Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said in recent weeks that the U.S. should continue selling his chips to China so Chinese companies don't invest in homegrown infrastructure. Huang on Sunday also said that the Chinese military wouldn't use Nvidia chips anyway, and previously signaled that China's Huawei is a legitimate competitor.

"The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own," Lutnick said. "You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips."

The reversal is a major win for Nvidia. Huang had previously said the Trump administration's decision to require a license for the H20 chip in April "effectively closed" the China market. Nvidia said it could have sold $8 billion in H20 chips in the current quarter before sales were stopped.

The administration reversed its decision after President Donald Trump met with Huang in Washington last week.

"You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack," Lutnick said. "That's the thinking."

The H20 chip was introduced in 2022 in response to Biden administration export controls. It's based on the same underlying technology as Nvidia's Hopper-generation chips, which are sold in the U.S. as finished systems using H100 or H200 chips.

The U.S. chipmaker took some features out of the H20 in order to sell it to China, including fewer graphics processing unit cores and lower bandwidth connecting separate parts of the chip. But the success of the DeepSeek R1 model suggested that there were many Chinese companies that were just fine with the slowed-down chips. The China-specific H20 is behind Nvidia's Blackwell chips, the H100 and the H200, Lutnick said.

Nvidia says that it releases new artificial intelligence chips every year and that serious AI developers should always try to get the latest and greatest versions because the technology is improving so quickly.

The best AI chips broadly available from clouds and system makers today are called Blackwell, and come as a GB200 chip with a paired central processing unit as well as B100 and B200 versions. Nvidia also makes a range of Blackwell-based chips for gaming and graphics that can be used for AI, but they're generally weaker than the biggest chips designed for data centers.

A successor, called Blackwell Ultra, is only now starting to be installed in data centers, and it's expected to ramp in volume over the next year. In 2027, Nvidia will release "Vera Rubin" chips.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday as worries over U.S. inflation and a mixed bag of big bank earnings dragged the blue-chip index lower. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a boost from gains in Nvidia.

The 30-stock Dow lost 313 points, or 0.5%. The The Nasdaq jumped 0.5%, lifted by a more than 4% rise in Nvidia shares after the chip company said it hopes to "soon" resume deliveries of its H20 GPU sales to China. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, easing from a fresh record high it reached earlier in the session.

June inflation data released Tuesday represented an increase from May levels, despite the headline numbers matching expectations. The consumer price index increased 0.3% on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, matching a consensus poll from Dow Jones. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew 0.2% month over month, slightly less than expected. Year over year, it expanded by 2.9%, matching estimates.

The print spurred fears about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1.

"The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy.

"While there was a mild miss in the core number, both the main and underlying inflation measures are now printing at their highest levels in four months. The big fear for Fed officials is that stormier waters lie ahead, as not only is there a time lag between the tariffs and an increase to prices, but additional tariff hikes on 1st August would almost certainly herald further inflationary pressures ahead," Ryan added.

Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report coming in-line with expectations, but that "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming."

On the earnings front, reports from several financial heavyweights failed to impress investors.

Wells Fargo beat earnings, but a reduction in net interest income guidance sent shares lower by more than 4%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged lower even though the bank posted better-than-expected second-quarter results driven by strong trading and investment banking revenue. Asset manager BlackRock slipped more than 6% on a quarterly revenue miss.

Citigroup bucked the negative trend in financials, rising about 1% after the bank topped second-quarter estimates.

Wall Street is hoping that the second-quarter earnings season will boost a stock market that's already near all-time highs. Expectations are low ahead of the reports, however. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. That would be mark the lowest growth rate for the index going back to the fourth quarter of 2023.

While Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally remains optimistic that the Trump administration will come to a negotiated tariff deal that will be a positive for automakers, he is cautious on Tesla. "We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL," he wrote, citing several factors for his concern.

McNally said "long-term negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated," with fiscal 2026 earnings per share on pace to be about 85% lower than 2022 predictions. He's also worried about a disappointing autonomous vehicle rollout, "divisive political posting," and technical moves in the stock that are on the edge of turning negative. Tesla stock has fallen more than 21% year to date, but was slightly positive in Tuesday's session.

In the near term, McNally said he is expecting second-quarter profits in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents per share, which is below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 44 cents.

The S&P 500 has posted 55 days above its 20-day moving average, the longest such streak going back to January 2021 when it was 56 days, according to BTIG. The 20-day moving average, which indicates short-term trends, is at around 6,144. 

The long streak is a bullish long-term signal for the stock market, suggesting the S&P 500 can continue to climb higher now that it's back to trading around all-time highs. But, over the near term, it suggests the broad market is due for a pullback.  

"We are clearly stretching the limits of time without a 20 DMA break, and former such streaks often led to periods of volatility or consolidation," BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky wrote Monday. 

"We think at a minimum we see a test of ~6144 as we head into the back-half of July as volatility enters a a seasonally strong period, and likely something closer to the 6k level heading into August," he added.

Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials jumped more than 25% Tuesday on a $500 million deal to supply Apple with magnets that are manufactured at a plant in Texas.

MP will provide Apple with rare earth magnets made from recycled materials at its Independence plant in Forth Worth. The input materials come from end-of-life magnets, the miner said.

The deal comes after MP announced last week that the Pentagon was purchasing a direct equity stake, sending the miner's shares skyrocketing about 50%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, following an inflation report that showed prices rising but mostly in line with market expectations.

"Consumer Prices LOW. Bring down the Fed Rate, NOW!!!" Trump posted on his Truth Social site.

In a separate post, Trump called for a 3 percentage point reduction.

"Fed should cut Rates by 3 Points. Very Low Inflation. One Trillion Dollars a year would be saved!!!" he said.

The statements followed a report showing the consumer price index in June rose 0.3%, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation also moved higher, rising 0.2%, with a 2.9% annual rate.

The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing index jumped to 5.5, a nearly 22-point improvement over the prior month and much better than the -9.5 forecast from Dow Jones. The gauge measures the percentage difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction.

Within the index, new orders surged 16.2 points to positive level, while shipments soared 18.7 points to 11.5 and inventories climbed 14.7 points to 15.6. The prices paid index accelerated but the prices received index nudged lower while the employment index also improved, rising to 9.2, up 4.5 points from June.

Looking to the future, the general business conditions outlook for six months down the road improved to 24.1, or a 2.9-point gain.

Companies have a low bar to clear this earnings season. 

The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% in the second quarter, on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. That would be the lowest for the index going back to the fourth quarter of 2023, when it was just 4.0%. 

— Sarah Min

Advertising tech company The Trade Desk will become part of the S&P 500, effective before trading opens on Friday, July 18, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Joining the broad market index tends to lift a company's share price: The Trade Desk jumped 14% in extended trading following the announcement.

Just last week, Wall Street firm Stephens predicted that The Trade Desk could be a potential contender to join the S&P 500's communications services sector, which is an underweight grouping in the index.

The Trade Desk will replace software company Ansys, which is on track to be acquired by Synopsys on or about Thursday.

If there is one thing the U.S. needs to lead the artificial intelligence revolution, it's electricity. Insane amounts of it.

A 2024 report commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy found that data centers — the backbone of artificial intelligence — already accounted for more than 4% of U.S. electricity use, and the report said that could grow to 12% by 2028. That would be 580 billion kilowatt hours, or nearly 20 times the annual power consumption of the city of Chicago.

"Data centers run 24/7, and need to be able to support the needs of our users," said Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers for Meta. The parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp has announced a massive push into AI.

"We use a lot of power. We need to make sure we have a robust grid," she said.

Meta is not alone, say economic development experts.

"The big issues right now are deliverability of sites," said Tom Stringer, a principal and leader of the site selection and incentives practice at Grassi Advisors in New York. "And maybe the biggest component of that is adequate power."

The deals keep coming. On Tuesday, Google announced it would spend $25 billion to develop data centers along the nation's largest multi-state grid, an electricity region covering 13 states in all. Meanwhile. CoreWeave announced a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania.

CNBC considers each state's electrical grid in our annual competitiveness study, America's Top States for Business. Under the study's methodology, we use U.S. Department of Energy data on grid reliability — the duration of power outages per year — as well as the retail price of electricity.

With a wealth of inexpensive, reliable electricity, these states are the best equipped to power the AI revolution, and everything else.

The power grid in Washington — and across the Pacific Northwest — faces no shortage of challenges. While demand grows, climate change is intensifying the storms that batter the area every year and threatening the consistency of hydroelectric power, an important source for the region. But so far, the state is meeting the demand at a reasonable price.

Largest electric utility: Puget Sound Energy

Power outages statewide: 2.53 hours/year (2023)

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $10.16/kWh (2024)

Power from renewable sources: 10.2%

New Mexico is the seventh largest generator of wind energy, according to the Energy Department, and it is seeking to increase the use of other alternative sources like solar power to meet relentless demand. The state is also seeking to modernize its grid with tools like smart meters that will help the state better coordinate supply and demand.

Largest electric utility: Public Service Company of New Mexico

Power outages statewide: 2.82 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.30/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 59.6%

Montana is home to the Western end of the North Plains Connector, a 420-mile, 525-kilovolt-transmission line that will connect the Eastern and Western U.S. electrical grids for the first time. The $3.2 billion project, funded in part by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, aims to make the grid more resilient and responsive to demand, with the ability to move electricity in either direction between Montana and North Dakota. The project is in the permitting phase, with construction expected to begin in 2028, and electricity expected to begin flowing in 2032.

Largest electric utility: NorthWestern Energy

Power outages statewide: 1.98 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $10.84/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 25.1%

North Dakotans enjoy the cheapest electricity of any state — roughly 30% cheaper than in neighboring Minnesota. One reason, the U.S. Department of Energy says, is that the state has abundant supplies of coal and natural gas, and a small population. That allows the state to produce far more energy than it consumes. But the state also boasts the most abundant wind energy resources in the nation, and it is rich in other renewable sources like biomass. In all, North Dakota generates about one-third of its power from renewable sources, and efforts are underway to increase that. EmPower North Dakota, an agency created by the state legislature in 2007, aims to diversify the state's grid beyond fossil fuels.

Largest electric utility: Xcel Energy

Power outages statewide: 3.48 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $8.00/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 34.7%

Idaho was early to the data center sweepstakes, landing Meta's massive Kuna data center back in 2022. The roughly 1-million-square-foot facility is expected to begin operations next year. To fulfill Meta's promise that the center will run on 100% renewable energy, the company is helping to develop a 200-megawatt solar facility nearby. But Idaho is also rich in other renewable sources, most notably hydroelectric power. Idaho is also one of the only states capable of generating significant amounts of electricity through geothermal power.

Largest electric utility: Idaho Power (IDACORP)

Power outages statewide: 2.29 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.52/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 29%

South Dakota is meeting the voracious demand for energy with a heavy reliance on renewables — especially wind, which accounts for 55% of the state's electricity generation, according to the Energy Department. The only state more reliant on wind is Iowa. The Energy Department notes that wind power surpassed hydropower in South Dakota for the first time in 2021. By 2023, wind energy had surged to three times as much electricity generation as hydropower. All the while, South Dakota has maintained one of the most reliable grids in the nation.

Largest electric utility: Xcel Energy

Power outages statewide: 1.28 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $11/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 62.5%

While coal still accounts for nearly half of Utah's electricity generation, that is down sharply from 75% a decade ago, according to the Energy Department. The Utah Office of Energy Development says its Strategic Energy Plan differs from energy policies in many other states because it prioritizes the human consequences of its actions.

"While other states enact energy policies focused on energy resources and emissions, Utah is focused on ensuring our citizens maintain their standard of living and have the chance to thrive," the office's website says.

The policy aims to double the state's power production by 2025, while keeping costs affordable, increasing efficiency, and protecting the environment.

Largest electric utility: Rocky Mountain Power – a division of Berkshire Hathaway's PacifiCorp

Power outages statewide: 2.12 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.03/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 32%

Wyoming is coal country — home to about one-third of the nation's recoverable coal reserves, according to the Energy Department. So, it should come as no surprise that coal-fired power plants produce around three-quarters of Wyoming's electricity, more than any state except West Virginia. But that is down from 97% in 2003. Since then, coal's decline as a preferred energy source nationwide has profoundly affected Wyoming's economy. Still, with the smallest population of any state, and all that coal — plus abundant wind, hydroelectric, natural gas and solar power — Wyoming produces far more power than it consumes. That makes for very low costs on a reliable grid.

Largest electric utility: Rocky Mountain Power – a division of Berkshire Hathaway's PacifiCorp

Power outages statewide: 1.99 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.15/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 24.8%

No state gets more of its electricity from wind than Iowa, according to the Energy Department, which says Iowa's power mix has changed rapidly over the past decade or so. Coal, which was dominant until around 2019, now accounts for less than a quarter of the state's electricity production. The state's only nuclear plant, the Duane Arnold Energy Center near Cedar Rapids, ceased operations after sustaining damage in the infamous 2020 derecho. Now, the plant's owner, NextEra Energy Resources, is looking into the possibility of restarting the plant to help meet demand from projects like data centers. But the company is also developing two new solar farms on the site.

Largest electric utility: MidAmerican Energy (Berkshire Hathaway)

Power outages statewide: 1.75 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.43/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 65.6%

Nebraska offers America's most reliable power grid, at among the lowest cost. The Energy Department says Nebraska is the only state in which all electricity providers are owned by the public — either through public power districts, municipal power systems, or rural electric cooperatives. Most of the state's electricity still comes from coal-fired power plants, but the amount of electricity generated by coal is the lowest in a generation.

In May, Gov. Jim Pillen signed legislation placing new restrictions on cryptocurrency mining — another major user of electricity. The law requires miners to contribute to grid improvements, and it allows utilities to require them to shut down during times of peak demand.

Largest electric utility: Nebraska Public Power District

Power outages statewide: 1.21 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.19/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 33.6%

Gold:

Barrick Mining Corp. is in advanced talks to sell its last Canadian gold mine to Discovery Silver Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, as the firms seek to capitalize on the soaring price of the precious metal. 

Discovery Silver is in the final stages of a process Barrick launched in April to sell the Hemlo gold mine in Ontario, the people said, who asked not to be named. There's no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he reached a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that will set a 19% tariff on the southeast Asian country's U.S. exports.

"We will pay no tariffs. So they are giving us access into Indonesia, which we never had," Trump told reporters outside the White House.

"That's probably the biggest part of the deal. And the other part is they are going to pay 19%," he said.

It was not immediately clear if Jakarta had approved the deal terms as described by Trump. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In a subsequent post on Truth Social, Trump said Indonesia "has committed to purchasing $15 Billion Dollars in U.S. Energy, $4.5 Billion Dollars in American Agricultural Products, and 50 Boeing Jets, many of them 777's" as part of the deal.

Indonesian airline Garuda was recently in talks to buy between 50 and 75 Boeing  aircraft, its CEO reportedly said in early July.

If it comes to pass, the new tariff rate on Indonesian imports would show Trump pulling back on the 32% duty he had threatened to impose as recently as last week.

Trump said in a brief social media post Tuesday morning that the agreement followed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

"I spoke to their really great president, very popular, very strong, smart, and we made the deal," Trump said at the White House later in the day.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CNBC's "Halftime Report" on Tuesday afternoon that Indonesia would drop its tariffs on U.S. goods as part of the agreement.

"No tariffs there. They pay tariffs here," Lutnick said.

The White House did not respond to CNBC's requests for additional information about the purported deal with Indonesia.

Indonesia is one of the United States' top 25 trade partners, with the two countries trading more than $38 billion in goods in 2024, according to the Commerce Department. The U.S. trade deficit with Indonesia totaled $17.9 billion last year.

Trump's post on Indonesia closely resembles his July 2 announcement that the U.S. reached a trade deal with Vietnam.

Trump's initial message about Vietnam was also short on details, though he declared in a follow-up post that the terms included a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports.

Vietnamese officials were reportedly surprised about Trump's description of their preliminary deal with the U.S. As of July 10, the Vietnamese government still has not formally accepted part of the deal Trump touted, Politico reported.

The U.S. has also made a preliminary trade deal with the United Kingdom, and it has reached another agreement with China that allowed both sides to lower the sky-high tariffs on each others' goods.

But Trump has recently eschewed the traditional trade negotiation process, opting instead to send letters to U.S. trade partners that dictate what their new U.S. tariff rate will be starting on Aug. 1.

As private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin develop reusable rockets and push aspirations for lunar and Martian colonization, real estate investors are dialing in. Some liken it to the early days of the railroads, when entire towns grew up around new lines. One of the biggest plays is lunar and deep space data centers.

Hines, a global real estate investment, development and management firm, recently announced the acquisition of the Titusville Logistics Center, a nearly 250,000-square-foot, Class A industrial property located in Florida's Space Coast submarket. The property is fully leased to aerospace tenants. This is just one example of investors looking to capitalize on the boom in the space exploration sector's real estate needs.

"A real revolution has happened in the industry, and as things start to get unlocked, companies are looking for how they can monetize space more broadly, and there's a lot of pieces to that," said David Steinbach, global chief investment officer at Hines. 

Steinbach points to both infrastructure support here on Earth, as well as real estate development for manufacturing on the moon. It may sound futuristic, but it's already underway.

"We are in the early days of something that will be some major investments, and we're creating these new rails of the future. In this case, it's more into orbit instead of on the ground, but when you think about it that way, think about all the nodes that are going to get developed and created. It's exciting, and I think investors need to be thinking that way," he said.

One of those rails is data centers. They are going up at a quick pace all over the world, and at the same time sucking up more energy than most local grids can handle. Putting them in space offers a fully decarbonized energy solution. 

"There is unlimited power in space because of the sun, there is unlimited cooling with the vacuum of space, and there's unlimited real estate in terms of where you can put these things," said Steinbach.

The data centers could be built on the moon and either kept there or launched into space. The data would simply be beamed back to Earth.

Several companies are already working on construction methods for the moon, including 3D printing. ICON, a Texas-based construction technology company, is collaborating with NASA on developing 3D printing technology for construction on the moon and Mars. NASA is providing support through its Small Business Innovation Research program. 

And a California startup called Ethos says it has the technology for a moon-based cement ready to go, making it out of the moon's primary material, anorthosite.

"Ethos takes the geological resources on the moon, and it turns them into buildable props," said Ross Centers, the company's CEO. "It's a whole new world waiting to be developed, and we develop it. We turn it into landing pads, roads, foundations for data centers and other great things."

Centers said Ethos can also use anorthosite to make raw materials for solar panels, conductors and other materials needed to build data centers and other industrial facilities. And he pointed to the massive proliferation of rocket launches that will only multiply. He calls that his ride.

"People are really excited about this vision. This is something that people have been looking for. It's not every generation that you get a whole new continent to unlock," said Centers. 

Industrial warehouses here on Earth will still serve the space economy, Centers said, providing capacity for all the things that will be transported into space as well as areas for space-driven manufacturing. 

But the warehouse sector overall is getting softer now, with vacancy rates at 8.5% in May nationally due to tariff uncertainty, according to Yardi Research. That's up 290 points in the prior 12 months. Just 86.9 million square feet of new warehouse space was started as of May, on pace for the lowest annual total since 2018.

Steinbach admits that industrial broadly is seeing some headwinds in the U.S., and some submarkets – particularly the distribution centers for big box stores – are feeling that more than others. But he also said there are certain markets that are very undersupplied, and the space-support sector is one of them. That's in both Florida and Texas.

Steinbach argued there needs to be more development, more capital going toward construction of the infrastructure necessary to support this space real estate race. But, as with everything else, higher interest rates are holding it back. If rates come down, he said, the capital will come. 

"I think the capital is looking for great opportunities. They're looking for great returns, and this is one of them," Steinbach said.

Apple and miner MP Materials announced a $500 million deal Tuesday for rare earth magnets and the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker's U.S. supply chain.

MP Materials stock climbed 24%. Shares of Apple were marginally higher.

As part of the agreement, Apple will buy rare earth magnets created at the company's facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Both companies will combine on a new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. MP Materials plans to start shipping magnets in 2027.

"American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we're proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. "Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.".

Apple said the deal will create dozens of new manufacturing and research and development roles.

Rare earth magnets are key components that make up everything from consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers to cars and renewable energy systems.

For years, the U.S. has worked on curbing its reliance on China, which dominates the global rare earth elements supply chain. MP Materials operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S.

Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner, buying $400 million in preferred stock to improve rare earth magnet supply on American soil.

Apple announced a plan to invest more than $500 billion to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities earlier this year. The plan included a new factory for artificial intelligence servers in Texas.

Shares of MP Materials have nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, pushing the miner's market capitalization to nearly $10 billion. The stock has nearly doubled over the last month.

Wells Fargo beat second-quarter profit estimates on Tuesday but cut its 2025 guidance for net interest income, sending the shares of the lender down 2% in trading before the bell.

The bank expects its interest income to be roughly in line with the 2024 level of $47.7 billion. In April, it said NII growth would be at the low end of the 1% to 3% range.

Wells Fargo said lower interest income in its markets business led to the NII forecast cut. Analysts and investors were skeptical about its ability to meet its interest income targets after a slow start to 2025.

"While there continue to be risks..., activity levels have remained consistent and our strong credit performance continues to point to the strength of our commercial and consumer customers' financial position," CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement.

The bank had expected its NII, or the difference between what it earns on loans and pays out on deposits, to be relatively stable in the first half of 2025, with more growth in the second half.

Heading into the results, some analysts expected the bank to cut its NII forecast as elevated interest rates weighed on demand from borrowers.

"A modest reduction in NII guide was attributed to the markets business, which it said would be largely offset by higher non-interest income, so we expect overall revenues for 2025 to remain near the current consensus," said Stephen Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research.

Meanwhile, provision for credit losses fell to $1.01 billion in the quarter from $1.24 billion a year ago, helping profit to grow in the second quarter.

The fourth-largest U.S. lender's net income was $5.49 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the three months ended June 30, it said on Tuesday. That compares with $4.91 billion, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time costs, the lender earned $1.54 per share compared with expectations of $1.41, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.

Investment banking fees rose 9% to $696 million in the quarter, driven by higher advisory fees.

Last month, the U.S. Federal Reserve lifted Wells Fargo's seven-year-long $1.95 trillion asset cap, allowing the bank to pursue unimpeded growth.

Wells Fargo has been focused on fixing its regulatory problems in recent years. While it labored under a $1.95 trillion cap asset cap, rivals expanded.

With the asset cap lifted and regulatory issues largely in the rearview mirror, Wall Street analysts expect Wells Fargo to attract more investor interest as its profits grow.

"We now have the opportunity to grow in ways we could not while the asset cap was in place and are able to move forward more aggressively," Scharf said.

Wells Fargo is likely to beef up its wholesale businesses by adding market share in commercial banking, corporate and investment banking and trading.

Scharf has said the bank will expand carefully. It has closed seven regulatory punishments, known as consent orders, this year and 13 since 2019. It still has one remaining consent order from 2018.

"The asset cap removal is expected to take some time for benefits to ramp up and be effective at more aggressively growing NII," Argus Research's Biggar said.

Wells Fargo had 212,804 employees as of June 30, compared with 215,367 at the end of March. Its headcount has fallen every quarter since late 2020.

Former President Barack Obama ripped Big Law firms for caving to the Trump administration just to protect their careers and fund their lavish lifestyles.

Obama was speaking at a private fundraiser in New Jersey on Friday when he expressed disappointment at how some of the country's top law firms had "set aside the law" in the face of President Donald Trump's attacks.

Obama said some lawyers were giving way to Trump not because they were "going to be thrown in jail, but because they might lose a few clients and might not be able to finish that kitchen rehab at their Hampton house."

"I'm not impressed," Obama said, per remarks obtained by MSNBC.

Obama's ties to Big Law go back to his Harvard Law School days. After his first year of law school, the former president worked as a summer associate at Sidley & Austin. 

Before entering politics, Obama worked as a civil rights attorney at the litigation firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland.

Since February, Trump has issued executive orders targeting Big Law firms like Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling. In his orders, Trump accused the firms of weaponizing the judicial system and stripped them of their security clearances. He also ordered reviews of each firm's contracts with the government.

Some law firms, such as Paul Weiss and Kirkland & Ellis, struck deals with Trump and promised to do pro bono legal work for conservative causes. Others, like Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, chose to fight back and filed lawsuits against the Trump administration.

In his remarks, Obama took aim at universities that chose to find room for compromise with Trump.

Obama's alma mater, Columbia University, gave in to the administration's demands after it slashed $400 million in federal funding. The Trump administration said the cuts were because of the university's failure to combat anti-semitism when protests over Israel's war in Gaza erupted on campus.

"If your core mission, if your core value is to teach, you may teach without compromising values of academic independence. Yeah, you may lose some grant money temporarily. That's why you have those big endowments," Obama said on Friday.

Obama has continued to be a vocal critic of Trump and his administration.

Last month, Obama told attendees at The Connecticut Forum on June 17 that the US was on the verge of becoming an autocracy under Trump.

"We're not there yet completely, but I think that we are dangerously close to normalizing behavior like that," Obama said.

Representatives for Obama did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Russia is staring down a long-term economic threat that could outlast both the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions: a deepening demographic crisis.

On Tuesday, Labor Minister Anton Kotyakov underscored the scale of the problem during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.

"Today, according to our estimates, by 2030 we need to involve 10.9 million people in the economy," Kotyakov told Putin, according to a post from the Kremlin.

Kotyakov said the number is required to replace 10.1 million people who will reach retirement age, and 800,000 new jobs.

Kotyakov warned that if productivity growth falls short of the assumptions built into the current forecast, there could be "an additional shortage of personnel."

The remarks came during a Kremlin meeting focused on demographics and healthcare. Members of Putin's cabinet discussed efforts to boost birth rates, including financial incentives like cash payouts and tax breaks for large families.

Putin has made population growth a national priority, calling it a matter of "ethnic survival" and encouraging women to have as many as eight children.

In 2024, births in Russia fell to 1.22 million — the lowest level since 1999 — while deaths increased by 3.3% to 1.82 million, according to official data. The country's population was about 146 million last year.

But boosting birth rates isn't Russia's only challenge. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated labor shortages, with battlefield injuries and deaths cutting into the working-age population and a brain drain pulling younger, educated professionals out of the country.

The demographic outlook is so bleak that the country's population could halve by the end of this century, per a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, in August.

Businesses are already feeling the heat. Employers are increasingly turning to retirees and even teenagers to fill roles.

The labor shortage has driven up wages and fueled inflation, adding strain to an economy already distorted by wartime spending.

By the end of 2023, Russia's economy was running so hot that the central bank warned of overheating.

The momentum may be fading.

Just last month, Russia's economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, warned that the country was "on the brink" of a recession.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) railed against House leadership Tuesday for allegedly blocking efforts to amend the GENIUS Act, a crypto-friendly bill that would establish a regulatory framework for digital currencies.

Taken up for a procedural vote in the House on Tuesday, the GENIUS Act failed to advance in a vote of 196-222, with critics like Greene accosting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for apparently not accepting amendments to the bill. Her largest grievance, Greene said, was the omission of a ban on the federal government developing a Central Bank Digital Currency, something President Donald Trump banned in January via executive order.

“The Senate left that out, and they sent this over to the House and Speaker Johnson didn't allow us to do amendments, to amend the bill to ban CBDC,” Greene told members of the press Tuesday. 

“That's a House issue. I fully support the president, I will vote for the GENIUS Act when they ban the Central Bank Digital Currency. We need to get it right, it shouldn't be run through.”

Greene and other Trump allies have long opposed the establishment of a central bank digital currency out of fear of government overreach, with opposition to the federal government dipping its toes in cryptocurrency becoming a rallying cry for the MAGA faithful.

While she went on to pledge support for the bill when it eventually returns for a vote, Greene urged House leadership to allow a ban on establishing such a currency to move forward, and warned of the potential repercussions should her and her allies' efforts be stonewalled.

“Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency,” Greene wrote Tuesday in a social media post on X.

“Republicans have a duty to ban CBDC. President Trump included a ban on CBDC in his January 23rd executive order and Congress must also include the ban on CBDC in the GENIUS Act.”

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Altcoins have recently shown a significant surge, marking a potential new beginning for the cryptocurrency market. This resurgence is particularly notable as Ethereum has surged past the $3,000 mark, breaking out of a six-year consolidation phase. This breakout is reminiscent of the February-March 2024 period when Ethereum experienced a significant gain following a similar surge. The total crypto market cap has jumped, as investors rotate into altcoins, especially those with strong staking mechanics like Ethereum. This shift in capital from Bitcoin to altcoins indicates that the market may be entering an altcoin season, where altcoins outperform Bitcoin.

The Ethereum supply locked has hit a new all-time high, further signaling a strong resurgence in momentum. This is supported by a rare bullish crossover on Ethereum's moving averages, typically seen during major rallies, potentially signaling the end of the crypto winter. The market is in the early stages of altcoin season, with key indicators flashing breakout signals and market momentum rising. This is evident in the performance of veteran altcoins, which have shown impressive gains. Stellar (XLM), ranked 12th by market cap, has a weekly gain of 82%, leading among similar assets. ADA, ranked 10th by market cap, has a weekly gain of nearly 30%; Ripple (XRP) 29%; Dogecoin (DOGE) 18%. Some newer altcoins, such as the L1 project Sei (SEI) and the synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA), have also shown impressive gains, with weekly increases exceeding 30%.

The collective strength of veteran altcoins is interpreted as an early signal of retail funds possibly flowing back. These tokens represent cryptocurrencies that have existed for a longer time and have larger market capitalizations, and their activity often reflects retail market participation and funding preferences. The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), is entering the "Banana Zone 2.0," which typically indicates that after a period of consolidation, the market will enter a phase of explosive breakout. This suggests that the altcoin market may no longer be merely speculative frenzy but rather driven by fundamentals and institutional funding for more sustainable growth.

The altcoin season index stands at 32/100, still far from the 75-point threshold, indicating that the market remains in a Bitcoin-dominated phase. However, the index has recently shown a positive upward trend, suggesting that early signs of rotation are emerging. Key signals for the arrival of altcoin season include strengthening dominance of altcoins, rapid price increases, and FOMO sentiment and retail frenzy. The decline in Bitcoin dominance is an important feature of the current market, with altcoins beginning to perform widely, indicating that institutional and retail investors may be diversifying their funds into alternative digital assets.

The launch of spot ETFs, advances in Layer 2 (L2) solutions, the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, the development of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and the improvement of blockchain gaming infrastructure have all brought new value narratives and application prospects to altcoins, providing fundamental support. Therefore, while it remains to be seen how long the "mini altcoin season" can last, the positive signals released by the market indicate that investors are re-embracing risk, injecting much-needed vitality into the market.

Bitcoin's price has seen a decline of nearly 3%, while Ethereum experienced a 2.5% increase. This follows Bitcoin's rapid pullback from its all-time high of over $123,000. The drop is attributed to several factors, including a $10 billion whale sale, newly announced tariffs, inflation data, and geopolitical threats. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's resilience offers motivation for altcoin enthusiasts. An analyst and investor known as Evanss6 suggests that the time for change might have arrived. The primary reason being the recent, genuine reversal signal in the ETHBTC pair, an occurrence not seen for a prolonged period. “ETH continues to trade below the levels seen when ETFs were released, which seems incorrect. For the first time in over a year, ETHBTC has risen above the 200-day moving average. Several significant changes have occurred since then. For example, Grayscale's surplus supply has been eliminated. Ethereum has secured Saylor through Sharplink/Lubin. The Ethereum Foundation has undergone significant changes. The Trump administration canceled OCP2.0.”

If ETH begins to strengthen, this signals a potential rise for altcoins as well. The reversal in the ETHBTC pair is crucial, yet it must be sustained. The transition from over 1,000 days of negativity impacts all altcoins. As seen in previous altcoin bull runs, ETH's lead is vital as it paves the way for others, with altcoins potentially shadowing ETH as it approaches its all-time high. Negotiations regarding tariffs will continue until August 1, with the Fed's interest rate decision expected at the end of the month. Currently, negative factors like tariff letters are not hindering Ether's progress. Given that major developments are clustered towards the end of the month, ETH has a chance to approach $3,500. Hence, altcoins might experience notable increases over the next two weeks. The markets are set to be active again in August, and unless tariffs are further delayed, they will be absorbed by the markets. The extent, or even presence, of a drop remains uncertain. However, by September, the expectation is a renewed interest in altcoins due to potential altcoin ETF approvals, potentially priced in by the market earlier.

As it sped into Crypto Week on Tuesday, the U.S. House's process toward passing digital assets bills ground to a sudden halt over a procedural vote as members of the House Freedom Caucus objected to the way some of the legislation has developed under Senate dominance.



The misfire on the procedural vote quickly slammed the crypto markets over uncertainty about the good news expected this week as the House has moved toward passage of two of the industry's top priorities. The legislation still has strong, bipartisan support, suggesting the procedural mishap may be overcome as a further vote was scheduled for later Tuesday afternoon. More than a dozen Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the motion.



Two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk another vote has been aimed for 5:00 p.m. ET, meaning this disruption could be resolved without delaying the more important votes currently expected on Wednesday and Thursday.



U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republicans to vote in favor of the rule earlier Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, saying passing GENIUS would help keep the U.S. ahead of other countries in crypto development.



Bitcoin BTC$116,422.26 and ether (ETH) each knee-jerked lower by about 0.5% on the news, but both have recovered most of those declines. High-flying stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) has moved to its session low, down 5.3% on the day. The stock remains higher by roughly six-fold since its IPO last month.



Procedural disruptions can be the norm in the legislative process. As the GENIUS Act headed toward passage in the Senate, a group of Democrats slammed the breaks to object to certain provisions and force more discussion. It's uncertain whether a similar delay could be forced by unhappy Republicans on this week's bills.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

House Republicans today blocked a procedural motion that would have allowed formal consideration of several key crypto regulations, including the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC bills. The failed motion prevented all the measures from advancing through the chamber. Despite clearing the Rules Committee on Tuesday, the crypto bills could not reach the floor without the rule's approval. Majority Leader Steve Scalise had scheduled a vote to set the terms of debate, with final passage expected later this week.

Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to internal disagreements within the Republican caucus as the reason for the block. “We have some members who really, really want to emphasize the House's product,” Johnson said, referring to calls to merge the crypto bills into a single legislative package. This internal disagreement highlights the challenges faced by the Republican Party in reaching a consensus on crypto regulations.

The procedural failure also blocked consideration of a separate amendment that would have compelled the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's files, further inflaming tensions around the motion. This development underscores the broader political dynamics at play, where multiple issues are intertwined and influencing the legislative process.

The delay in the vote for the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC acts is significant as these bills aim to provide clarity and regulation for the crypto industry. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, while the CLARITY Act aims to provide regulatory certainty for stablecoins. The Anti-CBDC Act, on the other hand, is designed to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The blocking of these bills by House Republicans indicates a lack of consensus within the party on how to approach crypto regulation. This delay could have implications for the crypto industry, as it leaves uncertainty about the regulatory environment. The industry has been calling for clear guidelines to operate within, and the delay in these bills could hinder innovation and investment in the sector.

The failure to advance these bills also highlights the broader challenges faced by the legislative process in the United States. With internal disagreements and competing priorities, it can be difficult to pass legislation, even on issues with broad support. This delay in crypto regulation is just one example of the challenges faced by lawmakers in navigating complex political dynamics.

House Republicans today blocked a procedural motion that would have allowed formal consideration of several key crypto regulations, including the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC bills, a defense spending bill, and an amendment to release the Epstein files.

The motion failed by a vote of 196 to 223, with a majority of Republicans voting against it. As a result, the crypto legislation and related measures could not advance to floor debate or final passage.

Despite clearing the Rules Committee yesterday, the bills remained stalled without the rule's approval. Majority Leader Steve Scalise had scheduled the vote to set the terms of debate, with final passage expected later this week.

Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to internal disagreements within the Republican caucus. “We have some members who really, really want to emphasize the House's product,” Johnson said, referring to calls to merge the crypto bills into a single legislative package.

Majority Leader Steve Scalise echoed the internal divide, saying, “I was one of those who would like to see the whole package as one. But the president and the Senate really want us to move GENIUS first. The question is, do we play games with the Senate bill when the president has made it clear he wants GENIUS on his desk as it's written?”

The procedural failure also blocked consideration of a separate amendment that would have compelled the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's files.

Johnson said the House will vote again on the rule later this afternoon. For now, key crypto legislation and unrelated controversial amendments remain in limbo.

 Republicans are still planning to pass three pieces of crypto-related legislation, but a majority of members in the House voted against a resolution to consider the bills. 

Cryptocurrency-related bills backed by US President Donald Trump failed to clear a key procedural step in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, despite the president's public push for action. 

Trump had urged Republican lawmakers to “get the first vote done this afternoon” on legislation to regulate payment stablecoins as part of a larger effort to pass crypto legislation before the August recess.

In a Tuesday post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump ordered all Republicans to vote yes on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate payment stablecoins in the US. 

The legislation is one of three bills, along with ones to address market structure and central bank digital currencies, that Republican House leaders had been pushing as part of the party's “crypto week” plans.

The president may have been referring to a House resolution to consider the three bills and a defense bill, which failed to get support from a majority of lawmakers present on Tuesday — at least 13 Republicans may have voted against the resolution. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly said the chamber would take up another vote “this afternoon.”

The GENIUS Act, which passed through the Senate in June with bipartisan support despite initial resistance from many Democrats, is expected to head for a floor vote in the House by Thursday. At the time of publication, the bill was scheduled to be considered by the House sometime this week, but it was unclear whether the chamber planned a separate floor vote on Tuesday.

Trump has personally come under scrutiny for his role in pushing the stablecoin legislation due to his involvement in his family-backed crypto company World Liberty Financial (WLF), which issued its own stablecoin and suggested a conflict of interest. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Binance helped create WLF's USD1 stablecoin, also used by an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm to settle a $2 billion investment into the crypto exchange. 

“World Liberty Financial has received a significant portion of its funding from overseas, which has brought about serious ethical and national security concerns,” said California Representative Maxine Waters' office on Tuesday, adding: “[F]oreign investment is not just a business deal, it's a direct payment to the sitting US president with the goal of currying favor and influence within the White House.”

Many Democratic leaders have responded to Republicans' push for the digital assets bills with their own “anti-crypto corruption week” agenda. They are calling for amendments in the three bills to address consumer protection and prevent the president, vice president, and members of Congress from holding or promoting crypto over concerns with conflicts of interest.

Two new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) targeting Solana SOL$160.69 and XRP XRP$2.8729 are launching in the U.S. on Tuesday, marking another step in the expanding intersection of traditional finance and digital assets.



ProShares, a major player in leveraged ETFs, rolled out the ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON) and the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP). Both products aim to deliver twice the daily performance of their respective underlying cryptocurrencies, but do so using regulated futures contracts — not by holding the tokens themselves, ProShares said in a press release.



The launches follow confirmation from NYSE Arca, which certified the “approval for listing” of both funds in coordination with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to two letters filed Monday.



While these ETFs won't offer investors direct exposure to the price movements of SOL or XRP, their arrival on U.S. exchanges reflects growing institutional comfort with crypto-backed products — particularly when tied to regulated derivatives markets.



Futures-based ETFs have historically played a role in paving the way for spot-based versions. The presence of a regulated futures market can help regulators gauge liquidity, pricing mechanisms and investor protection, all key factors in evaluating applications for spot ETFs.



Several asset managers, including VanEck and Bitwise, currently have active proposals with the SEC for spot Solana and spot XRP ETFs. The SEC has not yet approved any spot ETFs tied to either asset, but futures-based products like SLON and UXRP could influence that path.



The new funds also speak to increasing demand from traders and institutions looking for leveraged exposure to major altcoins, even as the regulatory picture for spot crypto products continues to evolve.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday publicly called on all Republicans to vote in favor of the GENIUS Act, a sweeping crypto bill aimed at positioning the United States as the global leader in digital assets during what is now being billed as "Crypto Week."

What Happened: Taking to social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “Happy Crypto Week! The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets – Nobody does it better!"

Calling the GENIUS Act "tremendous," Trump said it would put the U.S. "lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others," and asked that "ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!" 

The move signals his administration's growing embrace of crypto-friendly policy, setting a sharp contrast with regulatory approaches under previous leadership.

“It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE,” Trump stressed in idiosyncratic fashion.

Why It Matters: The GENIUS Act, short for Guiding Enhanced National Innovation for Unified Standards, is expected to clarify how cryptocurrencies are regulated across federal agencies.

Provisions in the bill address key industry issues like token classification, stablecoin frameworks, and U.S. competitiveness in blockchain development.

This vote comes amid "Crypto Week," an unofficial term used by industry insiders to describe the flurry of legislative and executive activity this week in support of digital assets. 

Alongside the GENIUS Act, additional bills are expected to clarify how securities laws apply to blockchain tokens and establish new rules for stablecoin issuance.

While not expected to impact price action in major currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD, the bills will impact the regulatory framework cryptocurrencies like XRP XRP/USD operate under.

The GENIUS Act is seen by supporters as the first concrete step toward creating a U.S.-led digital economy infrastructure.

House lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill later today.

 The California Breakthrough Project held its first meeting at Ripple's San Francisco headquarters, according to journalist Eleanor Terrett. 

California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a new government efficiency task force that includes representatives from various crypto firms, potentially signaling the state's recognition that blockchain technology could enhance public services.

The task force, dubbed California Breakthrough Project, has tapped executives from Ripple, Coinbase, MoonPay and others to “advise and advance government efficiency and collaboration,” journalist Eleanor Terrett reported Tuesday. 

According to Terrett, the task force held its inaugural meeting at Ripple's San Francisco headquarters on June 6. It aims to foster collaboration between California regulators and industry leaders across the technology and business sectors, address government inefficiencies and boost transparency around public services.

The project was confirmed by Governor Newsom, who issued the following statement:

Although Newsom's announcement did not clarify whether, or how, blockchain technology would support the project's mission, California is home to hundreds of blockchain companies that could offer insights into fostering innovation and transparency in government services.

According to the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency's Interagency Web3 Report, nearly one-quarter of the approximately 800 blockchain companies in North America are headquartered in the state.

The report suggests that California's thriving blockchain sector presents “an opportunity for leveraging new types of blockchain entrepreneurship and consumer interest.”

California's move to engage crypto firms comes amid growing regulatory momentum for digital assets in the United States, with stablecoin and market structure legislation currently in development.

Newsom's announcement also coincided with US Crypto Week, during which the House of Representatives is set to debate and vote on several crypto-related bills.

The week started with the House Committee on Rules reviewing the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act and the GENIUS Act, a comprehensive framework for US dollar stablecoins.

Popular Solana token launchpad Pump.fun debuted its token on Monday, immediately entering the top 65 tokens by market cap. It followed a massive $600 million initial coin offering, or ICO, that sold out in just 12 minutes over the weekend.

Still, PUMP remains below BONK in terms of market cap, a meme coin project that is butting heads with Pump.fun as it steals Solana launchpad market share.

At the time of writing, Pump.fun sits at a market capitalization of $2 billion, according to CoinGecko, making it the 63rd largest cryptocurrency. To put that into perspective, that puts the project above the official meme coin for U.S. President Donald Trump and Sam Altman's World, formerly known as Worldcoin.

But rival project BONK is currently trading at a market cap of $2.23 billion—$230 million ahead of PUMP. To be clear, BONK launched as a Solana meme coin in late 2022. By January, it had started to pick up steam, slid, and then pumped as the developers burned 5 trillion coins to buoy the price.

The team and community that created Bonk have gone on to create a Telegram trading tool BonkBot, a dog charity Buddies for Paws, and more. Meme coin launchpad LetsBonk, which debuted in April, is the latest of those projects.

Last week, LetsBonk flipped Pump.fun in daily created tokens and has remained on top for seven out of the last eight days, according to Dune data. The launchpad was created by the Bonk meme coin community, hence its shared name with the token.

LetsBonk is very similar to Pump.fun in that it allows anyone to quickly launch tokens for free. However, LetsBonk also lets the deployer control the total token supply and is underpinned by Raydium's LaunchLab infrastructure.

Comparing the PUMP and BONK tokens isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, as the team behind the OG Solana meme coin has a wider catalogue of offerings. Bonk is integrated into dozens of DeFi projects, games, and dev tools, and even has its own stadium sponsorship. Whereas PUMP—which is a token and not a meme coin—is solely focused on Pump.fun.

That said, Pump.fun is undeniably one of the largest crypto projects to emerge in recent years, becoming the fastest crypto company to hit $100 million in revenue last year. Since then, it has topped $784 million in revenue, according to Dune data.

The platform allows anyone to create a Solana token in less than a minute, free of charge. It has resulted in more than 11.89 million tokens being created since its January 2024 launch, many of which have been viral successes—think Moo Deng, Fartcoin, and Chill Guy.

More recently, the project has invested more into expanding its streamer ecosystem by funding big streamer projects and paying users to post viral clips of their favorite Pump.fun creators.

Those bullish on PUMP are now eagerly awaiting details on when the launchpad will airdrop tokens to users of the platform. In its tokenomics, 24% of the supply was dedicated to “Community & Ecosystem initiatives,” which many believe suggests an airdrop is on its way. Predictors on Myriad Markets believe there is a 47.7% chance that Pump.fun airdrops by the end of July.

Pump.fun declined to respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.)

Throughout its first day of trading, PUMP has remained fairly stable, hitting a low of $0.0049, a high of $0.0061, and is currently sitting at $0.0055. At its peak, it was trading at a 65% premium over its ICO price of $.004.

According to Dune data, this prompted 21.6% of ICO participants to sell the token via decentralized exchanges and 43.4% to transfer it out of their wallets. It's worth noting that transferring tokens does not mean that the trader sold the tokens; moving tokens could simply mean splitting tokens among wallets.

Plus, 31.8% of public sale buyers have held their tokens, with 3.2% even acquiring more tokens post-launch.

Due to its lack of volatility, there doesn't appear to be any big winners trading PUMP yet with the top traders, according to DEX Screener, requiring millions of dollars to make sizable profits.

As you can expect, a stream of knock-off coins were launched alongside PUMP, including the Official Pump—which is very much not official. It peaked at a $3.13 million market cap and has since crashed 74.75%.

SharpLink Gaming acquired $225 million worth of Ethereum earlier this month, the company said in a press release on Tuesday, adding to its industry-leading holdings. 

The Minneapolis, Minnesota-based firm now said it now owns roughly 280,000 Ethereum worth $846 million. The company first purchased the asset just over a month ago.

As of Tuesday, the Ethereum Foundation owned around 217,500 Ethereum worth $655 million across several networks, according to crypto analytics platform Arkham Intelligence. The platform shows at least 17 entities holding more Ethereum than SharpLink, but they include smart contracts and exchanges that may not own the Ethereum they control.

SharpLink shares spiked 3.6% to $24.76 on Tuesday, according to Yahoo Finance. As Ethereum's price has climbed above the $3,000 mark, SharpLink's stock price has soared more than 160% over the past month, mirroring the gains of some other Ethereum treasury firms.

Most crypto treasury firms seek to maximize shareholder value by growing the amount of digital assets they own per fully diluted share. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor pioneered a Bitcoin-buying playbook that many firms have sought to emulate this year, but SharpLink's strategy is aimed at leveraging Ethereum's relatively distinct qualities.

This month, SharpLink said that it has so far earned approximately 94 Ethereum worth $283,000 through staking rewards, for example. Over 99% of the company's ETH holdings are allocated to protocols that let it participate in the process of validating Ethereum transactions.

SharpLink said that it also raised $413 million in proceeds from the sale of 24 million common shares, while holding $257 million in cash that has yet to be devoted to the asset.

The company noted that the amount of Ethereum it holds for every 1,000 assumed diluted shares outstanding, or SharpLink's “ETH concentration,” has increased to 2.46 Ethereum from 2 Ethereum, a 23% increase compared to 32 days ago.

The company's stock plunged last month moments after a registration-of-shares filing became effective, similar to Solana treasury firm Upexi. SharpLink shares had soared as high as $124 before the collapse, which stemmed from institutions' profit-taking.

On X, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, who chairs SharpLink's board, described buying pressure from other Ethereum treasury firms as an “industrial shop vacuum” mopping up Ethereum's excess supply so “supply-demand dynamics are tightly balanced.”

On Monday, Bitcoin miner BitMine said that it had recently raised $250 million through a private placement to buy Ethereum. The company's board is being led by Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner and Head of Research Tom Lee.

“Count me as a member,” Lee said on X on Monday, responding to a metaphorical hat tip from Lubin, who called himself a “self-appointed representative of The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen.”

Here's the deal. Crypto payroll integration isn't just a passing trend; it's a full-blown revolution. With big names like Apple toying with blockchain solutions, the potential for decentralized payments in tech is starting to show its face, and it looks promising. Let's take a closer look at how this crypto payroll for startups scene is shaping up.

These days, it seems like everyone is jumping on the crypto payroll bandwagon, especially startups eager to harness the magic of blockchain tech. By using stablecoins—like USDC for freelancer invoicing—companies can ensure payments are quick and immune to the wild price swings that come with most cryptocurrencies. This isn't just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how businesses are getting their money where it needs to go.

And the creative sector? It's getting a serious makeover thanks to blockchain payments. More and more companies are waking up to the benefits of decentralized payroll tools, which not only speed up payment processes but also lighten the administrative load. With crypto payroll platforms, businesses can hire remote developers globally, tapping into talent without the usual geographical restrictions. This is especially useful in gaming and digital content creation, where timely payments keep the creative juices flowing.

Now, let's talk about the good stuff. Decentralized payroll solutions come with a bag full of perks that traditional systems can't match. 

First off, cost efficiency. Bye-bye, middlemen and those annoying transaction fees. Then there's the instant payments, which are, well, instant. No more waiting for the bank to open to get paid. And, of course, transparency and trust. With blockchain, every transaction is recorded, making it hard to pull a fast one.

These benefits are especially attractive as remote work becomes the new normal. Businesses are on the lookout for ways to make their operations smoother, and this seems like a solid option.

But hold up, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The road ahead has bumps. Regulatory fragmentation is a major pain point. Different countries have their own rules about using crypto, and companies need to stay on the right side of the law—especially in the gaming and metaverse spaces where things can get complicated.

Then there's the volatility factor. Cryptos can swing wildly, and not everyone wants to be paid in something that might tank overnight. Some businesses might just stick to stablecoins for payroll, which seems to be a safer bet.

As we peer into the crystal ball, it looks like crypto payroll in tech is here to stay. The perks of decentralized payroll solutions, paired with the growing acceptance of blockchain, suggest that crypto payments are set to become a mainstream option. By embracing these changes, companies could streamline their operations and attract the talent needed to thrive in a digital world.

Yeah, the evolution of crypto payroll integration isn't just about new payment methods. It's about rethinking what compensation looks like in the modern workforce. As more companies see the potential of blockchain payments, we may soon find ourselves in a world where crypto payroll isn't just an option—it's the norm.

Bitcoin has broken records, but the rest of the crypto market is still playing catch-up.

While top cryptocurrency tore through $123,000 this week, most altcoins — everything that isn't Bitcoin — are lagging behind.

So, when are the cryptocurrencies not named Bitcoin going to enjoy their bull market?

“For a full-scale altcoin rally, we need two things: profit rotation and confidence,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News. 

“Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively.”

For now, it's a one-man show. 

This month, Bitcoin has enjoyed a 12% price rally as three crypto bills worm their way through Washington, exchange-traded fund inflows remain stable, a wave of corporates buy Bitcoin, and the anticipation the Federal Reserve cutting interest rate grows.

Altcoin season — the market phase when tokens like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP outperform Bitcoin — is often seen as the next leg in the crypto cycle. 

But Enzersdorfer-Konrad says we're not quite there yet.

“The biggest driver for altcoin performance in the coming weeks and months is going to be investor sentiment and overall risk appetite,” he said.

The setup may be forming.

Bitcoin is consolidating near all-time highs. And real yields are still low — a recipe, Enzersdorfer-Konrad says, for capital to flow into higher-risk bets like DeFi, gaming tokens, and tokenised real-world assets.

Still, the spark hasn't lit.

That's because Bitcoin is yet to consolidate at a price level, allowing investors to start moving down the risk curve.

Enzersdorfer-Konrad is cautious about whether that will soon translate into new price records for the likes of Ethereum, XRP and Solana. 

A lot “will depend on overall market sentiment, global liquidity, and whether investors are ready to move further out on the risk curve,” he said. 

“It's less about individual names and more about the broader setup taking shape.”

            By Zak Thomas-Akoo
            - 15 Jul, 2025          


In a three-page objection filed on 14 July, Massachusetts resident Brad Wyatt, a former top 10 holder of NFL Reignmaker NFTs, criticised the Plan of Allocation's use of “Prize Receipts” as a deduction in calculating how much each class member will receive.

He claimed the approach distorts economic reality and undermines the settlement's goal of compensating harmed investors.

Wyatt is the third class member to object to the settlement, following two earlier objections submitted in May.

The lawsuit, led by plaintiff Justin Dufoe, alleges that DraftKings violated federal securities law by offering NFTs as unregistered investment contracts.

DraftKings denies wrongdoing but agreed in April to a mediated settlement that includes a $10m fund for affected users, with up to $50,000 set aside for service awards and 25% for legal fees.

Wyatt's objection centres on the formula used to determine “Individual Recognised Loss” (IR), which includes deductions for “Prize Receipts” (PR) from fantasy contests run separately on the DraftKings platform.

He said: “Including these Prize Receipts does not offset the economic harm suffered by class members as the proposed settlement regarding the purchase and sale of NFT securities on DraftKings Marketplace is unrelated to potential realised or unrealised prize receipts from playing in DraftKings Fantasy Sport skill-based contests”.

He further alleged that DraftKings inflated the fair market value of these prizes and that their inclusion in the formula results in “an unfair reduction of each class action participant's NFT owners' Individual Recognised Loss.”

Wyatt urged the court to adopt a revised formula that excludes Prize Receipts altogether, arguing that doing so would “better adhere to securities law principles and promote a more equitable distribution of damages”.

According to transaction data provided by DraftKings, Wyatt spent nearly $462,000 acquiring NFTs on the primary and secondary markets, but only received around $245,000 in resale and marketplace closure proceeds.

Prize Receipts accounted for an additional $252,000 in notional value, which Wyatt argues should not be treated as offsetting cash.

DraftKings shut down its NFT marketplace in March 2024, just weeks after the federal court declined to dismiss the securities lawsuit.

In the settlement memorandum, Dufoe's lawyers noted that the timing “suggests an awareness of litigation risk” and argued the $10m fund represents “an outstanding result” given the uncertain legal landscape.

A final approval hearing has yet to be scheduled, and objections remain open until 21 days before that date.

The court will determine whether to approve the deal as fair, reasonable and adequate in light of the objections raised.

A new weekly “On Chain” report from Bank of America is shining a spotlight on Ethereum. According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress.

Ethereum's role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike.

Stablecoin Legislation Under The Lens

Based on reports, this week's Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill.

House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar's global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows.

Rails For The Future

Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure.

That nod isn't just for the token itself. It's a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum's code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. Institutions Bet On Ether 

The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts.

Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum.

Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale.

It isn't all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum's lead. Still, the network's mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start.

For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

Altcoin season is around the corner, and two projects are gaining huge traction. TAO is gaining attention for its utility, and Nexchain is gaining serious attention as the best crypto presale to buy right now. 

This cutting-edge project merges AI and blockchain in a way that brings real utility. The current presale crypto tokens price sits at $0.086, offering early access in Stage 22. 

Every stage adds value, and crypto coins on presale with verified audits are rare Nexchain meets that trust standard. 

With crypto presale projects expanding in appeal, Nexchain stands out on any crypto presale list. 

Investors are drawn by transparency: clear stages, published audits, and secure hybrid consensus. This new crypto token presale isn't just hype it's building. 

Nexchain offers both pre-sale cryptocurrency innovation and real-world infrastructure. If you want to buy presale crypto, this token presale delivers a fusion of technology and trust.

Nexchain is a revolutionary blockchain ecosystem that is completely AI-powered. The Nexchain token presale has already begun, with a reduced price that grows with every presale stage.

The Nexchain AI sets a new standard for decentralized systems with unprecedented speed. By merging Proof-of-Stake mechanisms with NEX AI, an innovative Hybrid Consensus ensures exceptional performance and flexibility. 

With the support of next-generation smart contracts, NEX allows for smooth interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems.

A $5M bounty in NEX is up for the taking through Nexchain's community-driven challenge. Participants complete missions and climb weekly and final leaderboards. 

Nexchain's airdrop stands out as one of the largest and most structured in the Web3 space. The campaign features a $5,000,000 reward pool in $NEX tokens, distributed through weekly leaderboards (every 7 days) and a grand final leaderboard at the end of the campaign. Weekly rewards range from $500 (1,667 NEX) for ranks 11–25, up to $10,000 (33,333 NEX) for the #1 spot. Participants can complete up to 4 types of quests — Social, Presale, Testnet, and Referral — with every action contributing points to boost leaderboard position and unlock exclusive prizes like NFTs, mystery boxes, and guaranteed rewards for full task completion.

Bittensor (TAO) is a groundbreaking platform that stands at the intersection of blockchain technology and machine learning. It is designed as a decentralized network that fundamentally changes how artificial intelligence (AI) is developed, shared, and monetized. 

By utilizing a peer-to-peer intelligence market, Bittensor enables miners to contribute to the training of machine learning models, rewarding them with tokens for the value they provide.

The live Bittensor price today is $390.87 USD.

As cryptocurrency usage increases, two future projects—Aigent and WeWake—are addressing the space's most persistent issues: complexity and accessibility. 

Aigent is releasing a one-click AI agent builder that allows users to build, tokenize, and trade artificial agents without writing code or maintaining wallets. This method makes the on-chain AI economy more accessible to non-technical consumers. The presale is slated for June, and whitelist access is currently available.

Meanwhile, WeWake concentrates on resolving Web3's onboarding issues. Its plug-and-play gateway enables users to explore DeFi, dApps, and blockchain technologies without the need for wallets, gas tokens, or seed words. Everything operates with a single, straightforward click.

Together, Aigent and WeWake signify a transition toward more practical, user-centered systems. By reducing technical barriers, they are making powerful crypto technologies available to a far larger audience, establishing the stage for the next wave of popular use in AI and Web3.

Nexchain combines AI and blockchain in a transparent, audited presale structure that's easy to join. It leads the list of top crypto presales with clear tokenomics and stage-based pricing. 

With real-world use cases like hybrid consensus and revenue sharing, it adds depth beyond typical crypto ICO presale hype. 

Nexchain's trusted framework makes it a strong contender for anyone looking at crypto presale projects focused on long-term impact.Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

Bitcoin and most altcoins pulled back on Tuesday, raising concerns among investors about whether the crypto bull run is over.

Bitcoin (BTC) plunged from Monday's high of $123,200 to $116,600, while the market capitalization of all coins fell by over 3.7% to $3.65 trillion. Some of the worst-performing tokens were Pump (PUMP), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), SPX6900 (SPX), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), respectively. 

Bitcoin and most altcoins declined due to profit-taking among investors. It is common for cryptocurrencies and stocks to pull back slightly after going parabolic. For example, BTC reached a record high of $109,389 in January, then pulled back to $74,450 in April.

Cryptocurrencies are also falling as market participants await the outcome of “Crypto Week.” Republicans will consider three bills this week, including CLARITY, GENIUS, and one related to central bank digital currencies.

The GENIUS Act, which passed in a bipartisan manner in the Senate, sets the rules for stablecoins. CLARITY aims to divide the cryptocurrency regulatory roles between the SEC and the CFTC, while the CBDC bill prohibits the Fed from working on these currencies.

Therefore, Bitcoin and altcoins are falling because market participants are not sure whether these bills will pass in Congress. Many of them remember Donald Trump's “Infrastructure Week” during his first term. His goal was to secure $1 trillion to fund the country's infrastructure, which did not materialize.

Further, these coins are likely falling due to the concept known as “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Cryptocurrencies surged ahead of “Crypto Week” and are now declining as the event unfolds.

The crypto pullback is also happening due to technical factors. The chart above shows that Bitcoin price formed a shooting star pattern on Monday. This pattern, characterized by a small body and a long upper shadow, is one of the most common bearish reversal signals.

Bitcoin is also falling due to mean reversion, where an asset returns to its historical averages. In this case, BTC surged above $123,000 on Monday, significantly higher than the 100-day moving average of $103,000 and the 50-day average of $108,200. As such, mean reversion suggests that BTC may keep falling to bridge this gap.

Bitcoin also appears to be executing a break-and-retest pattern by moving back to the key support at $110,000. This B&R pattern is a common continuation signal in technical analysis.

Therefore, this is unlikely to mark the end of the crypto bull run. The more probable scenario is that BTC drops to $110,000 and then resumes its uptrend, potentially triggering another rally among altcoins.

Oops, something went wrong

Amaze Holdings (NYSE:AMZE) launched a new cryptocurrency initiative on Tuesday. The initiative aims to modernize payments, boost monetization, and enhance financial flexibility.

This move builds on the company's recent rollout of Express Checkout and expanded payment offerings.

Amaze is partnering with DNA Fund to develop blockchain-based payment and treasury solutions as part of the initiative.

“Partnering with DNA Fund accelerates our ability to reduce cross-border payment friction and deliver faster, more flexible solutions to our growing base of international creators,” said Aaron Day, CEO of Amaze.

Day added that the collaboration enables the company to offer new payment options to over 13 million creators, while also improving the purchasing experience for millions of visitors to the platform.

He stated that the partnership opens the door to broader opportunities—such as providing creators access to funding and helping them build sustainable businesses—marking a critical step toward becoming a true partner in the global creator economy.

Within 60–90 days, Amaze will roll out Phase One, focused on stablecoin integration to accelerate international transactions and reduce costs.

According to DNA Fund Chairman Brock Pierce, future phases may include digital treasury tools, creator-focused financial services, and a potential “Amaze Coin,” all developed with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance.

Price Action: At the last check on Tuesday, AMZE shares were trading higher by 2.89% at $11.73 premarket.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Crypto and banking are drawing ever closer. Big banks like JPMorgan and Citi are exploring digital asset integrations, and big crypto companies like Circle and Ripple are applying for bank charters. Dakota, a neobank cofounded by a former Coinbase executive, aims to combine both corners of finance—and investors are betting it'll succeed.

On Tuesday, the startup announced that it had raised $12.5 million in a Series A led by the crypto venture firm CoinFund. Other participants included 6th Man Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and Triton Ventures. (Triton is the venture arm of the crypto exchange Kraken). 





The raise was purely for equity, said Ryan Bozarth, cofounder and CEO of Dakota. He declined to specify his startup's valuation. “Dakota [was] one of the first companies I had seen in the Web3 payment space that had a significant share of non-crypto customers,” Alex Felix, chief investment officer at CoinFund, told Fortune.





The injection of capital into Dakota, which uses stablecoins to move money between itself and its customers, is the latest bet from VCs on a company involved in one of the buzziest sectors of crypto. Stablecoins are tokens pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, and proponents claim they can speed up cross-border payments and reduce transaction fees.





While stablecoins are more than a decade old, the asset class has taken center stage this past year after interest from large fintechs and regulatory progress on Capitol Hill. In February, Stripe acquired the stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion. And, in June, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that aims to regulate the tokens.




Bozarth is a veteran of Big Tech. He's worked at Sony, Square, and Airbnb. He's also a former Coinbase executive who managed the U.S. crypto exchange's custody arm, or portion of the business that holds large amounts of crypto on behalf of corporate clients.





In 2022, Bozarth left Coinbase to found Dakota. Just like the Dakotas, which were once on the frontier of the U.S.'s territorial acquisitions westward, his startup is on the frontier of what he calls “pioneering technology.”





His neobank functions much like any other bank. It has checking accounts and provides users, mainly businesses, yield on the money they've deposited. But instead of relying on decades-old financial technology, it uses stablecoins to move money between it and its many banking partners. (Dakota does not have its own bank charter but is regulated in the U.S. and Europe as a money services business, said Bozarth.)





Over the past year, it's processed about $1.6 billion in transaction volume and is on pace to record $4 billion by December, Bozarth said. Dakota has more than 500 businesses using its platform, the majority of which are outside the U.S., he added.





“For a lot of folks outside of the U.S., access to a kind of U.S.-style bank account, or U.S. dollar-denominated account, is an incredibly valuable feature in itself,” said Bozarth.

Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor.

Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, vaulted over $120,000 for the first time on Monday, the opening day of what Republicans in the House of Representatives have dubbed “Crypto Week.”

Lawmakers are poised to consider three major pieces of legislation that supporters say will “make America the crypto capital of the world.” Those in less sexy asset classes will have to dream of a future Fixed Income Friday on Capitol Hill.

Bitcoin, which is up roughly 30% this year and did pare its gains back below $120,000, was not alone, as other leading cryptocurrencies Ether, Solana and Chainlink advanced on Monday. The trio of bills before Congress — the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the Senate's GENIUS stablecoin package.

The CLARITY Act, if passed, would lay the groundwork for a regulatory framework for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Providing this kind of certainty would likely encourage traditional institutional investors like asset management firms, hedge funds, and banks — some of which have kept a cautious approach to crypto due to a lack of clarity around legal compliance — to grab their knees and plunge in. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing its own central bank digital currency – if passed, that would amount to lawmakers articulating a preference for market-driven innovation in the crypto space over state-led initiatives. 

Then there's arguably the most important bill that's fuelling the crypto rally: the GENIUS Act. This bill would establish a federal framework for stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that has a constant value, often via a 1:1 peg to the dollar. The bill would require them to be backed by liquid assets like dollars or Treasury bonds, and issuers would have to disclose their reserve holdings. Stablecoin use has grown considerably in recent months, and many believe they could be used for instant payments — Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, which would allow them to skip billions in traditional financial transaction fees. The optimism is already registering in crypto and traditional markets:

Strategic Antics: The GENIUS Act received bipartisan support in the Senate and is most likely to reach President Donald Trump's desk first. But many Democrats are opposed, as well as to the CLARITY Act, which critics have argued contains threadbare protections for consumers and against fraud. In other words, prepare for an engrossing series of hours-long CSPAN still-camera shots of debates over amendments.

The big US banks bested Q1 earnings expectations, and many observers expect big boosts to their Q2 trading desk revenues. 

The dollar is the most important currency on earth, adding up to 57.7% of global currency reserves in the first quarter. 

A planned 50% tariff on copper has left commodities markets roiling and analysts toiling with the idea consumers paying for higher prices. 

Even after TikTok is kicked off app stores later this year, the current app will keep working for US users until March. 

Thiel's bank, named after the mountain where the dragon Smaug hoards his treasure, plans to serve tech startups and crypto companies.  

The US debt is about the same as its entire economic output and is projected to grow if Trump's megabill passes. 

The current surge in energy demand is virtually unprecedented since the mass effort to electrify America immediately following World War II. 

The S&P 500's recent record high marked an encouraging sign that markets are no longer all that concerned with worst-case trade war scenarios. 

Ford said that its second quarter sales rocketed 14% in the second quarter from a year earlier to 612,095 vehicles. 

Experts have already warned that rollbacks to electric vehicle tax incentives will slow sales growth big time. 

In May, POTUS scrapped the “de minimis” exemption that allowed Shein and Temu to ship packages worth less than $800 to the US duty-free. 

Rising temperatures and massive new data centers are providing a massive stress test for the US power grid.

If you haven't heard of stablecoins yet — chances are you will soon.

There is perhaps no hotter segment in the cryptocurrency world at the moment than stablecoins. Companies like Amazon or Walmart are considering adopting them, while big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are exploring launching their own stablecoins, according to The Wall Street Journal.

What's more, Congress is on the verge of adopting legislation this week that would provide a formal framework for the sector, effectively making stablecoins part of U.S. regulations.

There's a reason behind the excitement. As a concept, stablecoins are pretty groundbreaking in the world of money.

A key vision behind stablecoins is that people and companies should be able to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous banks or money transfer companies, that take time and charge fees, getting in the way.

But as detractors point out, there are real risks to stablecoins. Unlike the money we know, stablecoins are still new and regulations are still evolving. The relatively recent set of rules and its ease of use have also attracted shady actors like drug dealers and ransomware hackers.

So what are stablecoins? Here are three things to know.

Unlike other types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have a secret weapon that are meant to make them far safer.

That's because as the name implies, each stablecoin is meant to be stable. This is how it works: If you buy a stablecoin that's worth $1, the issuer that provided you with that stablecoin has to keep $1 in reserve, so that when you want to cash it you can get paid back promptly. (Dollars are primarily used to back stablecoins, but euros or some other asset of value like gold can also be used).

NPR's Planet Money — and others — have perhaps the neatest analogy.

Stablecoins are like the chips you get in a casino. Say you pay the cashier $100 and you get $100 in chips to gamble. Once you are done, you return whatever chips you have gained — or have left — and get the corresponding amount from the casino.

The issuer should be able to pay you back, just like you trust the casino will have the money when you go to cash in your chips.

It's probably the reason why stablecoins today are mainly used to buy and trade other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, because of the ease with which they can be converted to cash.


                Stablecoins are used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which is currently trading at record highs.

The biggest company in this arena is Tether, which has a stablecoin called USDT and is based in El Salvador. The second is Circle, which issues a stablecoin called USDC.

Even President Trump is involved in stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, in which his family has financial interests, has issued one called USD1, meaning the president stands to benefit financially from the increased adoption of stablecoins (though as of now USD1 has a miniscule market share).

At the moment, the stablecoin market is worth just over $250 billion, but it's growing fast. Citigroup projects that the total amount of outstanding stablecoin could hit $1.6 to $3.7 trillion by 2030.

Congress is also on the verge of adopting legislation that would provide a formal framework for the sector, effectively making stablecoins part of U.S. regulations.

The GENIUS Act was passed by the Senate last month, and the House is expected to consider the legislation this week. (The acronym stands for "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin".)

Among other aspects, the Act mandates that stablecoin issuers must hold proper one-to-one reserves and seeks to ensure that issuers are obeying anti-money laundering rules — though critics deride the measures as too weak.

The real excitement around stablecoins is that they provide a real-life advantage: They can make transferring money easier in a world where digital wallets and mobile payments are becoming more and more common.

In some developing countries, where dollars aren't easily accessible, companies with an international trading business are already starting to use stablecoin to expedite money transfers from their partners, transactions that usually take days or weeks through the traditional banking system.

With stablecoin, payments across companies can be transferred instantaneously at a fraction of the costs even if they are in different countries.

Such payments were estimated at a mere $6 billion in February, a very small sliver of the market — but those in the industry see its potential.

Yellow Card, a stablecoin payments company with offices in 16 African countries, says it facilitates these types of transactions. CEO Chris Maurice says stablecoins provide a "bridge" for companies to interact with the global economy.

"It doesn't matter what industry you're in, it doesn't matter if you're in financial services or you're in the business of selling shoes on the side of the road. Everybody has the same set of issues when it comes to payments, especially international payments," says Maurice.


                Stablecoins could make international transactions easier in emerging markets where dollars are not that easily accessible. In the picture, a man in Kampala, Uganda, reflects exchange rate changes on a board on Jan. 20, 2024.

And it's not just companies — there are potential advantages for regular folks too.

Big retailers such as Amazon are hoping to benefit from stablecoins because they would no longer have to pay billions of dollars in fees for credit card transactions.

Buying something on Amazon or Walmart may seem instantaneous. But retailers have to pay fees and completing an entire transaction with different credit card companies or banks can take days.

"What people don't know is the payments that we all make every day, day to day, and the payments that institutions make back and forth to each other sometimes takes as much as a week to fully settle out and costs a fair amount of money for a fairly simple transaction," says Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy Officer at crypto exchange Coinbase.

Stablecoins however can make that process faster.

"I think we're on the verge of a payment revolution in the United States," he adds.

There's a question that still lingers: Are stablecoins actually safe?

When you get a stablecoin, you are effectively trusting that the company selling it to you is actually holding the equivalent dollars in reserves.

Stablecoin companies bristle at the question, and they are adamant that they safeguard their customers' money by parking them in ultra-safe investments such as U.S. Treasury bills.

But the concerns linger. New York's attorney general investigated Tether and crypto exchange Bifinex, accusing the two companies of not maintaining proper one-to-one reserves. The companies denied that, but the case was settled in 2021 with a $18.5 million fine, with the two crypto firms agreeing to be more transparent about their reserves.


                Stablecoins, if adopted, could reduce the fees merchants such as Amazon must pay to credit cards.

John Reed Stark, a former top financial regulator who served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement, is a prominent critic of cryptocurrencies. He says it is a big leap of faith to believe that stablecoin companies are properly holding reserves backing the stablecoin.

"In most instances, we have no visibility to any stablecoins, no public audits, no examinations, no inspections — who knows what is really going on?," Reed Stark says.

He adds that even though it might seem more onerous, the current payment system has checks and balances in place via credit card companies or banks, which offer "a critical beneficial role for all consumers."

There's the other big concern about stablecoins: They are suspected of being used by all kinds of illicit actors like drug dealers and scammers who need a way to transfer money and access the cash without being detected by regulators or the police.

"Even though you can see every payment on the Internet, you don't necessarily know who it's from and who it's to," says Darrell Duffie at Stanford University, who teaches finance and management. And he adds, there are ways for people to "mask" their transactions to make them harder to detect.

Critics worry that stablecoins could even pose a threat to the financial system.

One of the biggest fears is that they will suffer the equivalent of a run on the bank, like Silicon Valley Bank which collapsed in 2023. A similar scenario could play out if customers rush en masse to cash in their stablecoins — and the issuers find themselves unable to pay back customers.

An event like that could have knock-on effects across the financial sector, just like the 2008 global financial crisis showed how trouble in one area of the financial system can quickly spread.

Stablecoin issuers are holding many of their customer reserves at traditional lenders, weaving in the banking system into the stablecoin sector. And stablecoin issuers also keep a huge chunk of their money in U.S. Treasury bills, which is a common practice across the sector.

So a run on the bank could force stablecoin companies to quickly draw in their reserves at traditional lenders and lead them to sell off their U.S. debt in a hurry, thus sparking intense volatility.

There's debate about how dire the threat would be, but that tension is still at the heart of the debate over stablecoins.

They have real-life potential — but they are a relatively new financial product, one that critics fear will open up all kinds of risks that may not be so apparent right now, leading to unintended consequences.

An earlier version of the story incorrectly said Circle was the biggest stablecoin issuer while Tether was the second biggest. In fact, it's the reverse: Tether issues the most and Circle the second-most.

The price of bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, marked another significant milestone Monday following record-breaking highs last week as lawmakers debate three pieces of legislation that will shape the market, experts said.

“Bitcoin is moving up, silver is moving up, gold is moving up,” said Andrew Rocco, stock strategist at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Research. 

The rally on the digital currency, which hit the $120,000 mark for the first time Monday, comes during "crypto week," Rocco said, when the House of Representatives is scheduled to debate legislation that could create a legal framework for crypto exchanges and issuers to operate in. On Friday, bitcoin broke $118,000 for the first time.  

“The Trump administration and politicians on both sides of the aisle are pushing for that regulatory clarity this week,” Rocco said, but critics of the proposed bills say they do little to protect consumer investors and give issuers too much freedom.

“These bills could sow the seeds of the next financial crisis because they are regulatory wolves in sheep's clothing," said Mark Hays, associate director for cryptocurrency and financial technology at Americans for Financial Reform, a progressive non-profit that advocates for stronger Wall Street regulations.

The House will weigh three crypto bills this week:

Locally, New York Attorney General Letitia James early this month urged congressional leaders to strengthen the GENIUS Act to regulate issuers of stablecoin, such as banks, to combat the anonymous use of the currency in criminal activity and transactions.

Here are three things to know about bitcoin's rally and crypto week:

One major factor behind the recent rally on bitcoin, Rocco said, is that investors and crypto businesses believe that the week's scheduled bill votes will bring regulatory clarity.

For years, many in the industry have complained that “one of the main things that's been holding them back is the lack of regulatory clarity,” Rocco said. Without regulation, it makes it harder for businesses in the market to know exactly what they can and cannot do.

Investors are also turning to bitcoin, he said, as a safe haven investment in the wake of Congress' approval of President Donald Trump's "one big beautiful bill." The bill is expected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

“These assets are betting on a weakening U.S. dollar,” Rocco said.

Additionally, bitcoin has been impacted by the growth of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, said Craig Rudes, partner at Long Island Block Chain, a technical consulting firm for blockchain technology. 

Bitcoin ETFs, which first began trading in 2024, are financial products that allow investors to invest in crypto without directly owning it or needing to create separate digital asset accounts. 

Rocco said it's likely that prices will slow down after passage of the bills, as growing crypto prices generally come about as a result anticipated favorable market conditions.

“There's been a lot of hype into this week,” he said.

The Clarity Act, which aims to demystify the roles that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission play in regulating digital currency markets, will have a major impact on crypto overall, Rocco said.

“These companies have been begging for this clarity,” he said. 

The GENIUS Act has the potential to massively grow the use and investment in stablecoins," Rocco said. "Its passage could mean a stronger U.S. Treasury if a dollar-backed digital currency takes off." 

The Senate voted in favor of the bill in June.

Rudes said the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency. As a result, he said, the bill protects investors from being mandated to use a government-run currency. 

“There shouldn't be a government entity controlling and mandating the use of a digital asset," Rudes said. 

As far as the legislation's impact on Long Island investors goes, Rudes said the passage of stablecoin regulations will usher in an age of cheaper transactions. 

“Stablecoin passing into law is going to change how we do business over the next year to two years,” he said. “No longer will we paying MasterCard and Visa these percentages on transactions.”

Hays with Americans for Financial Reform said the bills fail to protect consumers.

"They are passed as bills that provide consumer protection but what they do is create industry friendly regulatory carveouts," Hays said.

Under the proposed Clarity Act, Hays said crypto would be treated like commodities rather than securities, facing far less scrutiny and regulation. 

At the same time, he said, the GENIUS Act, in creating a framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, doesn't have the teeth to require things like insurance on deposits like a traditional bank.

“Instead of bank-like [regulations] they are bank-lite in that they give stablecoin issuers some of the same privileges of banks … but without the same obligations," Hays said.

Can you imagine a life-saving molecule whose "twin" is a deadly poison? As surprising as it may seem, this chemical reality is known as "chirality." Like a right hand and a left hand, two molecules can have the same composition, but a different shape and arrangement in space. And this difference can change everything. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon is crucial to drug design. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the University of Pisa, has developed a new family of remarkably stable chiral molecules. This work opens up new prospects for the design of geometry-controlled drugs. It is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

A molecule, or any object, is said to be chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any combination of rotations, translations and geometric changes. This is similar to our two hands, which appear identical but cannot be superimposed, whether viewed from the back or the palm. This universal molecular asymmetry requires chemists to design chiral molecules capable of interacting precisely with living systems.

Within a molecule, chirality often arises from the presence of one or more asymmetry centers, known as stereogenic centers. These are often made up of a central carbon atom, itself linked to four different groups or chains of atoms, usually carbon as well. The group led by Jérôme Lacour, Full Professor in the Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UNIGE Faculty of Science, has created a new type of stereogenic center. This time, the central carbon atom is not surrounded by carbon chains, but only by oxygen and nitrogen atoms. A first in the field of chemistry.

''Molecules with this new type of stereogenic center had never before been isolated in a stable form. Their synthesis and characterization mark a major conceptual and experimental breakthrough,'' explains Jérôme Lacour.

Outstanding stability

The stability of chiral molecules is a particularly important parameter. Mirror molecule pairs are structurally very close, and in many cases spontaneous switching from one to the other is possible, for example under the effect of temperature. As if a left hand were suddenly transformed into a right hand. In this way, we could switch from a drug to an inactive or even toxic molecule! The new molecular structures developed by the UNIGE team feature exceptional chiral stability, meaning that the switch from one molecule to its mirror sister is particularly unlikely.

Olivier Viudes, PhD student and first author of the study explains: "Using dynamic chromatography techniques and quantum chemistry calculations, we have shown that, for the first molecule developed, it would take 84,000 years at room temperature for half a sample to transform into its mirror molecule." For a drug, such stability guarantees safe storage, without the need for specific conditions. For the second molecule, this time has been estimated at 227 days at 25°C.

The new stereogenic centers developed by the Geneva team should enable the design of stable, controlled, three-dimensional chiral molecules. These structures open up new possibilities for drug design and the creation of new materials. ''These novel stereogenic centers offer a new way of organizing molecular space. They open up a whole new degree of freedom and imagination in chemical synthesis,'' concludes Gennaro Pescitelli, professor at the University of Pisa and co-principal investigator of the article.

Pneumonic Plague Infections in Modern Times Show the Black Death Isn't Dead

A person in Arizona recently died of pneumonic plague—a rare and severe form of the disease. An expert explains how the bacteria that spurred the Black Death centuries ago continues to claim lives

By Lauren J. Young edited by Dean Visser

Yersinia pestis.

Plague is often associated with Medieval history and the centuries-old Black Death epidemic, but a recent death in northern Arizona is a troublesome reminder of the flea-borne disease's lingering hold in parts of the world, including the U.S. Local health officials in Arizona's Coconino County, which includes the city of Flagstaff, confirmed late last week that a person there had died of pneumonic plague—a severe lung infection caused by Yersinia pestis, the bacterium behind the illness.

Human infections and fatalities from plague are relatively rare in the U.S.; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seven human cases are reported annually on average. Prior to the Arizona case, the most recent death was reported in 2021. Y. pestis arrived in port cities in the U.S. around 1900 and has since become endemic to rats and other rodents in western U.S. states including New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon and Nevada.

“From a public health standpoint in the U.S., it's a scary thing that it's plague, and it's tragic that that this was a fatal case, but people need to remember that it's extremely rare,” says David Wagner, executive director of the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University, who has studied plague for more than 25 years. “Not to be flippant, but it's more important that you put your seat belt on going to the grocery store than it is to worry about plague in the western U.S.”

Scientific American spoke with Wagner about plague's signs and symptoms, and its persistence across time.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

How do people get sick with plague?

Plague is caused by the bacterium Y. pestis and is really a disease of rodents and their fleas. You have an infected rodent; a flea feeds on the blood of that rodent, and it picks up some Y. pestis. Then when the flea feeds on another rodent, it can pass along the Y. pestis. It's constantly cycling back and forth between rodents and fleas in nature; that's how it's been maintained for thousands of years in the environment around the world.

What's the difference between bubonic and pneumonic plague?

People call it the Black Death; they call it bubonic plague; they call it pneumonic plague—it's all the same disease, just different clinical manifestations. What stands apart [with the recent case is] that it's pneumonic plague. That's kind of rare, especially in the U.S.

Pretty much all human cases, with a few exceptions, are acquired from the environment—from the bite of an infected flea. If there isn't a rodent host for that flea to feed on, it will look for other mammals to feed on. And if humans happen to be in proximity, it will feed on humans and can transmit Y. pestis.

If the immune system doesn't stop Y. pestis at the source of the flea bite, it will migrate through your lymphatic system to your closest major lymph node. So let's say I was bit on my wrist; then the bacteria would go to that lymph node in my underarm and start to reproduce there. And that mass swelling, that swollen lymph node, is called a bubo—that's why it's called bubonic plague. These days, it's a dead end because there's not flea-borne transmission from one human to another. It just stops there with the treatment or death of that individual.

Left untreated, though, bubonic plague can get down into your lungs via the bloodstream. That's called secondary pneumonic plague. Those individuals, then, via cough or direct contact, can spread plague person-to-person, and that's called primary pneumonic plague.

What people might not know is that plague has been endemic throughout the western U.S. in rodent populations for more than 100 years.

Someone could also get pneumonic plague from an animal—for example, if they were handling an infected animal and that animal coughed. Sometimes hunters in Central Asia will kill [infected] ground squirrels, and when they're skinning them can inhale particles. People also talk about septicemic plague, and that means it's gotten into your bloodstream, and that typically also arises from bubonic plague. You could also get [septicemic plague] directly if you had cuts on your hands and were handling rodents without gloves.

Can pets get infected or transmit plague to humans?

Pets, especially free-roaming ones, may come into contact with dead rodents that have died of plague. Fleas can hop onto pets, which then bring them into the home. This is pretty rare because there are so few [human] cases in the U.S., but that is something we think about.

Flea and tick collars are a good idea. If animals do get sick, most of the evidence shows that dogs fight off the infection and can create antibodies against Y. pestis. Cats are more susceptible and can quickly become sick and actually can progress to pneumonic plague. It's super, super rare, but that's a possible way for humans to be exposed to pneumonic plague.

What are the symptoms and treatment?

With bubonic plague, typically people develop a fever, headache, chills and fatigue, and then they'll get those swollen lymph nodes called buboes. It typically takes a few days to manifest because it sort of starts off in stealthy mode inside the body to try and avoid the immune system.

Plague is easily treated with many different types of antibiotics, as long as it's caught in time. If untreated, bubonic plague mortality rates may be somewhere between 30 to 60 percent, depending on the situation. Pneumonic plague, left untreated, is almost always fatal. So diagnostics become really important. The challenge is that many physicians in the U.S. have never seen plague. The symptoms are a bit common to other things, so rapid testing in the lab can help.

Where is plague typically found in the U.S. and around the world?

What people might not know is that plague has been endemic throughout the western U.S. in rodent populations for more than 100 years. It just so happened that a lot of the rodent host species in Central Asia, where it evolved, were quite similar to some of the ground squirrels that we have here in the U.S. It was first reported in native ground squirrels in California in 1908 and was in human populations before then. And then it spread really rapidly to the east and just sort of stopped at the western edge of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. It's a bit of a mystery why; the rodent diversity and climate changes quite a bit in [that region].

I'm also currently working on plague with colleagues in Madagascar, which has more human plague cases than any other country—around 75 percent of the global [case] total. It has hundreds to thousands of cases every year, with quite a few deaths.

How has it persisted over the years?

We don't have a good handle on which rodents are actually maintaining it in the U.S. So we've been going out and collecting plague-infected fleas from prairie dogs for more than 25 years because it's our window into plague activity. Prairie dogs are ground squirrels that live in dense colonies, so they're very conspicuous. If the prairie dogs die off, we go out and collect fleas from their burrows. We take a piece of white flannel, breathe on it to bait it with carbon dioxide, and then put it down the burrows. The fleas will hop on, and then we take them back to our laboratory and freeze them to kill them. Then we can study the Y. pestis DNA directly from those fleas. We're very careful when we do this, and we talk with our physicians here at Northern Arizona University. Every year we review the symptoms and they give us a prescription for antibiotics. Then we do what we call fever watch, where we take our temperature before we go out.

The prairie dogs can't be maintaining it because they're just so susceptible—it'll just wipe out a whole colony when it gets in. And so there's other rodents out there maintaining plague, but it's still a bit of a mystery in the western U.S.

How has it become less dangerous?

There were three great historical plague pandemics, and it's estimated that maybe 250 million people died [total]. But we don't have those large pandemics anymore because we have hygiene, which controls rat populations in cities—and then, most importantly, we have antibiotics.

More than 57 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, a figure expected to double every 20 years. Despite this growing burden, there are currently no cures, and treatment options remain limited due to disease heterogeneity, prolonged preclinical and prodromal phases, poor understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic challenges. Identifying novel biomarkers is crucial for improving early detection, prognosis, staging and subtyping of these conditions. High-dimensional molecular studies in biofluids (‘omics') offer promise for scalable biomarker discovery, but challenges in assembling large, diverse datasets hinder progress. To address this, the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC)—a public–private partnership—established one of the world's largest harmonized proteomic datasets. It includes approximately 250 million unique protein measurements from multiple platforms from more than 35,000 biofluid samples (plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid) contributed by 23 partners, alongside associated clinical data spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This dataset is accessible to GNPC members via the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative's AD Workbench, a secure cloud-based environment, and will be available to the wider research community on 15 July 2025. Here we present summary analyses of the plasma proteome revealing disease-specific differential protein abundance and transdiagnostic proteomic signatures of clinical severity. Furthermore, we describe a robust plasma proteomic signature of APOE ε4 carriership, reproducible across AD, PD, FTD and ALS, as well as distinct patterns of organ aging across these conditions. This work demonstrates the power of international collaboration, data sharing and open science to accelerate discovery in neurodegeneration research.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other related conditions, affect more than 57 million people worldwide1. Until recently, treatment options were limited to managing symptoms, but approvals for disease-modifying drugs for AD and genetic forms of ALS point to considerable progress2,3. Eventually, it may be possible to provide patients with targeted treatments, possibly in combination, that can prevent, slow, stop or reverse the progression of their disease4,5,6. However, several major obstacles have delayed the realization of this vision. First, many neurodegenerative conditions have an extended preclinical or prodromal period where diagnosis using available symptom-based assessments is either not possible or extremely difficult due to subtle manifestations that are not detectable by current clinical tools. Second, heterogeneity in the concordance between molecular pathology and clinical syndrome as well as common co-occurrence of multiple pathologies (‘co-pathology') contribute to misdiagnosis in clinical settings. Third, additional variability exists in the rate and pattern of symptom progression within conditions, impeding efforts to accurately prognosticate disease course. These diagnostic and prognostic challenges ultimately hinder the efficacy of clinical trials and make successful treatment of patients with any approved disease-modifying therapy challenging.

Biomarkers have the potential to resolve some of these obstacles by enabling earlier diagnosis linked to pathological processes, providing methods to subtype diseases, predicting outcomes and ultimately guiding effective intervention7,8. They may also improve clinical trial design through precision recruitment and serve as pharmacodynamic or surrogate endpoints in experimental medicine. Recognizing this potential, the field has seen rapid advances in imaging and fluid biomarker research, leading to their growing incorporation into clinical trials and regulatory frameworks. Fluid biomarkers, in particular, offer a real-time window into brain pathology and may help bridge the longstanding disconnect between neuropathology and clinical symptoms in living patients. Reflecting this progress, clinical guidelines have begun to integrate fluid biomarkers into routine diagnostic workflows9. To date, fluid biomarker development has been most successful for AD, where markers of amyloid and tau pathology are now widely used. However, there remains an urgent need for reliable biomarkers of other neurodegenerative pathologies, including α-synuclein, TDP-43 and non-AD tauopathies. In addition, biomarkers that reflect non-specific but disease-relevant biological processes, such as neuroinflammation, metabolic dysregulation and vascular dysfunction, are essential to fully characterize the pathophysiological and molecular landscape of neurodegeneration.

The accelerating development of high-throughput molecular profiling technologies, combined with increasingly powerful computational tools applied to large, deeply phenotyped cohorts, is transforming the landscape of biomarker discovery10. Although multi-omics approaches, such as integration of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, contribute to rich data-driven biomarker discovery, proteomics is uniquely positioned to impact both diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease. This is due to several key factors: (1) many clinically established biomarkers are protein based; (2) high-dimensional proteomic platforms such as SomaScan, Olink and mass spectrometry now offer sufficient depth to capture a sizable portion of the circulating proteome; and (3) protein-level changes often capture biological processes proximal to neurodegeneration, providing functional insights that are directly relevant to disease pathogenesis. Proteomic profiles derived from peripheral biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) not only hold promise for identifying biomarkers of disease presence and progression but also offer new avenues for therapeutic target discovery.

Robust high-dimensionality omics research in heterogeneous clinical groups necessitates the use of large datasets due to poor reproducibility of findings from single-site or smaller cohorts11, but the siloing of data among a fragmented research community has been a barrier to such biomarker discovery12. Although many research institutions and initiatives have embarked on a variety of open data efforts, there is no standard model for providing researchers with easy access to data from multiple cohorts. Moreover, the use of such multicohort sources requires data aggregation and harmonization. The genetics research community has enabled huge consortia with joint data access and collaborative analysis13. In the field of neurodegenerative disease, large data-sharing efforts such as the ADNI14, AMP-AD15, PPMI16, ALS TDI's ARC17 and Answer ALS18 are examples of open datasets that facilitate cross-study collaborations. However, despite these highly productive examples of best practice, their disease-specific design limits identification of shared mechanisms of neurodegeneration and potential co-existing pathologies. In addition, most data have either never been shared or have been kept behind restrictive barriers to access12. Reasons for this include a shortage of technology solutions, a range of challenging data governance rules and privacy regimes and cultural norms and misaligned incentives among researchers, research institutions, industry and research sponsors.

The GNPC was created to systematically address these challenges to large data analysis, accelerate biomarker discovery and advance the research and development of more precise treatments for neurodegenerative disease. Our goal was to generate a large proteomics resource using available samples from established cohort studies, accompanied by a harmonized clinical dataset, and to make these data available to the scientific community in a rapid and easily accessible manner. Having reached the planned point of public data release in July 2025, the GNPC has established what it thinks is the world's largest neurodegenerative disease-focused proteomics dataset for biomarker research, with 23 partners contributing more than 35,000 analyzed biosamples and approximately 250 million unique protein measurements with matched and harmonized clinical data. Here we summarize the GNPC version 1 (V1) dataset, together with key analysis vignettes. With the associated in-depth papers in this issue19,20,21, this serves as the beginning of the explorations into this dataset and its contribution to the field of neurodegenerative disease.

Traditional ‘on premises' data science analyses have become more challenging as datasets have increased in size, with a corresponding increase in resources required for moving data from one location to another. Moreover, local analysis presents a challenge in ensuring data integrity, safety and confidentiality. The GNPC's partnership with the AD Data Initiative provided the consortium with virtual access to the cloud-resident harmonized dataset with analysis workspaces via the AD Workbench22, a secure, cloud-based environment that is able to satisfy multiple different geographical data jurisdictions (for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA))23.

For GNPC V1, we opted to use SOMAmer technology (provided by SomaLogic) as the primary proteomics platform as it was one of the broadest discovery platforms available. However, we also analyzed a subset of samples with Olink and mass spectrometry methods to allow for cross-platform comparison. In general, the GNPC's approach is agnostic to platforms and is guided primarily by coverage, reproducibility and affordability. We also think that different platforms bring complementary information as they may measure different isoforms and/or posttranslational modifications of a given protein.

Developing the GNPC's large dataset required addressing several barriers to open data and data sharing. To bring together data from several countries required navigating legal regimes with different requirements, including the GDPR (Europe), the Data Protection Act (United Kingdom) and HIPAA (United States). The GNPC's legal team worked with institutions in each jurisdiction to address specific concerns and agree on a framework for data sharing that worked across the board, including collecting the data on servers physically located in Western Europe.

The first version of the harmonized data was made available to consortium members in June 2024. Analysis of the harmonized dataset is organized in four workstreams to allow members of the consortium to collaborate on areas of related interest: longitudinal profiling, cross-sectional profiling, proteogenomics and prediction modeling. Here we present the first set of analyses of the GNPC dataset, including the overarching summary analyses and, in accompanying papers, the work conducted in the GNPC workstreams during the first year of data availability.

The GNPC V1 harmonized dataset is focused on neurodegenerative diseases and, more specifically, on AD, PD, ALS, FTD and aging among 18,645 participants, drawn from 23 individual cohorts across a total of 31,083 unique peripheral plasma, serum and CSF samples, culminating in 35,056 unique proteomic assays and approximately 250 million individual protein measurements (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Most of the proteomics characterization comes from the SOMAmer-based capture array (SomaScan version 4.1, version 4 and version 3 platforms), measuring approximately 7,000 (n = 26,458), 5,000 (n = 4,528) or 1,300 (n = 95) unique aptamers per biosample, respectively. Additionally, 1,975 of the plasma samples characterized on the version 4.1 SomaScan platform had tandem mass tag mass spectrometry performed. The harmonized dataset additionally includes 40 clinical features, including demographic data, vital signs data and clinical features collected with each blood or CSF draw (Supplementary Table 3). These aggregated and harmonized data demonstrated their value to the consortium immediately, as they served to rapidly confirm signals originally identified in smaller datasets across the entirety of the GNPC V1 dataset, thereby serving as an ‘instant validation' resource24,25.

To evaluate the structure and comparability of the blood-based proteomics data, we conducted a principal component analysis on plasma and serum samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). Serum samples clustered distinctly from plasma, reflecting a clear matrix effect. Among plasma samples, a modest offset was observed between the 5K and 7K SomaScan platforms, whereas EDTA and citrate plasma samples appeared largely similar. All three vignettes described below focused exclusively on plasma proteomic data, and, where relevant, platform-related differences between 5K and 7K assays were addressed using scaling or predictive modeling approaches.

To highlight the breadth and utility of the GNPC V1 resource, we present three illustrative vignettes that showcase how this harmonized dataset can be applied to address key questions in neurodegenerative disease and aging research: (1) disease-specific differential abundance profiling, (2) biological aging across organ systems and (3) protein markers of genetic risk as exemplified by the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. As summarized below and described in more detail in the accompanying papers in this issue19,20,21, these vignettes reflect the analytical depth enabled by the GNPC and are intended to catalyze further exploration by the broader research community upon public data release.

We examined the plasma proteome as measured using the SomaLogic 7K platform, among people with AD, PD, FTD and ALS (referred to hereafter as ‘Patients', n = 3,002), and separately among people with no neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and cognitively normal test screenings (referred to hereafter as ‘Controls', n = 5,879) (see Vignette 1 methods for sample selection criteria). First, we sought to identify proteins differentially abundant in the plasma of patients with different neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive effects—namely, AD, PD, FTD and ALS. Leveraging the breadth of cohorts included in the GNPC, we first performed cohort-stratified analyses to internally validate the most robust protein changes, focusing on those consistently altered across multiple study cohorts. Cohort-stratified results were subsequently combined using a meta-analysis for AD (Fig. 1a), PD (Fig. 1b), FTD (Fig. 1c) and ALS (Fig. 1d).

a–d, Meta-analytic differential abundance analysis showing changes in relative protein expression of AD (a), PD (b), FTD (c) and ALS (d) compared to Controls. Each dot represents a protein. The x axis shows the direction and effect size of protein changes relative to Controls, from linear regression models including age and sex as covariates; the y axis shows the –log10 FDR-adjusted P value. P values from two-sided tests and after adjustment from FDR are reported. The parallel line at the bottom of each plot shows which proteins are significant after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. The line above shows proteins further surviving Bonferroni correction. Dots are colored based on the number of cohorts where the protein was found to be independently significant after (within-cohort) FDR correction and changed in the same direction relative to Controls (that is, increased or decreased compared to Controls). e–h, Significant proteins from the differential abundance analyses were fed into Reactome enrichment analysis for AD (e), PD (f), FTD (g) and ALS (h), using unique SomaScan 7K proteins as background. Enriched Reactome pathway terms for each condition are visualized as dot plots, with dot size corresponding to the number of differentially abundant proteins assigned to a given pathway (one-sided Fisherʼs test with FDR adjustments). Full Reactome enrichment summary statistics are reported in Supplementary Table 6.

In AD (n = 1,966), 27 proteins from AD Patients robustly emerged as being significantly elevated compared to Controls across at least six of the 10 different cohorts, including ACHE, SPC25, LRRN1 and CTF1. Additionally, GDF2 and APOB also showed high meta-analytic effect sizes and were independently significant in five and four separate cohorts, respectively (Fig. 1a). In contrast, 130 proteins were consistently lower in AD plasma across at least six cohorts, including VAT1, GPD1, ARPC2 and PA2G4. Furthermore, we observed significant decreases in RPS12, NPTXR and NT5C across five cohorts. These top hits highlight both expected and underexplored targets consistently altered in AD plasma across cohorts, including those with established ties to lipid metabolism (APOB and GPD1), cholinergic signaling and/or treatment response (ACHE and VAT1) and synaptic integrity (NPTXR), as well as novel targets linked to cytoskeletal regulation (ARPC2) and RNA metabolism (PA2G4 and RPS12). Follow-up analysis (see Vignette 3) also indicated that elevation of some targets, such as SPC25, LRRN1 and CTF1, reflected underlying APOE ε4 genotype effects rather than AD diagnosis per se. Reactome pathway analyses (n = 2,640, Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) revealed enrichment for terms related to sugar metabolism (‘glucose metabolism' and ‘glycolysis') and protein prenylation (‘RAB geranylgeranyltransferase'), reinforcing links to bioenergetics and vesicle trafficking (Fig. 1e).

In PD (n = 607), 40 proteins were significantly elevated across at least three of seven different cohorts, including SUMF1, PRR15, AARDC3 and RDH16, which were elevated in at least four cohorts (Fig. 1b). Additional proteins such as PSMC5, DDX1 and VSIR exhibited strong effect sizes and replicated in two cohorts. In contrast, 15 proteins were significantly lower in PD plasma across at least three cohorts, including CLEC3B, GPD1 and SEMA4G. Meta-analytic effect sizes were very high for PRSS8, BAGE3, NPS, PRL and HEXB, all of which decreased in PD but were less reproducible across contributing cohorts, suggesting cohort-specific factors driving depleted abundance of these targets. These candidate PD-associated proteins include targets associated with proteostatic (SUMF1, HEXB and PSMC5), immune (VSIR and CLEC3B) and axonal guidance (SEMA4G) pathways, possibly reflecting both peripheral and brain-related pathophysiology. Similar to in AD, Reactome pathway analyses (n = 2,251, Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) revealed enrichment for terms related to Ras superfamily/small GTPases and vesicle trafficking (‘vesicle-mediated transport' and ‘signaling by RHO GTPases'), highlighting a plasma proteome pathway overlap between AD and PD (Fig. 1f).

Although FTD clinical syndromes are less common than AD or PD and have greater clinical and neuropathological diversity, nine targets exhibited decreased abundance in FTD plasma (n = 175) across multiple cohorts after Bonferroni correction (Fig. 1c). Strongly downregulated hits included NPTXR, APLP1 and HS6ST3, which converge on processes critical for synaptic maintenance and neuronal support. Eleven proteins were significantly elevated in FTD plasma with a conventional false discovery rate (FDR) correction but did not survive Bonferroni correction. Despite limited power, Reactome pathway analyses (n = 71, FDR < 0.05) revealed two significantly enriched terms, ‘posttranslational protein phosphorylation' and ‘regulation of insulin-like growth factor transport and uptake by IGFBPs', highlighting conserved peripheral signatures of neurodegeneration even amid the clinical and pathological heterogeneity of FTD (Fig. 1g).

In ALS (n = 254), we analyzed plasma proteomic profiles from a single contributing cohort with Patients and Controls (Fig. 1d). After FDR correction, 44 targets exhibited significantly increased abundance in ALS, including a host of proteins related to skeletal muscle structure and function (PDLIM3, MYOM2, MYLPF and TNNI2). Thirty-eight targets exhibited significantly decreased abundance in ALS, including two aptamers targeting ART3, an ADP-ribosyltransferase enriched in skeletal muscle, as well as additional proteins linked to growth factor signaling and/or extracellular matrix composition (ANTXR2, CRTAC1 and RGMA). Reactome pathway analyses (n = 82, FDR < 0.05) confirmed this strong biological enrichment for skeletal muscle-related processes (‘muscle contraction' and ‘collagen chain trimerization') (Fig. 1h), underscoring a clear peripheral proteomic footprint of ALS consistent with its primary motor system pathology.

After identifying disease-related differential abundance patterns, we combined data across AD, PD and FTD to identify a global signature of dementia severity. Specifically, a 256-protein clinical impairment signature was derived using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based prediction of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global scores, which was subsequently evaluated in a held-out test set (2,047 records; 30% of the dataset). Signature values correlated with CDR global scores (train: Pearsonʼs r = 0.68; test: r = 0.58) in a stepwise fashion, increasing at each level of clinical severity (Fig. 1i; see Supplementary Table 7 for individual-level scores). To demonstrate concordance with an orthogonal clinical outcome, we observed that higher signature values were also associated with lower cognitive test scores (standardized Montreal Cognitive Assessment/Mini-Mental State Examination (MoCA/MMSE); r = −0.47), consistent with expected inverse correlations between cognition and CDR. In disease-stratified analysis combined across training and test sets, the multivariate protein signature was reliably elevated with greater clinical severity in AD (r = 0.55), FTD (r = 0.85) and PD (r = 0.70), supporting its relevance as a transdiagnostic marker of clinical severity (Fig. 1j). Top proteins with high feature importance in the clinical impairment signature (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 8) again highlighted ACHE and NPTXR as well as additional targets linked to neuroplasticity (EPHA4 and CNTFR) and immune activation (MSMP and KLK3), underscoring their potential for transdiagnostic dementia staging.

One advantage of plasma proteomics is the ability to simultaneously query the health of distinct organ systems. We applied previously validated plasma proteomic organ aging models26 to assess accelerated organ-specific aging across multiple Patient and Control data in the GNPC. Predicted organ ages showed moderate to strong correlations with chronological age (r range, 0.36–0.92; Fig. 2a), confirming model performance in the GNPC cohort26. Figure 2b shows the association between organ age gaps, which capture person-specific differences between estimated organ age and actual age, and AD, FTD and PD, respectively. Elevated cognition-enriched brain age gaps, reflecting the subset of brain-specific proteins that previously enhanced model age gap prediction of cognitive impairment, were associated with higher odds of AD (odds ratio = 1.33 per 1-s.d. age gap increase (95% confidence interval: 1.25–1.41)) and FTD (odds ratio = 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.06–1.48)). Non-cognition-enriched brain age gap was weakly associated with AD risk (odds ratio = 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.14)) but not other conditions. Beyond brain, we observed contributions of artery (odds ratio = 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.11–1.25)), liver (odds ratio = 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.17)) and intestine aging to AD (odds ratio range, 1.12–1.18) as well as a unique link between muscle aging and PD (odds ratio = 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.19)). These findings extend previous work by demonstrating shared and distinct patterns of blood-detectable accelerated organ aging across AD, FTD and PD, underscoring connections between systemic health and neurodegenerative disease that may be related as a cause, correlate or consequence.

Black dashed line indicates the LOWESS regression estimate of the population mean. Pearsonʼs correlation coefficient r is reported for each clock. b, Body plots showing associations of standardized organ age gaps with neurodegenerative disease based on binary logistic regression models. P values are from two-sided tests. Red dots indicate positive associations (higher age gap with disease); blue dots indicate negative associations (lower age gap with disease). Bold labels highlight organ ages associated with organ age gap with P < 0.05 after FDR correction. The body plots were created in BioRender: Oh, H. (2025): https://BioRender.com/afoqtwz.

Using a combination of machine learning and biological enrichment approaches, we sought to isolate the molecular signatures of APOE ε4, the main genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, independent of AD and other conditions. Several proteins, including SPC25, LRRN1, S100A13 and NEFL, were strongly associated with APOE ε4 versus other alleles (Fig. 3a), paralleling prior observations for some of these targets in serum27. Some proteins, such as SPC25 and LRRN1, showed no difference between AD and Controls but exhibited dose-dependent associations with APOE ε4 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that previously identified links to AD from Vignette 1's differential abundance analysis were driven by APOE ε4 enrichment in AD cases. Conversely, well-known AD-associated neuromodulatory proteins such as NPTXR and GDF2 were robustly associated with AD diagnosis, irrespective of APOE ε4 allelic dose (Fig. 3c).

a, Volcano plot shows the protein association profile of APOE ε4 after adjusting for AD dementia diagnosis, with red representing significant associations (after FDR correction). At the y axis, the −log10(FDR-adjusted P values) > 300 were set to 300 for better visualization. This was done for S100A13, TBCA, NEFL, LRRN1 and SPC25. b,c, Box plots show plasma protein level changes of the proteins with the strongest APOE ε4 associations (b) and for APOE ε4-associated proteins strongly tied to AD dementia diagnosis (c). For b and c, the y axis represents residual protein levels after adjusting for age, sex, mean protein level and contribution site. The center line of each box indicates the median, with lower and upper edges representing the 25th and 75th percentiles. Whiskers extend to the most extreme values within 1.5 times the interquartile range; data points beyond this range were excluded as outliers. The x axis represents AD diagnosis. The color indicates APOE ε4 carrier status; ‘−/−' indicates APOE ε4 non-carriers; ‘±' indicates ε3/ε4; and ‘+/+' indicates ε4/ε4. Welch's t-test was used to compare residual protein levels between groups. Two-sided P values are reported. ****P < 0.0001 and *P < 0.05. P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, as only prespecified group contrasts are shown. Results marked with **** remain significant (pFDR < 0.0001) even after adjustment for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini–Hochberg method, whereas those marked with * do not. d, Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) showing the performance of a machine learning model using only five proteins to predict APOE ε4 status across different diagnostic groups, in a held-out sample. e, Protein interaction network including four of those five proteins (red). f, Neural cell type expression of RNA transcripts encoding the five APOE ε4-predictive proteins.

Limma t-statistic is shown for both contrasts; only proteins associated with both APOE ε4 and AD (adjusted P < 0.05 for both analyses) with the same direction of effect are visualized. For visibility purposes, t-statistic values higher than 10 were capped. PDD, Parkinsonʼs disease dementia; pFDR, FDR-corrected P value.

Notably, the effects of APOE ε4 genotype on the plasma proteome were so robust that a machine learning model with only five proteins (SPC25, NEFL, S100A13, TBCA and LRRN1) predicted APOE ε4 carrier status in unseen patients with high accuracy, both within AD and within non-AD Patients (area under the curve (AUC) range, 0.90–0.96; Fig. 3d). Leveraging protein–protein interaction libraries and single brain cell RNA sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas28, we observed that three of these proteins (SPC25, TBCA and S100A13) were central nodes in the protein–protein interaction network (Fig. 3e) and brain cell type expression patterns (Fig. 3f)28. Ubiquitin-C, however, was found to be a key connection point across the central node proteins, suggesting potential convergence on proteostatic pathways.

Lastly, to identify potential genotype–phenotype links, we compared proteins associated with APOE ε4 in cognitively unimpaired individuals (n = 2,817; 215 proteins) to those associated with AD in APOE ε3 homozygotes (n = 1,843; 2,150 proteins). Forty-four overlapping proteins showed consistent directionality (Fig. 3g), including targets elevated in APOE ε4 and AD. Patients involved in immunovascular signaling (MMP8), synaptic vesicle fusion (SNAP23) and lipid trafficking (APOB) pathways relevant to APOE biology and cognitive decline. This overlap highlights potential early molecular footprints of AD pathophysiology present even in asymptomatic APOE ε4 carriers and underscores the utility of contextualizing by APOE genotype when seeking AD-relevant proteomic signals. These shared proteins may reflect core features of APOE-related biology that are also prominent in AD, highlighting potential mechanisms through which APOE ε4 contributes to disease vulnerability.

The availability of high-dimensional molecular datasets has led to an increasing number of large-scale collaborative programs to share and use these data—a trend forged by the genetics community. Following these data-sharing collaborations, numerous initiatives have led the way in data sharing with the wider scientific community. We would like to highlight in particular two programs focused on neurodegeneration or proteomics. The first large-scale open data-sharing program in neurodegeneration was the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): an immensely productive public–private partnership that continues today and has spawned many followers. These include AddNeuroMed/InnoMed, an ADNI-like program in Europe that served as a pilot for the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) funding scheme that itself has generated many data-sharing and sample-sharing programs, including, for example, IMI-EMIF and IMI-EPND in neurodegeneration. In the proteomics arena, the GNPC was preceded by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBB-PPP) that generated extensive protein data on 50,000 research participants and is now planning analysis on an additional 250,000 participants, to accompany the extensive clinical, imaging and genomic data available to the scientific community. The GNPC complements both initiatives and many others in providing a disease-focused dataset, as in the ADNI, but at scale, as in the UKBB-PPP.

Notably, a key point of emphasis of the GNPC's mission is the strong intent to share this dataset with the global research community early in its life cycle. We do not present these analyses as definitive but, rather, as the pilot experiments by a subset of researchers whose datasets contributed to the construction of GNPC V1. We hope this summary paper and more in-depth papers serve as an invitation of collaboration and/or independent analysis from the global community. Only then will we be able to maximize disease insights from GNPC V1 and its combination with other datasets to accelerate translation of insights into the next generation of diagnostics and therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.

The initial analyses presented here underscore the versatility and translational potential of the GNPC dataset. First, disease-specific differential abundance and disease-shared clinical severity analyses revealed both established and novel protein targets in plasma across AD, PD and FTD, highlighting shared and distinct biological processes such as vesicle trafficking, synaptic integrity and metabolic dysregulation. These results not only validate previously reported protein markers but also nominate new candidates for mechanistic follow-up and blood biomarker development—an urgent clinical need across diseases. Second, organ aging clocks applied to the GNPC dataset uncovered disease-specific patterns of accelerated aging across brain and peripheral organs, offering a systems-level view of proteomic aging that bridges central and systemic health. These findings extend previous work on biological aging by demonstrating that distinct conditions are associated with unique organ-specific age gaps, supporting their relevance to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, proteome-wide analysis of the APOE genotype revealed a robust and disease-independent APOE ε4 signature, with potential mechanistic relevance to proteostasis and lipid transport. These vignettes, each explored further in companion publications19,20,21, illustrate the range of insights made possible by GNPC V1 and set the stage for future hypothesis-driven and exploratory research by the broader scientific community, with the potential to better support trial design, monitoring and subtyping of clinical patients.

These data, as well as these vignette analyses and those in the accompanying papers, suggest that very large protein datasets have potential to add value to drug discovery. Hitherto, the value of genetic data has been increasingly recognized in supporting effective drug discovery. Notably, targets with genetic support are more likely to progress through the drug discovery pipeline29 with probability of success recently being calculated to be 2.6 times greater than in targets lacking genetic support, even for genes with small effect sizes30. In contrast to the inherited traits represented by genetic variants, proteomics represents biological states. Although genetic factors are intrinsically causal in their relationship with disease, a proteomic association with disease might be consequential of the disease, a factor associated with disease (including response to a therapeutic) or reflect a causal process. Although these observations might suggest a role for proteomics more in supporting drug discovery through biomarker discovery rather than for target identification, the vignettes reported here and in the accompanying papers illustrate the potential for more direct drug target identification/validation. For example, in Vignette 1, the proteomic profiles identified include strong support for synaptic dysfunction with proteins identified that are already clearly part of a mechanism targeted for neurodegeneration drug discovery, such as NPTXR31, whereas, in Vignette 3, proteins are identified that are very strongly associated with APOE status and with disease state. These proteins will surely now be considered as possible targets for drug discovery, especially considering that the APOE genotype is a striking example of a very strong genetic risk factor that has not been the source of equally strong drug discovery programs. The GNPC data also support target validation, an important component of target identification in driving drug discovery. Preclinical models might be used to generate signatures of targets or interventions, and, using GNPC data, these signatures now can be used to predict outcomes. In reverse, signatures or candidate protein targets identified in the GNPC could be validated in such preclinical models. Whether in conjunction with genetic data or with preclinical models, the proteomics data now being made available are likely to become a strong additional component of effective target identification and validation. As additional datasets similar to the GNPC and UKBB-PPP become available, it is possible that proteomics will become as important an element of drug discovery as genetics is today.

Despite the evident success in establishing a substantial dataset, the GNPC has some limitations. These include the relative lack of diversity, reflecting much of past observational bioresources where most research participants have been individuals of European ancestry living in the Global North. The dataset would also be enhanced with other proteomics platforms, including complementary molecular biomarker data including genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics as well as imaging and clinical data and with other disease types related to neurodegeneration. Data harmonization challenges in a post hoc meta-analysis such as the GNPC include site differences in sample processing, clinical methodologies for diagnoses and patient demographics. For example, incomplete medication information limited the ability to identify and separate definitive drug-induced changes to the proteome from disease-relevant changes and/or to correlate proteomic signatures comprehensively with amyloid and synuclein biomarkers. However, despite the cross-site heterogeneity, we were nonetheless able to identify clear and novel signals in the plasma proteome as presented in the vignettes.

The GNPC has been built to accommodate growth and aims to increase diversity in terms of patients and measurements over time. As a next step, the GNPC is poised to incorporate additional cohorts, samples and data platforms in a V2 dataset and will seek to rectify some of these limitations as we build out the collaboration. The flexibility of the platform allows for secure, iterative data releases to adapt to new discoveries made in the field. The GNPC's aspiration is to facilitate neurodegenerative disease research and development, driving advances toward better outcomes for people with neurodegenerative diseases through precision, combination therapy optimized for a patient's disease subtypes.

Proteomic profiling within the GNPC was primarily performed using the SomaScan platform (SomaLogic). Biofluid specimens were independently shipped by each contributing cohort to SomaLogic, with coordination support provided by Gates Ventures. The SomaScan platform uses slow off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers) to quantify thousands of proteins in human biofluids, including plasma, serum and CSF. Samples were analyzed within each contributing cohort using versions 3 (~1,300 targets), 4 (~5,000 targets) or 4.1 (~7,000 targets) of the SomaScan assay.

All participating cohorts confirmed that all contributed clinical and generated biosample data were in compliance with the individual patient consents prior to contributing data to the GNPC. Proteomic data from each contributing cohort were processed separately, following SomaLogic's standardized adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood (ANML) pipeline for hybridization normalization, signal calibration and quality control. These procedures adjust for systematic variation using internal reference standards and buffer controls included on each assay plate. Between-sample normalization was performed using median signal intensities and adaptive procedures to reduce batch and run-to-run variation. Samples with signal intensities that substantially deviated from expected ranges are flagged by SomaLogic for quality concerns but were not removed from the dataset. After cohort-level processing and normalization, datasets were combined to form the harmonized GNPC V1 dataset.

At the time of release, we have included 53 clinical variables across all datasets and will continue to increase this number toward a target of over 150 harmonizable variables in the next version of the harmonized dataset. The clinical variables included in this first release of data include demographic data, harmonized cognitive data from research assessments and comorbidity data (Supplementary Table 3).

To harmonize the clinical metadata across the 23 cohorts, we started with a minimum set of 13 required features that were requested from each cohort: age, gender, years of education, date of visit, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, medication use, comorbidities, vital signs, at least one psychiatric measure, at least one cognitive dementia or functional rating score, at least one cognitive test score and disease-specific genotype data. After initial data contribution, five key vital signs (height, weight, body mass index, resting heart rate and blood pressure) and 14 comorbidities (alcohol use, smoking/tobacco use, stroke, transient ischemic attack, traumatic brain injury, cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, angina, hyperlipidemia and hypertension) were identified as common features across at least five cohorts for harmonization. The 19 identified features were then identified, where available, from each of the cohort's data contributions. Demographic and biometric information was normalized to a common scale. Biologically impossible values were cleaned from the dataset. To handle outlier values in years of education, height, weight, body mass index, resting heart rate, blood pressure and total years smoked, an additional variable was created for each feature to indicate if a value was within 2 or 3 s.d. from the mean. Variables were aligned through a mapping schema, ensuring that equivalent tests and demographic categories were matched correctly.

Diagnosis information and control and cognitive impairment data were included, if provided. Diagnosis data for AD, PD, ALS and FTD were captured from the provided clinical data. Due to the variability in AD diagnosis methodology across the 23 cohorts, the method for diagnosis was provided. Using the provided diagnosis data from each site and CDR test scores, a harmonized Clinical Diagnosis variable was created categorizing each participant into one of four categories: Cognitively Normal (CN) (CDR = 0 or confirmed recruited control participant), MCI (CDR = 0.5), Dementia (CDR ≥ 1 or a confirmed diagnosis of AD or FTD) or Other Neurodegenerative Disease (a confirmed case of PD or ALS). For participants with no formal diagnosis information or CDR reported, cognitive test scores (MMSE or MoCA) were used to categorize an individual's cognitive impairment as Not Impaired (MMSE ≥ 24 and MoCA ≥ 17) or Impaired (MMSE < 24 and MoCA < 17) (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Datasets were merged using unique participant identifiers, followed by quality control checks to rectify inconsistencies. Finally, validation was performed by comparing results from the integrated dataset with original study findings.

Each of the three vignettes presented here was conducted by separate workstreams within the GNPC, each using distinct criteria and methodological frameworks tailored to their specific research questions. These analyses were intentionally designed to highlight the breadth of analytic approaches enabled by the GNPC dataset—from disease-specific differential abundance and transdiagnostic clinical severity modeling to biological aging clocks and genotype-based signatures. As such, they serve as illustrative examples rather than a unified analytic pipeline, showcasing the flexibility and depth of the GNPC V1 resource for diverse scientific inquiries.

For AD, PD, FTD and ALS, we used protein data from each participant's first available plasma sample, based on clinical data from the cohorts. To reduce diagnostic ambiguity, we excluded participants with conflicting or overlapping clinical labels. This included individuals labeled with both AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (n = 271) and those assigned two distinct neurodegenerative disease diagnoses (n = 90). We opted to include only individuals diagnosed with AD at the dementia stage, thus excluding those in prodromal stages. CN Control participants were included if they were explicitly labeled as Controls in their respective cohorts and/or had a CDR score of 0. We also removed participants missing age or sex data (n = 54). After all exclusions, the final dataset comprised 5,879 Controls, 1,966 patients with AD, 607 patients with PD, 175 patients with FTD and 254 patients with ALS (Supplementary Table 4).

Protein aptamer abundance levels (relative fluorescence units) were log2 transformed prior to analysis. Extreme outliers, defined as values more than 5 s.d. above or below the mean across the full dataset, were removed for each aptamer. To ensure biological relevance, only aptamers targeting human proteins were retained for analysis, resulting in a final analytic set of 7,289 unique aptamers (Supplementary Table 5).

Given the inherent heterogeneity across contributing GNPC cohorts, all differential abundance analyses were first conducted within each cohort. For each neurodegenerative disease, Patient samples were compared to Control samples using linear regression with the protein used as the dependent variable and disease diagnosis as the independent variable, with age and sex included as covariates. Only cohorts with at least five patients in each diagnostic category (AD, PD, FTD or ALS) were analyzed. In the few cohorts that lacked internal control samples (for example, Cohorts R and G for AD, Cohorts R and T for PD and Cohort S for ALS), patient data were compared to pooled Controls from the remaining cohorts. See Supplementary Table 3 for a breakdown of Controls and Patients across cohorts.

After estimating effect sizes within each cohort, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses to identify proteins with reproducible disease associations across cohorts, thereby providing internal replication of top signals. For each aptamer, a weighted average of effect sizes was calculated, taking into account the sample size of patients at each cohort, and meta-analytic Pvalues were computed using the weighted z-score method via the ‘metapro R' package. These Pvalues were then adjusted for multiple comparisons using both FDR and Bonferroni correction (separately). To further assess reproducibility, we calculated the number of cohorts in which each aptamer was significantly differentially abundant (FDR < 0.05) as well as the consistency of directionality (that is, the number of cohorts showing concordant upregulation or downregulation for a given target.)

Proteins identified in the meta-analytic differential abundance analysis were filtered into gene set enrichment analysis using the R libraries ‘ReactomePA' and ‘clusterProfiler'. Proteins were selected based on Bonferroni cutoffs where possible (AD and PD comparisons). For FTD and ALS, where statistical power was more limited, we applied a less stringent threshold of FDR < 0.05. Enrichment analysis was performed with the Reactome library against a background universe consisting of 6,404 unique human proteins measured on the SomaScan 7K platform.

Independent of diagnostic category, we also sought to identify a plasma proteomic signature of clinical severity across the GNPC disease continuum by leveraging the subset of Patients with global CDR scales (N = 6,187) and cognitive test scores (N = 5,969). To model the full spectrum of clinical severity, inclusion criteria were intentionally broadened to include all AD, PD and FTD Patients ranging from CDR = 0.5 to CDR = 3. CDR global scores were modeled based on a five-level ordinal stage from no impairment (CDR = 0) to severe impairment (CDR = 3). A proteome-wide association analysis for CDR global scores was conducted by age (linear and quadratic), sex, their interactions and smoking/alcohol status. Significant proteins (FDR < 0.05) were used to construct a multivariate protein signature via LASSO regression, with data split into 70% training and 30% test sets. Diagnosis-stratified models also tested the multivariate protein signature's ability to track cognitive severity across each clinical condition. To demonstrate robustness of prediction to orthogonal clinical measures, the CDR-derived protein signature was modeled as a predictor of cognitive performance using cross-walked, harmonized MoCA/MMSE scores (0–30 scale).

A series of recent studies has generated compelling evidence for the use of molecular ‘clocks' to estimate biological aging at the organismal and organ-specific level using plasma proteomics. Building upon this foundation, we applied validated organ age models to the GNPC dataset to evaluate disease-specific patterns of accelerated organ aging32.

This analysis was restricted to nine GNPC cohorts that included both Patients and CN Control participants, as control data were required to compute normative organ aging estimates. Diagnostic groups included individuals with AD (n = 1,973), FTD (n = 151) and PD (n = 334).

Protein levels from the SomaScan version 4.1 platform were normalized to match the version 4.0 reference using internal reference-based scaling methods, enabling consistent application of the organ aging models across assays.

Organ age estimates were computed for brain, liver, kidney, muscle, adipose, immune, lung, intestine, artery, pancreas and heart tissues, using established organ aging models that use proteins specific to each organ. Cognition-enriched brain age estimates were derived using the CognitionBrain model, which additionally limits the brain-specific proteins used for age estimation to only those that are important for the association of the model age gap with cognitive impairment, as determined by the Feature Importance for Biological Aging (FIBA) algorithm. Additionally, whole-organism (‘organismal') age estimates, using only proteins common across organs, and ‘conventional' age estimates, using all measured proteins regardless of tissue enrichment, were also calculated. The organ age gap was derived as the difference between predicted age and the cohort-specific locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression estimate for individuals with a normal cognitive clinical diagnosis (Supplementary Table 9). Associations between z-score normalized organ age gaps and diagnosis (AD, PD and FTD) were determined using logistic regression models, adjusting for age, sex and cohort.

The APOE ε4 allele is the leading genetic risk factor of late-onset AD, yet its high frequency in patients with AD complicates efforts to disentangle APOE from AD-related proteomic changes. To address this, we implemented a stepwise analytic framework to isolate proteomic signatures linked to APOE ε4 carriership, irrespective of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.

Participants were selected from GNPC cohorts based on strict diagnostic and cognitive performance criteria to ensure well-defined AD and Control groups. We first identified individuals labeled with an AD dementia diagnosis or recruited as Controls. Participants with multiple neurodegenerative disease diagnoses were excluded. Patients with AD dementia were required to have either MMSE < 24 or MoCA <17 and CDR ≥ 1, to ensure alignment with established diagnostic thresholds for dementia. CN participants did not meet criteria for any clinical diagnosis (for example, AD, MCI, FTD, ALS and PD) and had CDR = 0 and, at a minimum, cognitive test scores above a dementia threshold (MMSE ≥ 24 and/or MoCA ≥ 17) (Supplementary Table 10). To minimize confounding from opposing genotype effects, APOE ε2/ε4 heterozygotes were excluded from the analysis.

After applying the above criteria, a total of 3,934 participants were identified for further analysis. Among them, n = 2,357 were APOE ε4 non-carriers (ε4−) and n = 1,577 were APOE ε4 carriers (ε4+, either ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4). At baseline, 1,438 individuals were diagnosed with AD, and the remaining 2,496 were non-impaired (CN) Controls.

Consistent with differential abundance analyses (see Vignette 1 methods), log2-transformed aptamer values that deviated more than 5 s.d. from the mean were defined as outliers and excluded. Proteins associated with APOE ε4 carriers (carrier versus non-carrier) were identified using linear regression models, adjusting for AD dementia diagnosis (CN versus AD dementia diagnosis), age, sex, contributing cohort code and mean overall protein level (Supplementary Table 11). Multiple testing correction was performed using FDR adjustment (Benjamini–Hochberg method, α = 0.05). Residualized protein values were used for visualization. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test in the ‘ggpubr' R package (version 0.6.0) was used to test and mark the changes in protein residuals in the APOE ε4 carrier group and the AD dementia diagnosis group (Supplementary Table 12)33.

To identify a disease-agnostic proteomic signature of APOE ε4 allele status, a machine learning classification model was developed. Proteomic data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets, with standardization performed independently within each set. A classification and regression trees (CART) approach was applied to the data using cross-validation and fine tuning. All final metrics reported were derived from application of the model to the left-out testing dataset.

Model performance was stratified by CN and AD as well as FTD, PD and Parkinsonʼs disease dementia. First-order functional networks were built from proteins of interest identified by the CART model. In addition, brain cell subtype-specific enrichment analysis was performed using single-nuclei brain RNA sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas.

To explore proteins influenced independently by APOE ε4 carriership and AD diagnosis, two additional comparisons were performed. First, proteins associated with APOE ε4 in cognitively unimpaired individuals were identified. Second, proteins associated with AD compared to Controls were identified specifically in APOE ε3 homozygote AD patients. Analyses were performed using limma (limma_3.62.2) and adjusted for sex, age at visit and contributor code. Multiple testing correction was performed using FDR adjustment (Benjamini–Hochberg method, α = 0.05).

The APOE ε4 genetic variant is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is increasingly being implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases. Using the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium SomaScan dataset covering 1,346 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 9,924 plasma samples, we used machine learning-based proteome profiling to identify an APOE ε4 proteomic signature shared across individuals with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and nonimpaired controls. This signature was enriched in pro-inflammatory immune and infection pathways as well as immune cells, including monocytes, T cells and natural killer cells. Analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex proteome for 262 donors from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD UPenn Proteomics Study revealed a consistent APOE ε4 phenotype, independent of neurodegenerative pathology, including amyloid-β tau and gliosis for all diseases, as well as TDP-43 in ALS and FTD cases, and α-synuclein in PD and PDD cases. While systemic proteomic changes were consistent across APOE ε4 carriers, their relationship with clinical and lifestyle factors, such as hypertension and smoking, varied by disease. These findings suggest APOE ε4 confers a systemic biological vulnerability that is necessary but not sufficient for neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need to consider gene–environment interactions. Overall, our study reveals a conserved APOE ε4-associated pro-inflammatory immune signature persistent across the brain, CSF and plasma irrespective of neurodegenerative disease, highlighting a fundamental, disease-independent biological vulnerability to neurodegeneration. This work reframes APOE ε4 as a pleiotropic immune modulator rather than an AD-specific risk gene, providing a foundation for precision biomarker development and early intervention strategies across neurodegenerative diseases.

The ε4 variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) gene is well-established as the largest genetic risk factor of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. Growing evidence, however, indicates that APOE ε4 carriage may also have a role in other age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have linked APOE ε4 to increased risk and lower age of onset of frontotemporal dementia (FTD)2,3,4,5,6, Parkinson's disease (PD)5,7,8 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)9,10. APOE ε4 is also linked to a faster rate of cognitive decline and poor cognition in PD, increasing the risk of PD dementia (PDD)11,12,13,14,15,16. Despite the deleterious impact of APOE ε4, little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this effect and if, or how, it changes across the different neurodegenerative diseases. We recently showed that APOE ε4 carriers, irrespective of cognitive status in AD and mild cognitive impairment, had the same proteomic signature in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associated with a pro-inflammatory immune molecular phenotype17. However, whether this extends to other neurodegenerative diseases is unknown.

To identify systemic proteomic changes associated with APOE ε4 carriers who develop neurodegenerative diseases, we used the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC) dataset. Here the plasma and CSF proteome were assessed using the SomaScan assay for 11,270 APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers with AD, FTD, PD, PDD, ALS and nonimpaired controls. Using supervised machine learning, we identified and characterized an APOE ε4 proteome signature across the CSF and plasma. We then confirmed whether the same APOE ε4-enriched pathways in the periphery were mirrored in the brains of carriers and noncarriers. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) proteome of 262 AD, FTD, PDD, PD, ALS and nonimpaired control donors from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) UPenn Proteomics Study was measured using label-free mass spectrometry (MS). In these samples, we also examined postmortem histopathological markers, including the presence of amyloid-β plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis and angiopathy. In FTD and ALS cases, we also examined TDP-43, while in PD and PDD, we examined α-synuclein. Lastly, to assess potential interactions between proteins in the APOE ε4 signature and environmental variables across the diseases, we performed a correlation network analysis between proteins and 18 clinical and lifestyle variables collected in the GNPC dataset, such as hypertension, smoking, and diabetes (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1a).

CSF proteome profiling reveals a distinct signature in APOE ε4 carriers

We used SomaScan (6,340 proteins measured per sample) proteomic data from the GNPC dataset to profile the CSF proteome of 526 AD, 247 PD and 573 nonimpaired control individuals (Supplementary Table 1). An initial principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that there was no clustering across all 6,340 proteins (Fig. 1b). We used mutual information (>0.01) to identify APOE ε4 proteins. Unlike traditional correlation coefficients, which capture only linear relationships, mutual information can detect both linear and nonlinear associations. This makes it well suited for complex high-dimensional biological data, where relationships between variables may not follow simple patterns. Using this, we identified 229 CSF proteins that were APOE ε4 associated in nonimpaired controls (Methods; Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1a). A subsequent PCA showed that these proteins led to distinct clustering of groups based on APOE genotype (Fig. 1c) and the number of APOE ε4 alleles (Fig. 1d) independently of disease. This effect was further visualized using a heatmap showing that APOE ε4 proteins were upregulated or downregulated based on genotype but not disease (Fig. 1e). Many of these APOE ε4 proteins were also identified in our earlier work profiling the CSF proteome of APOE ε4 carriers with mild cognitive impairment and AD from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative cohort17 further highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our finding.

Using classification and regression trees (CART) modeling, we showed that these 229 CSF proteins were able to reliably (performance metrics > 0.95) predict APOE ε4 carriers from noncarriers across AD and PD (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1f). We also found that there were no sex differences in the ability of our identified proteins to distinguish between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1f). To determine if the APOE ε4 signature might be due to differences in amyloid-β levels between carriers and noncarriers, we examined CSF amyloid-β A4 protein levels measured in the SomaScan assay. A Wilcoxon test indicated that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in CSF amyloid-β A4 protein levels between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers with AD, PD or nonimpaired controls (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

A functional enrichment analysis in the protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) database18 of the CSF APOE ε4 proteins revealed significant (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) enrichment for viral processes, apoptosis, rhythmicity, cellular processes, protein phosphorylation and folding and RNA/DNA processes (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 3). Given that the most significant enrichment was observed for viral processes, we also performed enrichment analysis for immune pathway-specific processes. Immune-specific Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways revealed that APOE ε4 proteins were enriched in numerous infection-related pathways, including hepatitis, herpes, measles, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and influenza A. There was also significant enrichment for T cell, B cell and inflammatory signaling cascades, including Toll‑like receptor (TLR), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 17 (IL-17), JAK/STAT and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB; Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 3). Using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas19, we performed an immune cell subtype enrichment analysis on APOE ε4 proteins. Across innate immune cells, APOE ε4 proteins were the most enriched in nonclassical and intermediate monocytes. In adaptive immune cells, memory CD8 T cells were the most enriched for APOE ε4 proteins, followed by Tregs and memory CD4 T cells. In innate-like T cells and lymphoid cells (mixed), both natural killer (NK) cells and γδ T cells showed APOE ε4 enrichment (Fig. 1i). Given that we found enrichment for hepatitis KEGG pathways, we also performed a cell-type-specific enrichment analysis in the liver. Across parenchymal cells, APOE ε4 proteins were the most enriched in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, in line with both cell types being the primary producers of the APOE4 proteoform in the liver20 (Fig. 1j).

These results show that APOE ε4 carriers have a distinct CSF proteomic signature characterized by enriched viral processes and pro-inflammatory immune pathways and cells. We find enrichment across hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the liver, further implicating APOE4 proteoform synthesis sites in the periphery. This finding may also be reflective of brain-liver signaling and liver responses to neuroinflammation21. Notably, these changes were independent of neurodegenerative disease and sex, suggesting that APOE ε4 carriers share a common molecular phenotype.

We next sought to determine whether the APOE ε4 CSF proteome changes observed were also reflected in the plasma. Further leveraging the GNPC dataset, we performed plasma proteome profiling of 2,929 AD, 75 FTD, 169 PDD, 422 PD, 230 ALS and 6,099 nonimpaired control individuals with and without an APOE ε4 allele (Supplementary Table 1). A PCA of all 6,340 proteins revealed no group clustering (Fig. 2a). Using mutual information, we identified 58 plasma proteins in nonimpaired controls (Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2a) that were associated with APOE genotype (Fig. 2b) and led to clustering based on the number of APOE ε4 alleles (Fig. 2c) rather than by neurodegenerative disease. A heatmap also revealed that the 58 APOE ε4 plasma changes were upregulated or downregulated based on genotype (Fig. 2d). Two of these proteins, TBCA and LRRN1, were also identified in the serum of healthy APOE ε4 centenarians22, providing further external validation of our finding and the importance of these proteins in APOE ε4 carriers.

This showed significant (FDR < 0.05) enrichment for immune, infection and pro-inflammatory pathways. h, Immune cell-type-specific enrichment analysis of APOE ε4 plasma proteins showing involvement across the innate, adaptive and innate-like T cells and lymphoid cells (mixed). i, Liver cell-type-specific enrichment analysis of APOE ε4 CSF proteins showing involvement across parenchymal and immune cells.

CART models using these 58 proteins as predictors showed a strong ability to differentiate between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers across each of the neurodegenerative disease groups (performance metrics > 0.85; Extended Data Table 2). CART modeling revealed that there were no sex differences in the APOE ε4 plasma signature (Extended Data Table 2 and Fig. 2e). We extended this to show that there were no effects of race. Here we trained our models on White individuals and tested them using proteomic data from either Black/African American or American Indian/Alaskan Native individuals. In both cases, our models were reliably able to predict APOE ε4 carriers from noncarriers (Extended Data Table 2 and Fig. 2e). We also compared amyloid-β A4 protein levels between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers across neurodegenerative diseases to determine if the plasma APOE ε4 signature was related to amyloid-β pathology. A Wilcoxon test revealed that there were no significant differences in plasma amyloid-β A4 protein between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

APOE ε4 plasma processes were significantly enriched for biological processes, including apoptosis, cellular processes, protein processes and RNA/DNA processes (Supplementary Table 5). As in the CSF, viral processes were the most significantly enriched biological process (Fig. 2f). This was further supported by similar KEGG immune and infection pathway enrichments, including EBV and hepatitis (Fig. 2g). There was also significant enrichment for inflammatory and cytokine signaling pathways, including TNF, IL-17, TLR and NF-κB (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 5). Among immune cell subtypes, nonclassical and intermediate monocytes were implicated in APOE ε4 proteins, as seen in the CSF. Unlike the CSF, however, basophils were enriched for APOE ε4 proteins. Of adaptive immune cell subtypes, plasma APOE ε4 proteins were enriched for memory CD8 T cells, Tregs and naive CD8 T cells. NK cells and γδ T cells were also associated with APOE ε4 (Fig. 2h). In the liver, we found cell-type-specific enrichment primarily for Kupffer cells and T cells and, unlike the CSF, very little enrichment for hepatocytes.

Our results demonstrate that genotype-specific proteomic changes observed in the CSF are also reflected in the plasma of APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers, consistently indicating pro-inflammatory immune dysregulation across multiple pathways and immune cell populations. The APOE ε4 proteomic signature remained independent of neurodegenerative disease status and sex, with CART models showing strong predictive power for carrier status. We further showed that this signature generalizes across racial groups, underscoring its robustness and broad applicability. Unlike in the CSF, plasma APOE ε4 proteins were not enriched in hepatocytes but were significantly enriched in Kupffer and T cells, suggesting that peripheral immune activation is distinct from central nervous system (CNS) immune-metabolic signaling along the liver-brain axis in APOE ε4 carriers.

We then sought to determine whether the proteomic changes observed in the periphery were reflective of central changes in APOE ε4 carriers and to further validate our findings from the GNPC cohort. To do this, we leveraged label-free MS proteomic and postmortem histopathological data from the AMP-AD UPenn Proteomics study for the dlPFC of 49 AD, 31 FTD, 47 PDD, 33 PD, 55 ALS and 47 nonimpaired individual donors (Supplementary Table 6). SomaScan and label-free MS proteomic assays had different coverage of specific proteins; therefore, we focused on confirming enrichment for biological processes and pathways across the CSF, plasma, and dlPFC of carriers and noncarriers. We again used mutual information to identify APOE ε4 proteins from the dlPFC within each group independently. Across all neurodegenerative disease groups, we identified 248 APOE ε4 proteins (Supplementary Table 7). This was confirmed with PCAs showing clustering based on APOE genotype (Extended Data Fig. 3a–l and Supplementary Table 7). Functional enrichment analyses revealed that three of the main biological processes (viral processes, negative regulation of apoptosis, and protein folding) identified in the CSF and plasma were also significantly enriched in the dlPFC of APOE ε4 carriers across all neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 8). Further, four of the most significantly enriched KEGG immune pathways in the CSF and plasma were also identified in APOE ε4 carriers in a disease-independent manner, including EBV, hepatitis B, viral carcinogenesis and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Table 8).

Previous research suggests that APOE ε4 carriers may develop neurodegenerative pathology, including amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, even in the absence of symptomatic disease8,23,24,25,26. We therefore sought to determine if the changes seen in APOE ε4 carriers may be due to the presence of APOE ε4-driven brain pathology. There was no relationship between APOE ε4 and tau or thio-S-positive plaques across nonimpaired controls and disease groups (Supplementary Table 9). In FTD, PDD, and PD, there was also no relationship between APOE ε4 and α-synuclein and, in FTD and ALS, no relationship with TDP-43 (Supplementary Table 9). Although none of the neurodegenerative disease groups showed a relationship between APOE ε4 and angiopathy, there was a small statistically significant association found in nonimpaired controls (Supplementary Table 9).

Taken together, these findings suggest a relationship between peripheral and central proteomic changes. Both are characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, further highlighting that APOE ε4 carriers have systemic immune dysregulation. This demonstrates that the major proteome changes seen in the periphery of APOE ε4 carriers are indeed reflective of ongoing processes in the brain and that peripheral processes may actively contribute to or even drive changes in the brain proteome. Notably, APOE ε4-associated changes are independent of neurodegenerative disease, whether measured simply by diagnosis or by specific pathological changes in the brain.

Given that APOE ε4 carriers across neurodegenerative diseases share major underlying systemic proteomic changes, we sought to better understand additional drivers that may be disease specific. To do this, we leveraged the GNPC dataset and a correlation network analysis to identify the relationship between APOE ε4 proteins and demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, such as age, blood pressure, and smoking (Supplementary Table 1 and see Extended Data Fig. 4 for a stratification by comorbidities for APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers). Of the 40 proteins that overlapped across the CSF and plasma of APOE ε4 carriers, we chose 16 of these that had more than 20 functional connections (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 10). These proteins represent central ‘nodes' in the protein–protein network, suggesting that any changes are more likely to disrupt diverse pathways and functions27. Of note, two of the overlapping proteins, APOE and PHGDH, were differentially expressed in opposite directions across the plasma and CSF. Both proteins were upregulated in the CSF but downregulated in the plasma. As we had a higher number of individuals with plasma samples, thereby improving statistical power, the correlation analysis reflects the decreased APOE and PHGDH levels observed in plasma.

We first calculated Spearman's rank correlation (continuous variables) or correlation ratio (categorical variables) for APOE and demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables in nonimpaired, AD, PDD and PD APOE ε4 carriers. Due to low numbers, we were unable to calculate similar correlations for FTD and ALS. Our analyses revealed unique, neurodegenerative disease-specific significant relationships with APOE (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 11). APOE was associated with sex and race in AD, with diabetes in PD, with resting heart rate and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in PDD, and with age, body mass index, and hypertension in nonimpaired controls. A key limitation is the lack of longitudinal data for nonimpaired APOE ε4 carriers, who may later develop neurodegenerative disease. Thus, observed associations with clinical variables may reflect preclinical disease. We extended these correlation analyses to the remaining 15 central node APOE ε4 proteins. This analysis further identified that APOE ε4 central node proteins are significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables in a disease-specific way in APOE ε4 carriers (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 11).

Together, these findings indicate that although all APOE ε4 carriers have the same underlying proteomic signature, specific proteins within this signature are differentially correlated with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables. Critically, these correlations were neurodegenerative disease specific.

The GNPC dataset represents a substantial advancement in neurodegenerative disease research, by providing a real-world clinical proteomic dataset that comprises over 35,000 (11,270 with APOE genotype) individuals across AD, FTD, PDD, PD, ALS and normal aging from across more than 20 clinical sites in the US, UK and Europe28. This enabled us to ask whether the APOE ε4-associated proteomic signature is shared across multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Our results demonstrate that all APOE ε4 carriers, irrespective of neurodegenerative disease, have a unique proteome signature that extends across the plasma and CSF. Unlike prospectively designed cohorts, the GNPC dataset reflects real-world clinical heterogeneity, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our findings. This signature is associated with pro-inflammatory immune dysregulation and an enrichment for circulating immune cells, including monocytes, memory CD8 and γδ T cells, Tregs and NK cells. This molecular phenotype extends to the brains of APOE ε4 carriers in a similar disease-independent manner and is not associated with the presence of any disease-specific brain pathology (Fig. 5). Although all APOE ε4 carriers have a systemic immune-related proteome signature, we find that the relationships between proteins within this signature are uniquely associated with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables in a neurodegenerative disease-specific manner. Notably, this suggests that although the biological changes associated with APOE ε4 carriage are essential for neurodegeneration, broadly, interactions with underlying biological vulnerability and the environment may be key for driving the pathogenesis of the specific neurodegenerative disease.

APOE ε4 carriers across different neurodegenerative diseases share a common systemic proteomic change reflective of pro-inflammatory immune dysregulation. The figure is created with BioRender.com.

There is evidence that the APOE ε4 genotype is a modern-day example of antagonistic pleiotropy. In younger adults, APOE ε4 is associated with increased survival and fertility in environments with high levels of infectious disease29,30,31,32. For example, healthy individuals who are APOE ε4 heterozygotes exhibit heightened cytokine release, increased plasma TNF levels, a more pronounced hyperthermic response and an earlier onset of IL-6 production following immune challenge with TLR2/TLR4/TLR5 ligands or lipopolysaccharide33. While this immune response protects younger APOE ε4 carriers from infectious diseases, prolonged states of inflammation and cytokine release are likely deleterious with age34,35. Although this study identified a proteomic signature indicative of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, a limitation is the absence of direct measures of routine inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein or cytokines. Future studies should incorporate these markers in prospectively designed cohorts to clarify their association with APOE ε4.

To date, the biological effects of APOE ε4 carriage have largely only been studied in the context of AD. A notable finding of our study is that the pro-inflammatory molecular phenotype associated with APOE ε4 extends to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases, including FTD, PDD, PD and ALS. This raises two key considerations. First, our findings underscore the need to shift focus from the continued identification of genetic risk loci via genome-wide association studies toward functional characterization of established variants36. Notably, the absence of a statistically significant association between a variant and a specific disease phenotype does not preclude biological relevance. Despite APOE ε4 being overrepresented in the AD cohort, we observe a consistent molecular signature associated with APOE ε4 across multiple neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting an underrecognized role for this variant beyond AD that may have been overlooked due to its historically strong link with AD risk. Second, our data support reconceptualizing APOE ε4 not only as a disease-specific risk factor but also as a broader susceptibility allele contributing to shared pathogenic mechanisms across neurodegenerative diseases. It remains unclear, however, why APOE ε4 is more strongly associated with AD in terms of prevalence despite exhibiting systemic biological effects across neurodegenerative diseases. One possibility is that interactions between APOE ε4 and additional age-related, environmental, or comorbid factors may selectively amplify neurodegenerative pathways characteristic of AD. Another possibility is that CNS-specific vulnerabilities or cellular contexts (for example, in hippocampal circuits or dopaminergic neurons) modulate how the APOE ε4 inflammatory phenotype manifests clinically. Thus, while APOE ε4 confers a shared biological susceptibility, disease expression likely depends on a combination of genetic background, cellular context(s), and lifetime exposures. Large-scale integrative efforts, such as the GNPC, which harmonize data across distinct disease cohorts into unified datasets, provide a powerful framework for advancing this line of inquiry. By enabling cross-disease comparisons, such efforts may help delineate modifiers that influence why some APOE ε4 carriers develop AD while others remain healthy or develop different neurodegenerative diseases. This has important implications for prognosis and risk stratification in midlife individuals who carry APOE ε4.

A limitation of our study is the absence of validated biomarkers (for example, CSF p-tau217) to confirm clinical diagnoses, which reflects both the nature of the GNPC dataset and global heterogeneity in clinical practice28. However, several features mitigate concerns regarding potential misdiagnosis. First, the APOE ε4 signature was derived from nonimpaired individuals. While it is possible that a minority of these nonimpaired individuals harbored asymptomatic pathology (for example, asymptomatic AD), the majority would be free of overt disease, reducing the likelihood of confounding results. Second, the consistent presence of the signature across all APOE ε4 carriers, irrespective of clinical diagnosis, supports its generalizability and suggests it reflects a broader APOE ε4-related biological phenotype rather than disease-specific changes. Finally, we validate our findings using postmortem brain proteomics and histopathology, where diagnostic certainty is highest. Here APOE ε4 status was not associated with hallmark pathologies, including amyloid-β, tau, TDP-43 or α-synuclein, across respective disease groups. This postmortem validation reinforces the robustness of our findings. Future studies would benefit from prospective cohorts incorporating validated CSF or plasma biomarkers to confirm and extend these observations.

An unexpected finding of our study was that plasma neurofilament light (NEFL) levels were lower in APOE ε4 carriers across neurodegenerative diseases, despite NEFL's growing recognition as a biomarker of neurodegeneration37. Prior studies have reported conflicting results—some found no association38,39, another reported increased levels in APOE ε4 carriers40, while others using the SomaScan41 and Simoa42 assays observed decreased levels, consistent with our findings. These discrepancies may reflect differences in sample size, with studies reporting decreased NEFL levels generally including larger cohorts (~600 to 5,000 participants, and 9,924 in our study). Alternatively, APOE ε4-related blood–brain barrier (BBB) or metabolic dysfunction may alter peripheral clearance of NEFL and affect its plasma or CSF concentration. These results raise important questions about the reliability of NEFL as a stand-alone biomarker and underscore the need for mechanistic studies and a shift toward precision biomarkers that integrate genetic and environmental context.

In our study, key peripheral inflammatory states in APOE ε4 carriers were mirrored in the CNS. Notably, brain proteomics performed using label-free MS orthogonally validated findings from SomaScan-based CSF and plasma analyses. While SomaScan aptamer technology offers high-throughput protein quantification, it is relatively insensitive to proteoform diversity, including post-translational modifications43, a limitation when examining signaling pathways and protein networks where such modifications are functionally significant. In contrast, MS enables the detection of broader proteoforms, offering an independent assessment of protein abundance and pathway enrichment. The concordance of APOE ε4-associated protein signatures and enrichment patterns across plasma, CSF and brain proteomic datasets suggests that our findings are not artifacts of platform-specific biases but likely reflect underlying biology. Supporting this interpretation, we observed enrichment of APOE ε4-associated proteins in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the CSF, but only in Kupffer cells and T cells in plasma. This pattern implies that plasma reflects chronic peripheral immune activation, whereas the CSF may capture liver-brain axis-mediated inflammatory signaling in APOE ε4 carriers21. Further experimental studies are warranted to validate these mechanisms. Prospective cohort studies incorporating cross-platform, multi-tissue analyses from the same individuals will be essential to confirm and expand upon these observations.

While the exact mechanisms underlying the mirroring of peripheral and central pro-inflammatory states remain unclear, they may involve interactions between pro-inflammatory peripheral immune cells and the BBB. A recent study of individuals with long COVID-19 demonstrated that hyperactive peripheral blood mononuclear cells adhere to the endothelial cells of the BBB, driving inflammation, degradation, and symptoms of brain fog44. In support of this, cognitively healthy APOE ε4 carriers exhibit early markers of BBB dysfunction in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe45. As the BBB becomes increasingly compromised, it allows the infiltration of blood-derived proteins and pro-inflammatory immune cells into the brain, contributing to exacerbated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration46. In our study, we identify enriched pro-inflammatory immune cell subpopulations, including nonclassical and intermediate monocytes47,48, memory CD8+ T cells49, γδ T cells50 and NK cells51,52. These immune cell types may represent peripheral blood mononuclear cells that interact with the BBB to promote neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 carriers. Given that APOE ε4 is linked to a shared molecular phenotype across neurodegenerative diseases, this hypothesis is consistent with current understanding. Healthy, nonimpaired APOE ε4 carriers have a systemic pro-inflammatory phenotype17 (and as we have shown here), early signs of BBB disruption45, alterations in brain activity and connectivity53,54, and sleep disturbances55, all of which are known to be risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, broadly56,57,58. Further supporting this is the recent evidence that vaccinations protect against dementia59,60, including the shingles vaccines Zostavax61 and Shingrix62. Although none of these studies explicitly examined the interactive effects between vaccination status and APOE ε4 genotype, the fact that more than 60% of individuals with dementia are APOE ε4 carriers63 suggests that APOE ε4 may represent a critical modifier of the observed associations, warranting further investigation. Future studies in human disease-relevant models, such as patient stem cell-derived organoids, are needed to further elucidate these mechanisms.

If all APOE ε4 carriers share a common underlying biological vulnerability to neurodegeneration, an important question is what determines which specific neurodegenerative disease they develop. This likely reflects complex interactions between genetic risk and environmental exposures64. In our study, proteins within the APOE ε4 signature were differentially correlated with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables, in a neurodegenerative disease-specific manner. This suggests that genotype–environment interactions may modulate disease trajectories in APOE ε4 carriers. While limited by the variables consistently collected across the GNPC's global real-world cohorts, our findings highlight meaningful associations that warrant further investigation. Future prospective studies should incorporate more detailed environmental and behavioral measures, such as physical activity, diet, sleep, substance use and immunization history, to better characterize modifiers of neurodegenerative disease risk in APOE ε4 carriers. Given the cross-sectional nature of our study, we cannot infer causality or perform mediation analyses, as clinical variables like hypertension may have arisen after disease onset. One plausible mechanism is that APOE ε4 carriers exhibit heightened inflammatory responses to environmental or pathological stressors, including comorbidities such as hypercholesterolemia and ischemic heart disease, to which they are predisposed65,66,67. This suggests that the pro-inflammatory phenotype of APOE ε4 carriers may be, at least in part, independent of cardiovascular comorbidities. Our findings further support this interpretation. Our PANTHER biological processes enrichment analyses of the APOE ε4 CSF proteome showed no significant enrichment of cardiovascular-related processes. In the plasma, we found only a single enrichment for heart development; however, this was modest relative to the top enrichment of viral processes. These results suggest that additional environmental or pathological insults may act synergistically with a genetically primed pro-inflammatory state to drive neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 carriers. Another interpretation of our data, however, is that individuals with pre-existing neurodegenerative diseases are more likely to develop comorbidities68,69, such as hypertension, which may be a consequence of neurodegenerative processes rather than a precursory event. Longitudinal studies tracking APOE ε4 carriers over time will be essential to disentangle causal pathways and advance personalized prevention strategies.

Neurodegenerative disease risk is reflective of a complex polygenic architecture and co-occurring variants in genes, such as TREM2, MAPT, GRN, GBA and LRRK2, may modulate or interact with APOE ε4-associated molecular pathways. For example, joint carriage of APOE ε4 and MAPT mutations resulted in a significantly lower age of FTD onset6. APOE ε4 and GBA and LRRK2 carriers also have the highest risk of PDD13. Genome-wide genetic data beyond APOE genotype, however, are not currently available within the GNPC cohort and therefore could not be included in the present study. Despite this, a key strength of our study is the demonstration that a well-established risk variant for one neurodegenerative disease (APOE ε4 in AD) also exerts a conserved molecularsignature across multiple neurodegenerative conditions. These findings provide proteomic evidence that a single risk variant is implicated across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum. This indicates the need for a conceptual shift in the field, moving away from viewing genetic risk variants as disease specific and toward recognizing their potential as shared, pleiotropic modifiers of neurodegenerative vulnerability. Future work, therefore, would greatly benefit from a focus on the role of other genetic variants across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, even if they are enriched in only one disease.

Overall, our study provides a conceptual and translational advance in understanding APOE ε4-mediated risk for neurodegeneration. We identify a conserved, systemic pro-inflammatory immune proteomic signature associated with APOE ε4 across plasma, CSF and brain, irrespective of neurodegenerative disease or pathology. Notably, this signature is also present in asymptomatic individuals, suggesting it precedes clinical symptom onset and reflects an intrinsic biological vulnerability. The ability to detect this signature in plasma, a minimally invasive and clinically accessible biofluid, also offers promising opportunities for blood-based precision biomarkers to identify individuals at risk before symptom onset. Together, these findings demonstrate that APOE ε4 confers an intrinsic biological vulnerability characterized by a chronic pro-inflammatory immune phenotype that is independent of downstream disease processes. While this chronic immune activation may predispose APOE ε4 carriers to neurodegeneration, it is unlikely to be sufficient alone to drive the development of neurodegenerative disease. Instead, the transition to clinical disease likely involves complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and modifiable environmental, lifestyle, and clinical factors. By linking the APOE ε4 signature to such factors, our findings provide actionable insights for early intervention and prevention. They also establish a roadmap for future exploration of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions, including polygenic and epistatic effects. More broadly, our findings reframe APOE ε4 as a pleiotropic immune modulator rather than an AD-specific gene, underscoring the need for cross-disease, genetically informed models of risk stratification and therapy. Finally, this work lays the foundation for future wet laboratory-based mechanistic studies to elucidate how APOE ε4 shapes immune function and neuroinflammatory signaling, a critical step toward developing targeted and individualized immunotherapies for early and preclinical disease.

The GNPC cohort represents the largest collection of SomaScan proteomic data for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and nonimpaired controls sourced from study sites across the USA, UK and Europe. In the present study, we included 11,270 individuals from the GNPC cohort, with 6,672 nonimpaired controls, 3,455 AD, 75 FTD, 169 PDD, 669 PD and 230 ALS individuals. Of these, 4,325 individuals were APOE ε4 carriers (either heterozygous or homozygous) and 6,945 were non-APOE ε4 carriers. All included individuals in the study provided either CSF or plasma samples, but none provided both. Individuals were diagnosed based on diagnostic criteria from each research group, as described in the GNPC cohort summary paper1. Cognitive impairment for AD and PDD patients was further assessed using a clinical dementia rating score of ≥1, Mini-Mental State Exam score of ≤24 and/or Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of ≤23. Most individuals with AD had cognitive impairment scores indicative of mild or moderate AD. We excluded individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the current study due to its heterogeneity as a clinical diagnosis, and because it does not necessarily reflect neurodegenerative pathology. CSF or plasma samples were collected from all participants at a single timepoint along with demographic and clinical variables (Supplementary Table 1). Participants from each of the included study sites in the GNPC cohort provided written informed consent and studies were approved by the relevant institution's ethics committee28.

The AMP-AD UPenn Proteomics Study is a cohort of autopsy-collected samples from the dlPFC of 49 AD, 31 FTD (with TDP-43 inclusions), 47 PDD, 33 PD, 55 ALS and 47 nonimpaired individual donors from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Brain Bank (https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn21438414). Individual diagnoses were confirmed through postmortem neuropathological evaluation for neuritic plaque distribution according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD criteria70 and neurofibrillary tangle pathology according to the Braak staging system71. Other neuropathologic assessments, including for α-synuclein, TDP-43, gliosis and angiopathy, were made in line with established criteria and guidelines72,73. Demographic variables for the cohort are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Human postmortem tissues were acquired under proper institutional review board protocols.

CSF and plasma proteomics in the GNPC cohort were performed using the SomaScan v4.1 assay, which measures approximately 7,000 proteins74,75. This technology uses aptamer-based approaches, specifically slow off-rate modified aptamers, which incorporate chemically modified nucleotides that bind with high specificity and affinity to target proteins74. SomaLogic provides ‘raw' data that has been standardized, normalized, and calibrated, including using adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood. Protein measurements are provided in relative fluorescent units. Aptamers were mapped to Uniprot before being included in the GNPC cohort dataset. Details on the creation and harmonization of this dataset are described elsewhere28. Before our own analyses, we log2 transformed and standardized training and testing datasets separately.

Proteins from postmortem brain homogenates from the dlPFC were measured using label-free MS on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer as previously described76. Proteins included in this study were identified using MaxQuant' MaxLFQ (label-free quantification) algorithm. Normalized label-free quantitation protein intensities were extracted from the proteinGroups.txt MaxQuant output file using a custom R script (LoaderAndBatchCorrection-UPenn354cases.R)76. To account for missing protein quantitation values in the dataset, we imputed values using the median for proteins with ≤20% missing values and excluded those proteins with ≥20% missing values.

We identified APOE ε4-associated proteins using mutual information, a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of information one variable provides about another77. In the context of our study, it measures how informative each protein is for distinguishing APOE ε4 carriers from noncarriers. A mutual information score of zero indicates no association, while higher values indicate greater dependency between a protein and APOE ε4 status. We used a cutoff of ≥0.01 to indicate proteins that were likely to be associated with APOE ε4 carrier status. For CSF and plasma, we used nonimpaired controls to identify APOE ε4-associated proteins. This ensured that we were identifying proteins in only those individuals who are not symptomatic for any one neurodegenerative disease. Appropriate feature selection (identification of proteins specifically associated with APOE ε4) was further confirmed using PCA and heatmap. In the brain, we used mutual information to identify APOE ε4 proteins specific to each group of individuals. PCA was then used to confirm that within each group, APOE ε4-identified proteins clustered based on APOE ε4 carrier status. For visualization of differential protein abundance, volcano plots were constructed using log2 (fold change(FC)) on the x axis and −log10-transformed adjusted P values on the y axis. Plots show fold change and significance thresholds that were applied at log2(FC) = ± 0.585 (corresponding to a 1.5-fold change) and FDR-adjusted P < 0.05, respectively. Mutual information was calculated in R (v4.4.1) using the package ‘FSelectorRcpp'78 and PCA plots and heatmaps were made using ‘ggplot2'79 and ‘pheatmap', respectively.

The generalizability of our identified APOE ε4 proteins across different neurodegenerative diseases was tested. We performed this analysis using supervised machine learning with CART via the ‘caret' package in R (v4.4.1). For all CART models, we first split the dataset into a 70% training and validation dataset and a 30% withheld (unseen) testing dataset. Model training and evaluation were conducted using ‘caret' with a fivefold cross-validation procedure repeated five times. Where classes (groups) were imbalanced, we addressed this by using upsampling. Model performance was assessed using the 30% unseen dataset and several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve. To identify potential sex-specific differences in the generalizability of APOE ε4 proteins, we trained and tested the CART models on a mixed sample of male and female APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers. To assess any race-specific effects in plasma, we trained the CART models on White APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers and then tested them using only individuals of another race (Black/African American or American Indian/Alaskan Native).

To identify a potential relationship between APOE ε4 carrier status and postmortem histopathology in the dlPFC, we used a linear regression. Postmortem histopathology data for all donors included tau, thio-S-positive plaques, and angiopathy. Additional measures for AD and nonimpaired donors included antibody-positive plaques, Thal amyloid score, and gliosis. FTD, PDD and PD donors also had postmortem histopathological assessments for α-synuclein. FTD and ALS donors included TDP-43 assessments.

To determine a potential relationship between overlapping CSF and plasma proteins identified as being APOE ε4-specific and demographic, clinical and lifestyle variables, we performed a correlation network analysis. Protein levels were based on those measured in the plasma, although only overlapping APOE ε4 identified across both CSF and plasma were included. Before computing any correlations, rows with missing values or encoded as an indeterminate response (for example, ‘unsure', coded as −1 or NA) were excluded on a pairwise basis. This ensured that each test was conducted only on complete and valid data. For associations between two continuous variables, we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ). For associations between categorical variables and continuous protein expression values, we employed a correlation ratio (η2), which measures the proportion of variance in the continuous variable explained by the grouping variable. This was calculated by fitting a linear model with the continuous variable as the outcome and the categorical variable as the predictor. The coefficient of determination (R2) from the model was interpreted as η2. The statistical significance of the association was determined using ANOVA (P < 0.05). Categorical variables included binary indicators (for example, presence/absence of comorbidities) as well as variables with more than two levels (for example, ‘yes', ‘no', ‘unsure'). All categorical variables were explicitly converted to factors, and associations were computed only where at least two factor levels were present in the subset of complete cases. The correlation network analysis figure was created using GraphPad Prism (v10.0.0 for Windows).

Protein–protein enrichment analyses to assess the functions enriched for APOE ε4 proteins were done using NetworkAnalyst (v3.0)80,81,82. Here generic protein–protein interactions were identified using a first-order network from the International Molecular Exchange Consortium interactome database83 and InnateDB84. Network enrichment for biological processes was performed using the PANTHER classification system18 and KEGG pathways85. Significance was determined by an FDR of >0.05.

Immune cell-type-specific enrichment analyses for immune and liver cells were done using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/, v23; Ensembl v109)19. For each APOE ε4 protein, we identified the corresponding protein-coding transcripts per million counts. We then normalized the expression for each cell type using min–max scaling and used heatmaps to visually represent these enrichments. Enrichment bar graphs and heatmaps were created using GraphPad Prism (v10.0.0 for Windows).

(a) Volcano plots showing fold change and adjusted p values for the APOE ε4 CSF proteins. Red dots indicate the proteins with the highest mutual information value (>0.1) for reference to the feature selection method used to identify APOE ε4 proteins. Differential protein abundance was assessed using linear modeling and empirical Bayes moderation. All tests were two-sided, and p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method. Volcano plots display log2 fold change on the x-axis and -log₁₀-transformed adjusted p-values on the y-axis, with thresholds set at log2(FC) = ± 0.585 and FDR-adjusted p < 0.05. (b) Box plots showing amyloid beta A4 protein CSF levels in relative fluorescent units (RFU) across APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers with AD, PD, and non-impaired controls. The center line represents the median, the bounds of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles (interquartile range; IQR), and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× IQR. Data points outside this range are plotted individually as outliers. N = 526 AD, 247 PD, and 573 non-impaired control individuals. Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer's disease; NI: non-impaired controls; PD: Parkinson's disease.

Almost 60 million people globally have neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.Credit: Mark & Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute/Science Photo Library

A gene variant known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease also makes people vulnerable to a host of other age-related brain disorders, from Parkinson's disease to motor neuron disease. The gene variant, a version of apolipoprotein E called APOE ε4, produces a distinct set of proteins that contribute to chronic inflammation, finds an analysis1 using the largest proteomics database for neurodegenerative disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases affect more than 57 million people worldwide. Researchers know that people who carry the APOE ε4 variant have an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but studies are beginning to implicate this version, or allele, of APOE in other neurodegenerative diseases. 

Caitlin Finney and Artur Shvetcov, who study neurodegenerative diseases at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, Australia, and their colleagues wanted to better understand how this genetic risk factor contributes to disease. They took advantage of a newly established proteomics database that allowed them to look beyond individual diseases, says Finney.

The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC) data set2 includes samples from more than 18,600 individuals, mainly of European ancestry, including many with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, a form of motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and types of dementia, as well as individuals without neurological disorders. The consortia collected around 250 million measurements of proteins found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, taken at some two dozen clinics across the United States and Europe. “It's one of the most powerful databases that we have available for proteomics right now,” says Maryam Shoai, a bioinformatician at University College London.

In their analysis, Finney, Shvetcov and their collaborators looked at proteomics data from 11,270 individuals, some 38% of whom were carriers of the APOE ε4 variant, and 40% of whom had some form of neurodegenerative condition. “It's a huge study,” says Tomas Deierborg, who studies neuroinflammation at Lund University in Sweden. The results are published today in Nature Medicine, along with a suite of other papers using the GNPC database, which has also been made publically accessible today.

The researchers identified a group of proteins — a couple of hundred in the cerebrospinal fluid and almost 60 in blood plasma — linked to the presence of the APOE ε4 variant in healthy individuals. A similar protein signature was observed when the team analysed data from a separate collection of brain tissue samples taken postmortem from individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.

The anti-obesity medication tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity, reduced obesity-associated breast cancer growth in a mouse model, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, California.

"Obesity is a significant risk factor for breast cancer, and while it is very preliminary data, our studies in mice suggest that these new anti-obesity drugs may be a way to reduce obesity-associated breast cancer risk or improve outcomes," said study author Amanda Kucinskas, B.S., a Ph.D. candidate in the labs of Drs. Erin Giles and Kanakadurga Singer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Existing research has shown that having obesity can lead to worse breast cancer outcomes compared to those who do not have obesity, and weight loss can improve outcomes. However, there are many challenges with traditional weight loss methods.

Kucinskas and colleagues leveraged tirzepatide, one of a new class of effective anti-obesity medications that target GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors. The researchers sought to learn whether or not tirzepatide would reduce obesity-associated breast cancer growth.

This mouse study included 16 mice. The 9-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a 40% high-fat diet and housed in a warm environment to induce obesity. At 32 weeks of age, the mice with obesity were randomly assigned injections of tirzepatide or a placebo every other day for 16 weeks. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly.

The researchers found that the anti-obesity drug reduced body weight and body fat by approximately 20% in mice, similar to the amount of weight loss achieved by women on this drug. They found this was primarily due to a loss of adipose mass, with a reduction in adipose depot weights compared to controls.

The anti-obesity drug also reduced tumor volume compared to the controls. At the end of the study, the researchers found that tumor volume was significantly correlated with body weight, total adipose mass and the amount of fat stored in the liver.

"While these are very preliminary results, they suggest that this new anti-obesity drug may also have a beneficial impact on breast cancer outcomes," Kucinskas said.

Ongoing studies are underway in collaboration with Dr. Steve Hursting's lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to separate the weight loss from the tumor-specific effects of tirzepatide.

Carbon–sulfur bond-forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis largely involve Lewis acid/base chemistry with relatively few examples catalysed by radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzymes. The latter have been limited to radical-mediated sulfur insertion into carbon–hydrogen bonds with the sulfur atom originating from a sacrificial auxiliary iron–sulfur cluster. Here we show that the radical SAM enzyme AbmM encoded in the albomycin biosynthetic gene cluster catalyses a sulfur-for-oxygen swapping reaction, transforming the furanose ring of cytidine 5′-diphosphate to a thiofuranose moiety that is essential for the antibacterial activity of albomycin δ2. Thus, in addition to its canonical function of mediating the reductive cleavage of SAM, the radical SAM catalytic cluster of AbmM appears to play a role in providing the sulfur introduced during the AbmM-catalysed reaction. These discoveries not only establish the origin of the thiofuranose core in albomycin δ2 but, more importantly, also emphasize the functional diversity of radical SAM catalysis.

Source data

(a) Detection of l-methionine by LCMS. EIC traces corresponding to the [M + H]+ signal of l-methionine (m/z = 150.0583) are shown. A small amount of l-methionine was detected from the reaction mixture without AbmM or dithionite likely due to nonenzymatic degradation of SAM. (b) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction mixture. The [M – H]− signal at m/z 402.0130 arises from CDP (10, calc for C9H14N3O11P2−, 402.0109). The [M – H]− signal at m/z 433.9849 is consistent with the mass of 13 (calc. for C9H14N3O11P2S−, 433.9830). (c) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction carried out under different conditions. The analysis was conducted after the incubation mixture was treated with CIP. Three EIC traces (m/z = 276.06, 244.09, and 252.2, corresponding to the [M + H]+ signals from 14, 8, and 5′-deoxyadenosine, respectively) are overlaid. (d) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction with different substrates such as cytidine, CMP, CDP and CTP (8-11). Prior to the analysis, the incubation mixture was treated with CIP. Three EIC traces (m/z = 276.06, 244.09, and 252.2, corresponding to the [M + H]+ signals from 14, 8, and 5′-deoxyadenosine, respectively) are overlaid. Other tested compounds, cytidine 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate (2′:3′-cyclic CMP), cytidine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (3′:5′-cyclic CMP), 2′-deoxycytidine (2′-dC), 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-monophosphate (2′-dCMP), 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-diphosphate (2′-dCDP), deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (2′-dCTP), adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), guanosine 5′-diphosphate (GDP), guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP), thymidine 5′-diphosphate (TDP), thymidine 5′-triphosphate (TTP), uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP), and uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP), were not accepted by AbmM as judged by no formation of 5′-deoxyadenosine (data not shown). (e) HPLC analysis of purified 14.

(a) and (b) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction mixture treated with CIP/mBBr or CIP/mBBr/NaBH4. EIC traces corresponding to the [M + H]+ signal from each species are overlaid (m/z 466.14 for 14-bimane and m/z 468.16 for 15).

The measurement conditions are indicated with external magnetic fields parallel to the γ-radiation. Bars show experimental data with statistical uncertainty of the data (the length of the vertical bars), red solid lines represent overall simulations. Simulation parameters are listed in Extended Data Table 2. The sample of 57Fe-PT-AbmM was prepared by overexpressing AbmM in media enriched with 57Fe and subsequently treated with PT before spectroscopic characterization. The sample of 56Fe-PT-57Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster was prepared by overexpressing AbmM ΔRS-cluster variant in media containing natural abundance Fe, followed by treatment of the isolated protein with PT and then reconstitution with 57FeCl3. The resulting sample was further treated with PT. Other combinations such as 56Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster were prepared in an analogous manner. The Fe content analysis yielded (Fe/protein monomer) 2.4 for as-isolated AbmM-ΔRS cluster, 2.4 for 56Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster, 6.0 for 56Fe-PT-57Fe-AbmM-ΔRS cluster, and 2.7 for 56Fe-PT-57Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster.

The megalithic tombs, located in Poland, are likely around 5,500 years old.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The new discovery of uniquely shaped “Polish pyramids” from 5,500 years ago highlights the distinct way early European agricultural societies buried their dead.

Discovered by a team from Adam Mickiewicz University using advanced remote sensing technology during routine field work, the team uncovered “mysterious ground embankments” before confirming them as long earthen tombs constructed during the Funnelbeaker culture of the Neolithic age, according to a translated statement from the Landscape Parks Complex of the Wielkopolska Voivodeship. To locate the tombs after the initial discovery, archaeologists employed aerial laser scanning followed by on-the-ground excavation.

Known as Polish pyramids—or “beds of giants”—the tombs located at the General Dezydery Chlapowski Landscape Park form an elongated trapezoid, with some stretching as long as 656 feet. This particular style of construction has the east end wider and taller than the west, creating a triangle shape or tail-like design from the tomb. Experts believe the use of the trapezoid shape is tied to the style of houses once used by nearby Neolithic cultures, according to the Polish Press Agency.

While the tombs rarely reach taller than 13 feet, the sheer size and design make them a distinct sight in Poland. The most recent find is only the second in the region, while more are known in northwestern Poland. Each tomb was typically covered with cobblestones and massive boulders were placed in front, some weighing as much as 10 tons, a show of the culture's intricate teamwork and tool know-how to make happen.

“The largest boulders that formed the entrance of the tomb are missing,” said Artur Golis, chief specialist for nature and landscape protection from the park, according to the Polish Press Agency. He believes the stones were chipped away over the centuries for use by the residents in other projects.

While fields of the Polish pyramids typically offered a communal location for the region's burials, only the most prominent folks within the society would get buried within the tombs. Each oversized tomb often only contained a single skeleton of a key leader, with the body placed in an upright position and surrounded by grave gifts. The tops of the pyramids were then covered with stones.

“Each generation built its own megalith, honoring the deceased who played a vital role in their community,” said Golis.

While no such skeletons were found in the most recent tomb discovery, archaeologists remain hopeful they can locate grave goods still buried nearby, most likely axes and pottery.

“These artifacts,” Golis said, “could provide further insight into the spiritual and daily lives of the Funnelbeaker people.”

Despite their ominous name and oversized jaws, these animals only measure about one to three millimeters in length.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In Aristotle's De historia animalium (one of the founding texts of zoology), the great Greek thinker pens the very first description of a strange creature that is “found in books” and “look[s] like scorpions; they have no tails, and are very small.” This is a humble pseudoscorpion—a pint-sized false scorpion (as its name suggests) that nonetheless looks a lot like it's more-dangerous, bigger cousin. 

While a member of the class Arachnida, they shouldn't inspire as much fear as other poisonous members of this group. These creatures use poison to subdue prey, but pose no danger to humans, and can actually be immensely beneficial for pest control—they'll munch on moth larvae, mites, and small flies. And true to Aristotle's original observation, they can often be found within the pages of books, as one of their favorite prey species (booklice) feasts on the starch typically found in bookbindings. This explains their nickname: “book scorpions.”

But not all pseudoscorpions call literary habitats their home. A new study—published in the journal PLOS One and led by scientists at Jeonbuk National University—details four new species of “dragon pseudoscorpions,” named as such because of their dragon-like jaws. Far from the cozy confines of a bookshelf, the scientists found these miniscule critters (stretching only between one and three millimeters) in a cave system during a field study. They examined the species using genetics, ecology, and morphology and determined that they had found four new species in total: Spelaeochthonius dugigulensis, S. geumgulensis, S. magwihalmigulensis and S. yamigulensis

“In Korea, pseudoscorpions are a ‘neglected' invertebrate taxon with presently 28 species in 13 genera that belong to eight families,” the authors wrote. “However, a recent preliminary barcoding study has indicated that the species biodiversity in surface habitats must be significantly higher. The subterranean fauna is probably also diverse, but to date, only five pseudoscorpion species have been recorded from caves in South Korea.” 

This new discovery nearly doubles that number. 

Because these creatures live in caves, they have numerous adaptations that are considered “troglomorphic,” due to living in constant darkness. For example, these four new species lack eyes and possess very little body pigmentation, causing them to range from light orange to brown. The pseudoscorpions also possess massive jaws (in relation to their body size), which likely comes in handy when searching for food in complete darkness. 

The researchers theorize that these species are likely endemic to one single cave or karst system, but South Korea is chock-full of caves, with an estimated 2,000 spread across the Taebaek and Sobaek mountain ranges. 

“Many people have believed there is only one species (Spelaeochthonius dentifier) distributed in Korea,” Kyung-Hoon Jeong, a master student and lead author of the study from Jeonbuk National University, told IFLScience. “However, our result was totally different. Each species in the cave has big differences, both in morphology and genetically.”

Like all ecosystems on the planet, caves are threatened by climate change, and understanding the wide variety of animal life in these caves can help scientists conserve them. In order to save a species, it helps to know where to look—and sometimes you won't find the answer in the pages of a good book.

Earth and our entire Milky Way galaxy may sit inside a mysterious giant hole which makes the cosmos expand faster here than in neighboring regions of the universe, astronomers say.

Their theory is a potential solution to the 'Hubble tension' and could help confirm the true age of our universe, which is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old.

The latest research - shared at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting (NAM) in Durham - shows that sound waves from the early universe, "essentially the sound of the Big Bang," support this idea.

The Hubble constant was first proposed by Edwin Hubble in 1929 to express the rate of the universe's expansion. It can be measured by observing the distance of celestial objects and how fast they are moving away from us.

The stumbling block, however, is that extrapolating measurements of the distant, early universe to today using the standard cosmological model predicts a slower rate of expansion than measurements of the nearby, more recent universe. This is the Hubble tension.

"A potential solution to this inconsistency is that our galaxy is close to the center of a large, local void," explained Dr Indranil Banik, of the University of Portsmouth.

"It would cause matter to be pulled by gravity towards the higher density exterior of the void, leading to the void becoming emptier with time.

"As the void is emptying out, the velocity of objects away from us would be larger than if the void were not there. This therefore gives the appearance of a faster local expansion rate."

He added: "The Hubble tension is largely a local phenomenon, with little evidence that the expansion rate disagrees with expectations in the standard cosmology further back in time.

"So a local solution like a local void is a promising way to go about solving the problem."

For the idea to stand up, Earth and our solar system would need to be near the center of a void about a billion light-years in radius and with a density about 20 percent below the average for the universe as a whole.

Directly counting galaxies does support the theory, because the number density in our local universe is lower than in neighbouring regions.

However, the existence of such a large and deep void is controversial because it doesn't mesh particularly well with the standard model of cosmology, which suggests matter today should be more uniformly spread out on such large scales.

Despite this, new data presented by Dr Banik at NAM 2025 shows that baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) - the "sound of the Big Bang" - support the idea of a local void.

"These sound waves travelled for only a short while before becoming frozen in place once the universe cooled enough for neutral atoms to form," he explained.

"They act as a standard ruler, whose angular size we can use to chart the cosmic expansion history.

"A local void slightly distorts the relation between the BAO angular scale and the redshift, because the velocities induced by a local void and its gravitational effect slightly increase the redshift on top of that due to cosmic expansion.

"By considering all available BAO measurements over the last 20 years, we showed that a void model is about one hundred million times more likely than a void-free model with parameters designed to fit the CMB observations taken by the Planck satellite, the so-called homogeneous Planck cosmology."

The next step for researchers is to compare their local void model with other methods to estimate the history of the universe's expansion, such as cosmic chronometers.

This involves looking at galaxies that are no longer forming stars. By observing their spectra, or light, it is possible to find what kinds of stars they have and in what proportion. Since more massive stars have shorter lives, they are absent in older galaxies, providing a way to establish a galaxy's age.

Astronomers can then combine this age with the galaxy's redshift - how much the wavelength of its light has been stretched - which tells us how much the universe has expanded while light from the galaxy was travelling towards us. This sheds light on the universe's expansion history.

The Hubble constant was first proposed by Edwin Hubble in 1929 to express the rate of the universe's expansion. It can be measured by observing the distance of celestial objects and how fast they are moving away from us.

The Hubble tension refers to the discrepancy in the measured expansion rate of the universe, specifically between the value based on observations of the early universe and value related to observations of the local universe.

Baryon acoustic oscillations are a pattern of wrinkles in the density distribution of the clusters of galaxies spread across the universe. They provide an independent way to measure the expansion rate of the universe and how that rate has changed throughout cosmic history.

The Human Phenotype Project (HPP) is a large-scale deep-phenotype prospective cohort. To date, approximately 28,000 participants have enrolled, with more than 13,000 completing their initial visit. The project is aimed at identifying novel molecular signatures with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value, and at developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models for disease onset and progression. The HPP includes longitudinal profiling encompassing medical history, lifestyle and nutrition, anthropometrics, blood tests, continuous glucose and sleep monitoring, imaging and multi-omics data, including genetics, transcriptomics, microbiome (gut, vaginal and oral), metabolomics and immune profiling. Analysis of these data highlights the variation of phenotypes with age and ethnicity and unravels molecular signatures of disease by comparison with matched healthy controls. Leveraging extensive dietary and lifestyle data, we identify associations between lifestyle factors and health outcomes. Finally, we present a multi-modal foundation AI model, trained using self-supervised learning on diet and continuous-glucose-monitoring data, that outperforms existing methods in predicting disease onset. This framework can be extended to integrate other modalities and act as a personalized digital twin. In summary, we present a deeply phenotyped cohort that serves as a platform for advancing biomarker discovery, enabling the development of multi-modal AI models and personalized medicine approaches.

Keith Krehbiel lived with Parkinson's disease for nearly 25 years before agreeing to try a brain implant that might alleviate his symptoms. He had long been reluctant to submit to the surgery. “It was a big move,” he says. But by 2020, his symptoms had become so severe that he grudgingly agreed to go ahead.

Deep-brain stimulation involves inserting thin wires through two small holes in the skull into a region of the brain associated with movement. The hope is that by delivering electrical pulses to the region, the implant can normalize aberrant brain activity and reduce symptoms. Since the devices were first approved almost three decades ago, some 200,000 people have had them fitted to help calm the tremors and rigidity caused by Parkinson's disease. But about 40,000 of those who received devices made after 2020 got them with a special feature that has largely not yet been turned on. The devices can read brain waves and then adapt and tailor the rhythm of their output, in much the same way as a pacemaker monitors and corrects the heart's electrical rhythms, says Helen Bronte-Stewart, a neurologist at Stanford University in California.

Bronte-Stewart received approval to start a clinical trial of this new technology, known as adaptive deep-brain stimulation (aDBS), the same week that Krehbiel was preparing for surgery. He recalls the phone call in which she asked him if he wanted to be her first participant: “I said, ‘Boy, do I!'”

Brain drugs can now cross the once impenetrable blood–brain barrier

Five years on, the results of this 68-person trial, called ADAPT-PD, are under review for publication. Although the exact details are still under wraps, they were convincing enough to earn approval for the technology earlier this year from both US and European regulators.

The results of this study could be a boon for the estimated one million people in the United States and 1.2 million people in Europe who now live with Parkinson's disease — and for Medtronic, the health-care technology company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that manufactures the implants. The seeming success also clears a path for other companies around the world that are racing for approval on advanced devices, says Martijn Beudel, a neurologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center who worked on the trial.

The approaching wave of therapies promises to level up DBS for Parkinson's and other motor conditions. The technology might even help to treat neurological disorders such as Tourette's syndrome and psychiatric conditions, including obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. Several clinicians suggest that the new technology could have even more profound health implications — that is, if funding for US brain-implant research isn't cut.

Since DBS was first approved in Europe and the United States in the late-1990s, the vast majority of devices have been given to people with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's is a progressive disorder, typified by the death of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is key to controlling movements.

Existing drugs that aim to increase dopamine levels can only manage the symptoms. They can't match the constant dopamine production of a healthy brain. “No matter how clever we are with it, we have never been able to exactly mimic the way the brain supplies it,” says Bronte-Stewart. This means that symptoms vary throughout the day — from the unwanted involuntary movements induced by the morning flood of dopamine-mimicking drugs to increased rigidity later in the day as the drugs wear off. The medication also comes with other side effects that vary from person to person. For Krehbiel, it was nausea so severe he had to lie down multiple times a day.

When these become overwhelming, a neurologist might recommend DBS. Implants typically dispense pulses of electrical energy deep into the brain 24 hours a day to regulate aberrant brain signals associated with uncontrollable body movements. Before this year, this always-on approach was the only commercially available form of the therapy.

But continuous DBS can sometimes amplify the drugs' effects — or generate new symptoms. Some of these are harmless: one man with OCD developed a passion for the music of Johnny Cash when his stimulator was turned on, but was uninterested in the artist when it was off1. Other symptoms are cause for more concern, including sudden-onset gambling disorders and other temporary changes in impulse control. More frequently, the addition of stimulation can induce speech impairments, such as slurring, raise the risk of falling and cause some involuntary movements.

A clinician can try to balance the system by adjusting the intensity of stimulation, but there are limits to how precisely it can be calibrated.

Krehbiel was aware of these shortcomings, and it contributed to his sense that DBS was a treatment of last resort. In the late 2010s, his neurologist hinted that big improvements were on the way. “So I thought, wait for the new technology.”

Brain-wave activity is different in people with and without Parkinson's disease. In people with Parkinson's, there are noticeable differences at one range of frequencies, known as β-oscillations (between about 13 and 30 hertz), in a region deep in the brain called the basal ganglia. This region processes sensorimotor, cognitive and mood information.

‘Big leap' for Parkinson's treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials

‘Big leap' for Parkinson's treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials

β-oscillations have become an important marker of motor state. In the early 2000s, researchers at University College London found increasing evidence that people with Parkinson's have intense bursts of activity in this range2. When drug treatments are working, these bursts are less exaggerated. The same is true for DBS3. The more that stimulation normalizes β-oscillations, the better the relief of some symptoms, says Bronte-Stewart.

Aberrant oscillations were dubbed oscillopathies, and in the 2000s, Medtronic started focusing on developing a device that could both read and correct these rhythms, says Tim Denison, a biomedical engineer at the University of Oxford, UK, who was working at the company at the time. “Just like you can build a radio to tune in to an audio channel, can we build a circuit that will tune in to these oscillopathies and help to guide how to adjust the stimulator?” he asks.

By 2006, Denison and his colleagues had built a ‘brain radio', a sensing chip that could tune in to the different frequency bands in which the electrode sits. The next challenge was finding out how changes in particular bands correspond to specific movement problems. That was “a huge part of the first eight to ten years of the research with the investigational hardware”, says Bronte-Stewart. She and other researchers, including Philip Starr at the University of California, San Francisco, used a succession of new prototype devices to map these oscillopathies and adjust to them.

For example, when β-oscillation intensity begins to dip after a dose of medication, aDBS automatically reduces stimulation, keeping β-power in a healthy range. As the medication wears off, it does the opposite (see ‘Fine-tuned stimulation'). In 2019, Bronte-Stewart developed one of the algorithms that would underpin aDBS. When she tested it on 13 people with Parkinson's, it improved the halting movements, called bradykinesia, that are associated with the disease4. It also helped to reduce the inability to take steps, known as freezing of gait, in a study last year5. In a separate study, Starr found that aDBS shortened the duration of volunteers' most bothersome motor disturbances, but without aggravating side effects6.

Other studies have suggested that aDBS reduces speech problems, such as slurring, that were another possible side effect of continuous DBS7,8. “It only suppressed the pathological brain activity,” without suppressing normal speech, says Beudel.

Since 2013, small trials such as these have demonstrated these effects in around 400 people, estimates Robert Raike, the director of neuromodulation research and technology at Medtronic. What was missing was a way to validate these findings in real-world settings: in people's homes and workplaces over a long period of time. Researchers needed a big trial.

Any Medtronic DBS implant manufactured after 2020 has the ability to be switched into adaptive stimulation mode. If people were enrolled in a clinical trial after 2020, their implant's experimental capabilities could be activated by a firmware update, “a software unlock, like your iPhone”, says Raike. This approach opened up a large pool of possible trial participants. And the capability could be turned back off at the end of the trial.

After two months with continuous DBS, Bronte-Stewart unlocked Krehbiel's device. It continued to keep his tremor at bay. He needed fewer drugs.

Other trial volunteers have reported similar improvements, along with a reduction of symptoms associated with continuous stimulation. Although she is not permitted to discuss the results, which are still pending publication, Bronte-Stewart points to data presented at a 2024 conference9. Of 45 volunteers in the trial who were given the choice to revert to the continuous DBS or to retain the new adaptive functionality for a further long-term follow-up, 44 chose to stay on aDBS, Krehbiel among them. “I would not have considered for more than 30 seconds reverting back,” he says. “I was feeling good and didn't much care why.”

Beudel saw a broadly similar trend among his participants. “It's no secret that the results were positive,” he says. “We now see patients from all over the country coming to our centre saying that they want the aDBS.”

Since the new system was approved earlier this year, the upgrade has been available to anyone with one of the post-2020 devices. Beyond straightforward symptom relief, these users might see beneficial effects that go beyond controlling motor symptoms.

For example, Parkinson's disease notoriously interferes with sleep, and as the medicine wears off at night, problems emerge that range from insomnia to hallucinations. Sleep deprivation, in turn, worsens the symptoms. “It is a vicious circle,” says Beudel.

Adaptive DBS could reduce sleep disturbances by automatically adjusting to the sleep-induced changes in β-oscillations.

And better sleep might, in turn, protect the brain. If it does, says Denison, aDBS could shed light on the tantalizing but controversial hypothesis that DBS protects the brain when implanted earlier in Parkinson's disease progression.

Cancer deaths linked to obesity have tripled in the United States over the past two decades, according to a study being presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The study, which examined more than 33,000 deaths from obesity-associated cancers, revealed sharp increases in cancer deaths, especially among women, older adults, Native Americans and Black Americans.

"Obesity is a significant risk factor for multiple cancers, contributing to significant mortality," said lead researcher Faizan Ahmed, M.D., of Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune City, N.J. "This research underscores the need for targeted public health strategies such as early screening and improved access to care, especially in high-risk rural and underserved areas."

Obesity is a common condition. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 40.3% of adults have obesity. Obesity is a complex disease resulting from multiple genetic, physiological, hormonal, environmental and developmental factors.

In addition to certain types of cancer, obesity raises the risk of developing serious chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and chronic and end-stage kidney disease.

Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing 13 types of cancer, according to the CDC. These cancers make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year.

They are:

Faizan used mortality data from the CDC to analyze 33,572 U.S. deaths from obesity-associated cancers between 1999 and 2020. He found age-adjusted mortality rates increased from 3.73 to 13.52 per million over two decades, with steep increases among women, older adults, Black people, Native Americans and rural populations.

Regionally, the Midwest had the highest rate of obesity-related cancer deaths, while the Northeast had the lowest. State-level analysis revealed that Vermont, Minnesota and Oklahoma had the highest rates, while Utah, Alabama and Virginia had the lowest.

Consuming certain sweeteners commonly found in foods and beverages may increase the risk of early puberty in children, particularly among those who are genetically predisposed, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The researchers found that consuming aspartame, sucralose, glycyrrhizin and added sugars was significantly associated with a higher risk of early puberty, especially in children with certain genetic traits. The more of these sweeteners the teens consumed, the higher their risk of central precocious puberty.

"This study is one of the first to connect modern dietary habits -- specifically sweetener intake -- with both genetic factors and early puberty development in a large, real-world cohort," said Yang-Ching Chen, M.D., Ph.D., of Taipei Municipal Wan Fang Hospital and Taipei Medical University in Taipei, Taiwan. "It also highlights gender differences in how sweeteners affect boys and girls, adding an important layer to our understanding of individualized health risks."

A type of early puberty known as central precocious puberty is increasingly common. It can lead to emotional distress, shorter adult height, and increased risk of future metabolic and reproductive disorders.

Chen's previous research found that certain sweeteners can directly influence hormones and gut bacteria linked to early puberty. For example, one artificial sweetener called acesulfame potassium or AceK was shown to trigger the release of puberty-related hormones by activating "sweet taste" pathways in brain cells and increasing stress-related molecules. Another sweetener, glycyrrhizin -- found in licorice -- was found to change the balance of gut bacteria and reduce the activity of genes involved in triggering puberty.

"This suggests that what children eat and drink, especially products with sweeteners, may have a surprising and powerful impact on their development," Chen said.

The new findings come from the Taiwan Pubertal Longitudinal Study (TPLS), begun in 2018. The study included data from 1,407 teens. Central precocious puberty was diagnosed in 481 teens. The researchers assessed teens' sweetener intake through validated questionnaires and testing of urine samples. Genetic predisposition was quantified using polygenic risk scores derived from 19 genes related to central precocious puberty. Early puberty was diagnosed based on medical exams, hormone levels and scans.

Sucralose consumption was linked to a higher risk of central precocious puberty in boys and consumption of glycyrrhizin, sucralose and added sugars was associated with a higher risk of central precocious puberty in girls.

"The findings are directly relevant to families, pediatricians and public health authorities," Chen said. "They suggest that screening for genetic risk and moderating sweetener intake could help prevent early puberty and its long-term health consequences. This could lead to new dietary guidelines or risk assessment tools for children, supporting healthier development."

Newly uncovered metadata reveals that nearly three minutes of footage were cut from what the US Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation described as “full raw” surveillance video from the only functioning camera near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead. The video was released last week as part of the Trump administration's commitment to fully investigate Epstein's 2019 death but instead has raised new questions about how the footage was edited and assembled.

WIRED previously reported that the video had been stitched together in Adobe Premiere Pro from two video files, contradicting the Justice Department's claim that it was “raw” footage. Now, further analysis shows that one of the source clips was approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds longer than the segment included in the final video, indicating that footage appears to have been trimmed before release. It's unclear what, if anything, the minutes cut from the first clip showed.

The nearly three-minute discrepancy may be related to the widely reported one-minute gap—between 11:58:58 pm and 12:00:00 am—that attorney general Pam Bondi has attributed to a nightly system reset. The metadata confirms that the first video file, which showed footage from August 9, 2019, continued for several minutes beyond what appears in the final version of the video and was trimmed to the 11:58:58 pm mark, right before the jump to midnight. The cut to the first clip doesn't necessarily mean that there is additional time unaccounted for—the second clip picks up at midnight, which suggests the two would overlap—nor does it prove that the missing minute was cut from the video.

The footage was released at a moment of political tension. Trump allies had spent months speculating about the disclosure of explosive new evidence about Epstein's death. But last week, the DOJ and FBI issued a memo stating that no “incriminating ‘client list'” exists and reaffirmed the government's long-standing conclusion that Epstein—whom the US government accused of committing conspiracy to sex traffic minors and sex trafficking minors—died by suicide. That announcement triggered immediate backlash from pro-Trump influencers and media figures, who essentially accused the administration of a cover-up.

In response to detailed questions about how the video was assembled, WIRED sent a request for comment to the Department of Justice at 7:40 am on Tuesday morning. Just two minutes later, Natalie Baldassarre, a public affairs officer for the DOJ, replied tersely: “Refer you to the FBI.” The FBI declined WIRED's request for comment.

On Friday, WIRED published an analysis of metadata embedded in the video, confirmed by independent video forensics experts, which indicates that the file was assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ's website, where it was presented as “raw” footage.

WIRED's initial analysis found that those saves took place over a 23-minute span; however, further analysis of additional metadata shows the file was actually edited and saved several times over a period of more than three and a half hours on May 23, 2025. Specifically, the file was created at 4:48 pm and last modified at 8:16 pm ET that day. The metadata also references “MJCOLE~1,” which is likely a shortened version of a longer username. While it likely begins with “MJCOLE,” the full name cannot be determined from the metadata alone.

Both analyses found that the two clips, labeled “2025-05-22 16-35-21.mp4” and “2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4,” were stitched together. The first clip is 4 hours, 19 minutes, and 16 seconds long, but only the first 4 hours, 16 minutes, and 23.368 seconds appears in the published version, meaning nearly 2 minutes and 53 seconds were cut from the end. According to the metadata, the cut occurs just at 11:58:58 pm. The cut is milliseconds before the one-minute recording gap that Bondi said was caused by a quirk of the surveillance system. The second clip, “2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4,” picks up immediately afterward, continuing the footage from 12:00:00 am until 6:40:00 am.

WIRED reviewed its findings with two independent video forensics experts, each with over 15 years of experience in Premiere and video production, who confirmed that the edit occurred just before the missing minute mark and that approximately three minutes of footage were cut from the original clip.

The FBI released both “raw” and enhanced versions of the video. Both versions include internal comment markers, annotations typically used in editing software to flag moments of interest. The enhanced version, which the FBI referred to as Video 2, contains 15 such markers that apparently correspond to visible movement near “46 door” at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). This door is near the cell block where Epstein was being held while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. These markers appear to have been left by analysts during their review, but they do not include the original comment text.

According to a 2023 report by the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General (OIG), only two cameras in the vicinity of the Special Housing Unit (SHU), the area of the MCC where Epstein was held, were filming and recording at the time of his death. According to the report, the camera that recorded the footage the DOJ released July 7 captured video of a large portion of the SHU common area and parts of the stairways leading to various “tiers,” one of which housed Epstein's cell.

The OIG report notes that the MCC's surveillance system was outdated at the time of Epstein's death, “had not been properly maintained,” and that the DVR hard drives that stored the video files “frequently malfunctioned and needed to be replaced.”

Both the 2023 OIG report and the DOJ-FBI memo published last week state that anyone entering or attempting to access the tier containing Epstein's cell from the SHU common area on August 9 or 10, 2019, would have been visible on that camera. However, Epstein's cell door itself was not within the camera's field of view. The stairway leading to the tier where he was held was also partially obstructed and difficult to see clearly on the video. (A second camera, which covered the “ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor's four elevators,” was also filming at the time, according to the OIG report.)

Amid backlash from supporters and critics alike, President Donald Trump defended Bondi on Saturday, saying she was doing a “fantastic job.”

“What's going on with my ‘boys' and, in some cases, ‘gals?' They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.”

Palmer Luckey, cofounder of the weapons manufacturer Anduril, along with firms connected to Palantir cofounders Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, are investing in a new bank that is aiming to fill a gap left by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse two years ago. The venture is expected to be backed by upwards of $250 million in funding from Luckey, Lonsdale's venture firm 8VC, Thiel's Founders Fund, crypto-focused VC Haun Ventures, and several angel investors whose identities are not yet publicly known.

Like Anduril and Palantir, Erebor Bank is named after a term coined by J.R.R. Tolkien. (Introduced in The Hobbit, it's the name of a mountain where the murderous dragon Smaug hoards gold and jewels.) The bank's organizers and backers have remained tight-lipped about their vision. But their national bank charter application filed in June with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as well as interviews with more than a dozen industry sources, suggest the organizers are leveraging current regulatory openness in banking, as well as their political power, to build a crypto-focused Silicon Valley Bank successor made in their image.

The leadership team named in Erebor's application includes Michael Hagedorn, an experienced bank executive who will serve as Erebor's president; Trevor Capozza, head of operations at Palmer Luckey's family office; and co-CEOs Owen Rapaport, cofounder of crypto compliance platform Aer Compliance, and Jacob Hirshman, who has served in regulatory and advisory roles at the stablecoin provider Circle. Erin Gleason, chief communications officer of Founders Fund, told WIRED that Thiel was “not involved” in the deal and that Founders Fund invested $1 million into Erebor. Luckey and Lonsdale are not named in the nonconfidential sections of Erebor's filings; the application notes that major shareholders will not be involved in day-to-day operations.

Luckey, 8VC, Erebor's organizers, and their attorney, Adam Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment.

Erebor's intended client base is similar to that of Silicon Valley Bank, which served as the go-to business-banking partner for the San Francisco Bay Area tech industry and its affiliates. (SVB famously collapsed in March 2023 after economic volatility and risky liquidity practices led to a run on the bank. First Citizens Bank purchased SVB after the collapse; it now operates as a subsidiary.) The proposed bank states in its OCC filing that its customers would include startups in industries like crypto, AI, and defense, as well as wealthy and ultrawealthy consumers working in these fields. It also plans to assist foreign banks with some dollar-based activities. Erebor claims its target business clients are currently “not well served by either traditional or disruptive financial institutions, in particular with respect to insufficient access to credit” and says it will maintain a conservative balance sheet to account for the risks of “having a loan portfolio focused on frontier industries.”

Erebor also has crypto aspirations, including becoming “the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions” and facilitating “broader acceptance of stablecoins.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a currency or traditionally less-volatile commodity; they are often backed by cash or instruments like treasury bills with the aim of maintaining a consistent value. The bank additionally says it would accept cryptocurrencies as collateral for some loans.

Erebor is part of a growing wave of corporations applying for bank charters following Donald Trump's return to the White House. Regulators appointed by Trump have expressed an interest in reviewing new entrants with an “open mind.”

“The OCC is being very friendly to new applicants,” says Michele Alt, a regulatory consultant who previously worked in the OCC's Law Department. Alt says she believes that, under Trump, the OCC is trying to accelerate the review process for new banks, and applicants may see approvals within four to six months of filing, down from the current year-plus waiting period. (An OCC spokesperson said the agency "does not comment on pending licensing applications or specific financial institutions" in response to a request for comment by WIRED.)

The Trump administration has also reversed several Biden-era rules that limited banks from using stablecoins for payments and holding dollar reserves for stablecoin providers, opening the floodgates for financial institutions to launch stablecoin-based payment systems and serve stablecoin companies as clients. In March, for example, Rodney Hood, then-acting head of the OCC, overturned a Biden-era directive that had compelled banks to prove that they had “controls in place to conduct [stablecoin] activity in a safe and sound manner” before using stablecoin products and services. The Trump family, meanwhile, launched its own Trump-branded stablecoin earlier this year.

Stablecoin advocates say the technology can be used to make real-time, cross-border payments more affordable. Some point to their use for remittances, or they laud stablecoins' ability to expand the power of the US dollar. Detractors argue that stablecoins effectively remove US dollars from circulation, weakening the power of the Fed to set and control monetary policy. Migrating to a digital system that has experienced crashes and is weakly regulated also raises fears of contagion, which could elevate risk and erode trust in financial systems.

Crypto companies Circle, Ripple, BitGo, and a subsidiary of Protego are all applying for banking charters; Coinbase is “actively considering” a charter application; and payments firm Wise has also filed with the OCC.

If approved by the OCC and other regulators, Erebor can accept deposits, make loans, and be eligible for Federal Reserve payment systems as well as FDIC insurance. (Circle, Protego, and Wise are applying for charters primarily for facilitating payments through federal systems.)

Some new charter applications reflect “the adoption of ‘pay to play' in a whole lot of areas that traditionally did not work that way,” says Todd Baker, a financial services executive and senior fellow at Columbia Business School and Columbia Law School. Luckey and Lonsdale have been outspoken supporters and funders of Donald Trump as well as successful government contractors.

That the cofounders of a weapons manufacturer and surveillance behemoth have set their sights on banking may raise some eyebrows. There are some statutes, such as the Bank Holding Company Act and Change of Bank Control Act, that aim to prevent commercial ventures and their owners from engaging in banking activities or exerting control over banks (with a few exceptions). At the same time, as an early adopter of blockchain-based cross-border payments technologies for defense and law-enforcement purposes, such as for paying assets overseas, Erebor may be considered useful by the US government as a clearing house for blockchain-based government activities, according to Kevin Lehtiniitty, an executive in stablecoin-based payments infrastructure who has counted US government agencies as clients.

"What I imagine is going on here is that should this become a new chartered bank … the bank would be providing this ‘cash in, obfuscated crypto out' type of a product that would allow these agencies to be able to make payments,” he says.

Anduril also knows how to sell to the US government, and Erebor can use some parts of Anduril's growth strategy, says Rory McDonald, a business school professor at the University of Virginia who has studied Anduril. In Anduril's case, Palmer Luckey and his cofounders started by targeting the US government's border-security technologies, identifying them as a “fringe” part of the defense market. They offered an “imperfect but good enough technological solution and then [rode] the wave of improvement in that technology,” McDonald tells WIRED.

High-risk startups in crypto, AI, and defense may be that fringe market for Erebor—especially crypto companies. Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank—both of which failed around the same time as SVB—had also aimed to corner the crypto business-banking market by offering crypto-focused services.

Stephen Marcus, cofounder and general partner of Riot Ventures, which invests in some of the industries Erebor intends to serve, says Erebor will soon have to speak publicly about its products and determine how it will “communicate the stability” to potential business clients. “At the end of the day, these companies need access to liquidity, and they can't afford to have their cash not accessible,” he says, noting the “notoriety of the investors and those that are booting it up might be helpful,” though they'll have to “earn” companies' trust outside the portfolio companies whose banking decisions they can influence more easily.

Granted, that assumes Erebor gets that far; for all the deregulation making charter approvals speedier and more likely, regulators may see Erebor's application as too unprecedented or systemically risky. According to Evey Guo, principal at lobbying firm and consulting group FS Vector (founded by the former chief compliance officer and general counsel of Circle), Erebor's “novel elements” may elicit “additional regulatory scrutiny and require particularly robust controls.” Another banking industry specialist said Erebor's “monocrop” client profile could also cause concern, as a lack of client diversity partially contributed to the bank collapses of 2023. Additionally, Baker, the senior fellow at Columbia, contends Erebor's conservative approach to lending relative to its balance sheet may impose hurdles, as regulators have rejected previous banking proposals that shied away from lending.

Michele Alt, the regulatory consultant, sees a potential clash between the crypto industry and incumbent banks, which are “two very powerful lobbies,” in the wake of these charter applications. Organizations like the American Bankers Association (ABA) and Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) may attempt to take legal action or otherwise object to some charter applications, as the ICBA has most recently in a letter to the OCC, "strongly" opposing the attempt by Protego's subsidiary to enter the space. The outcome for Erebor, as well as the slew of stablecoin banking ventures popping up, depends on incumbents' litigiousness and on the ability for banking regulators to function as arbiters upholding some integrity within a multitrillion-dollar banking system.

“We know that [regulators] have deprioritized certain areas consistent with the policies of the current administration, but I would say, if not the federal banking agencies, who will regulate these banks?” Alt says.

As publishers fret about decreased traffic from Google, the search giant has begun rolling out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google's search app on iOS and Android. Now, instead of seeing a headline from a major publication, users will see multiple news publishers' logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.

The app warns that these summaries are generated with AI, “which can make mistakes.”

The feature is not yet appearing for all news stories within the Google app. In tests, TechCrunch was able to view the AI summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S.

Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson confirmed this is not a test, but actually a U.S. launch. The feature will appear on iOS and Android in the U.S., with a focus on trending lifestyle topics like sports and entertainment. Google also noted the feature will make it easier for people to decide what pages they want to visit. 

In addition to the summaries, Google has been trying out other ways to present the news displayed in Discover. Though not flagged as powered by AI, some stories will include a set of bullet points below the headline or will be grouped with similar news.

For instance, a story about President Trump's Ukraine deal also included links to other stories about Trump's latest actions. Meanwhile, a story from The Washington Post about ICE was followed by bullet points that summarized the story's content. 

The update to the search app comes as a number of publishers have been experimenting with AI on their own sites, including The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, USA Today, and others. Startups, too, have gotten in on the action, as with Particle, a news reader that uses AI to not only summarize stories but also allow users to see different sides or ask follow-up questions to better understand the topic covered.

Despite these trials, there's significant concern in the publishing industry about how the shift to AI is impacting website traffic and referrals. With features like Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode, users no longer have to visit a website directly to get answers to their search queries — it can be summarized for them automatically or shared in a chatbot-style interface. Outside of Google, this same trend is seen across other AI apps, like ChatGPT or Perplexity.

Recently, Google tried to appease publishers with the launch of Offerwall, a feature that allows publishers to generate revenue beyond the more traffic-dependent options, like ads. With Offerwall, publishers who use Google Ad Manager can try out different methods to provide access to their content, like micropayments or having users take surveys, sign up for newsletters, watch ads, and more. 

But for many publishers, these tools are coming too late, as traffic is already in a steep decline.

A story by The Economist this week noted that worldwide search traffic fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, citing data from market intelligence company Similarweb.

Earlier data from the firm also found that the number of news searches on the web that result in no click-throughs to news websites had grown from 56% in May 2024, when AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% as of May 2025. Organic traffic also declined, dropping from over 2.3 billion visits at its peak in mid-2024 to fewer than 1.7 billion, it noted.

Amid this shift, Google Discover still remained a source for clicks, even as traffic from Google Search declined. But that may no longer be the case if the AI summaries roll out more broadly within the Google app. 

Updated after publication with Google's comment confirming it's a U.S. launch.

Generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok have exploded in popularity as AI becomes mainstream. These tools don't have the ability to make new scientific discoveries on their own, but billionaires are convinced that AI is on the cusp of doing just that. And the latest episode of the All-In podcast helps explain why these guys think AI is extremely close to revolutionizing scientific knowledge.

Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber who no longer works at the company, appeared on All-In to talk with hosts Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya about the future of technology. When the topic turned to AI, Kalanick discussed how he uses xAI's Grok, which went haywire last week, praising Adolf Hitler and advocating for a second Holocaust against Jews.

“I'll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I'll start to get to the edge of what's known in quantum physics and then I'm doing the equivalent of vibe coding, except it's vibe physics,” Kalanick explained. “And we're approaching what's known. And I'm trying to poke and see if there's breakthroughs to be had. And I've gotten pretty damn close to some interesting breakthroughs just doing that.”

The guys on the podcast only briefly addressed Grok's failures without getting into specifics about the MechaHitler debacle, and none of that stopped Kalanick from talking like Grok was this revolutionary tool that was so close to making scientific discoveries in revolutionary ways.

“I pinged Elon on at some point. I'm just like, dude, if I'm doing this and I'm super amateur hour physics enthusiast, like what about all those PhD students and postdocs that are super legit using this tool?” Kalanick said.

Kalanick suggested that what made this even more incredible was that he was using an earlier version of Grok before Grok 4 was released on Wednesday.

“And this is pre-Grok 4. Now with Grok 4, like, there's a lot of mistakes I was seeing Grok make that then I would correct, and we would talk about it. Grok 4 could be this place where breakthroughs are actually happening, new breakthroughs,” Kalanick said.

Calacanis asked Kalanick the obvious question of whether Grok was actually on the verge of a scientific breakthrough. Because anyone who actually understands large language models knows that it can't achieve new ways of thinking. It's just putting together words in the most statistically likely way, forming connections that may sound like a well-thought-out argument but are actually not a form of true “intelligence” as humans would define it.

“Is your perception that the LLMs are actually starting to get to the reasoning level, that they'll come up with a novel concept theory and have that breakthrough? Or that we're kind of reading into it and it's just trying random stuff at the margins?” Calacanis asked.

Kalanick said that he hasn't used Grok 4 because he was having technical difficulties accessing it, suggesting that perhaps a later version of Grok might be capable of such a thing. But he admitted the AI couldn't yet come up with new discoveries.

“No, it cannot come up with the new idea. These things are so wedded to what is known. And they're so like, even when I come up with a new idea, I have to really, it's like pulling a donkey. You see, you're pulling it because it doesn't want to break conventional wisdom. It's like really adhering to conventional wisdom. You're pulling it out and then eventually goes, oh, shit, you got something,” Kalanick said.

Kalanick emphasized that “you have to double and triple check to make sure that you really got something,” making clear he understood that AI chatbots just make things up much of the time. But he still seemed convinced that the thing holding back Grok was “conventional wisdom” rather than the natural limitations of the tech.

Palihapitiya went a step further than Kalanick, insisting that synthetic data could train new AI models.

“When these models are fully divorced from having to learn on the known world and instead can just learn synthetically, then everything gets flipped upside down to what is the best hypothesis you have or what is the best question? You could just give it some problem and it would just figure it out,” said Palihapitiya.

Musk revealed a similar line of thinking recently when he suggested “general artificial intelligence” was close because he had asked Grok “about materials science that are not in any books or on the Internet.” The idea, of course, is that Musk had hit the limits of known science rather than the limit of his scientific understanding. The billionaire really seems convinced that Grok was working on something new.

That was how I felt when asking Grok 4 questions about materials science that are not in any books or on the Internet https://t.co/2wEP3mtD2j

These guys are hyping up the idea of general artificial intelligence (AGI), which doesn't even have an exact definition. But it's far from the only term getting tossed around right now. AI folks also drop words like “superintelligence” without defining what that means, but it sure keeps the investors intrigued.

These AI chatbots are pulling off a magic trick. They can often seem like they're “thinking” or applying rational thought to a given answer, but they work by spitting out the word that's most likely to be next in a sentence, not by actually applying critical reasoning. There's a reason that people who understand AI the best are the least excited about using it.

Apple has gotten a lot of shit for not committing to AI in a more forceful way, something the All-In guys talked about, but the company understands perhaps better than most that there are limitations to this tech. In fact, Apple released a paper last month that shows how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) struggle, facing “a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities.”

Apple's paper won't dampen the hype, of course. Just about every other major tech company is pushing hard into AI agents and investing billions of dollars into data centers. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Monday that his company was building enormous new data centers to work on superintelligence.

“Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher,” Zuck wrote. “I'm looking forward to working with the top researchers to advance the frontier!”

There's reportedly a potential new player in AR glasses, and you'll never guess who it is. I'll give you a hint: they make the app you're about to unconsciously check in about 15 seconds. No, not Tinder; get your mind out of the gutter. I'm talking about TikTok, or more specifically, ByteDance, which owns TikTok and also, according to The Information, which cites sources within the company, has aspirations of entering the burgeoning world of XR hardware. ByteDance's entrant, according to the report, is a pair of goggle-like AR glasses that sit somewhere in between Meta's Quest and Apple's Vision Pro, and I have to say… they sound kind of cool?

According to The Information, the AR goggles, codenamed Phoenix, will have digital passthrough, which is to say, they'll have XR similar to what you might see on a Quest 3, and they'll weigh just 100 grams. That is notably much lighter than the Vision Pro and Meta's Quest 3, which weigh 650 grams and 515 grams, respectively. That smaller form factor will definitely come with some limitations, though. Reducing the weight is all well and good, but it's still hard to miniaturize some of the high-end tech found in headsets like Vision Pro—I can't say for sure, but I wouldn't expect any high-res micro-OLED display here.

That being said, the report says that Phoenix will still borrow some of the capabilities from more premium headsets like the Vision Pro, including a UI that's centered around hand and eye-tracking instead of controllers, just like Apple's visionOS that powers the Vision Pro. While The Information doesn't say anything about price, I'm going to assume that Phoenix, if it ever sees the light of day, will be much cheaper than the Vision Pro, though that's not saying much since Apple's only headset—sorry, “spatial computer”—is still a conversation-ending $3,500. And that last part, if it does pan out to be true, will be very important.

If the report is correct, what we're looking at here is a lightweight AR headset that, yes, may be a little bit dumber than the rest of the pack, but is also a lot more accessible both weight-wise and monetarily. That's basically Meta's playbook with the Quest 3S, which costs just $299 and still does pretty much all of the things you'd want an XR headset to do, just not at a fancy-schmancy Vision Pro level. That lower capability but accessible price and weight strategy has been a fruitful one for Meta. In the first three quarters after its release, Meta sold 3 million Quest 3s while Apple sold just an estimated 370,000 Vision Pros.

And that's not the only Meta product to succeed with that strategy. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, for example, are shells of what competitors like Xreal are putting out—they don't even have displays in them—but they've resonated with people who want something affordable, lightweight, and with just enough features to make the price feel worthwhile. Oh, they also don't make you look like a total dork when you wear them. XR is still a nascent field at the end of the day, so it's too early to prognosticate on whether ByteDance's Phoenix glasses will be any good or anywhere close to successful. As a reality check, ByteDance notably owns the company Pico, which makes VR hardware that has yet to really challenge Meta's Quest dominance. That being said, this is a new product, and ByteDance may nail the strategy with Phoenix. Plus, with TikTok-level resources, it's hard to count anyone out.

Security researchers warn of persistent firmware threats affecting hundreds of models.

Firmware security research company Binarly has discovered four new vulnerabilities affecting the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) on multiple Gigabyte motherboards. The vulnerabilities with CVE identifiers CVE-2025-7029, CVE-2025-7028, CVE-2025-7027, and CVE-2025-7026 were shared with Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) for further analysis.

The cause of concern is said to lie within the System Management Mode (SMM), a high-privilege operating mode on x86 processors meant for low-level system management tasks. SMM grants UEFI access to the system hardware, where all the code is executed in a secure memory area called System Management RAM (SMRAM). This memory can only be accessed using Special System Management Interrupt (SMI) handlers, which rely on specific communication buffers to process data. However, in case these handlers do not validate the data, it can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code before the operating system is loaded.

CVE-2025-7026

Unchecked RBX register allows arbitrary SMRAM writes in CommandRcx0

8.2

High

As per CERT's report, an attacker with administrative access could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code in SMM and bypass key UEFI protections, including Secure Boot. The attacker can also install "stealthy firmware implants" and take long-term control of the system. These attacks can be triggered from inside the OS or during early boot, sleep, or recovery states. Since SMM operates below the OS kernel, it can be hard to spot or disable the vulnerability using traditional security tools.

Gigabyte is already rolling out firmware updates for many of the affected models. As per the latest security advisory, the company has shared a list of impacted products and corresponding BIOS versions, which includes a large number of Gigabyte motherboard models across the Intel 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 series platforms.

Binarly has confirmed to Bleeping Computers that over a hundred product lines are potentially at risk, including various revisions and region-specific models. Users are encouraged to visit Gigabyte's official support page to identify their motherboard model and download the latest BIOS/UEFI firmware. The update can be installed via Gigabyte's BIOS or using the Q-Flash utility. It is also critical to double-check the BIOS settings after updating to the latest firmware to ensure Secure Boot is enabled. While there's currently no evidence whether these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, the discovery throws light on the growing threat of firmware-level attacks.

Joseph Rutakanga spent eight years looking for tools to help companies gather consumer insight data. Eventually, he decided to just build them. 

Now his startup, called Rwazi, has raised a $12 million Series A led by Bonfire Ventures to help companies with market intelligence and consumer insights. He founded the company in 2021 with co-founder Eric Sewankambo. 

“There was an abundance of consumer and market-level data for places like the U.S., UK, and a few parts of Western Europe, maybe some traces in Canada and Australia. But when it came to international markets, including economic giants like India, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Turkey, and China, there was nothing usable,” he told TechCrunch. “No real picture on consumption, what consumers wanted, or how their behavior was shifting.” 

At first, he thought to solve the issue by purchasing statistics from government trade agencies. But eventually, he found that data to be outdated, fragmented, or sometimes simply nonexistent. He then turned to buying consumer reports and found them often inaccurate or hard to prove. 

“The solution wasn't surveys. It wasn't panels. It was what we now call zero-party data; consumption data that's voluntarily shared by the consumer, within their own routines, captured using advanced validation and verification systems, across any location, in real time,” Rutakangwa said. 

The pair via their startup, ended up building an AI-powered intelligence software system that lets businesses have real-time visibility into their consumer markets. It helps predict consumer behavior and identify important areas to pay attention to, which, in turn, can help reduce the cost of customer acquisition and boost customer loyalty. Rwazi customers include top consumer companies such as Coca-Cola, Pampers, Visa, and Nestle, per Rwazi's website. 

The company previously raised a $4 million seed round in 2022, also led by Bonfire Ventures. 

Rutakangwa described the fundraising process this time around as “selective,” saying he and Sewankambo focused on “finding the right partners, those who deeply understood the problem.” Other investors in this round include Santa Barbara Ventures, Newfund, and Alumni Ventures. 

Rwazi said it will use the fresh capital to scale its AI co-pilot to help its clients make more accurate real-time decisions. It also hopes to hire more engineers. It currently pulls data from 190 countries, with customers primarily in the U.S. and Europe. The goal, as Rutakangwa said, is to continue building infrastructure that captures the evolving world of consumer data. 

Rwazi does have competition,n including from legacy consumer insights companies GFK and Ipsos. But Rutakangwa said Rwazi is different from its competitors because it doesn't rely on modeled or inferred data. Instead, its own infrastructure allows for insight and execution; knowing what to do and what to do about it, he continued. 

“Winning today means anticipating shifts, seeing around corners, and making confident moves before the competition even senses a change,” he said.

It's been a very busy week for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. After meeting with President Donald Trump and senior officials in Beijing in recent days, Huang has secured a major victory for his AI-chip empire.

On Monday, Nvidia announced that the U.S. government will allow it to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The company still needs to secure official licensing approval from the Trump administration, but officials have reportedly assured Nvidia “that licenses will be granted.” The company said in a blog post that it's already filing the necessary applications and plans to begin shipments soon.

The H20 chip is a dialed-down version of Nvidia's powerhouse H100 semiconductor, built specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions. Nvidia is still banned from selling its most advanced chips to China due to national security concerns. The restrictions are also part of a broader effort to maintain America's edge in AI.

Back in April, those curbs tightened even more. After the unexpected success of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, the U.S. halted exports of the modified H20 chips, costing Nvidia potentially billions of dollars in sales. 

But now, it appears all but certain that Huang has managed to convince Trump that selling to China is actually a win for America. According to the company, during Huang's meeting with Trump and other U.S. policymakers, he reaffirmed “NVIDIA's support for the Administration's effort to create jobs, strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and onshore manufacturing, and ensure that America leads in AI worldwide.”

Huang has also made the case that if the future is AI, it's better that it runs on American hardware. 

“General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation,” Huang told reporters in D.C. “We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.”  

This news comes just days after Nvidia made history, becoming the first company ever to reach a $4 trillion market cap. 

Founded in 1993, Nvidia's chips were mostly known for decades for their use in gaming and computer graphics; however, they have now become the backbone in some major tech advances including AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

These victories have also paid off personally for Huang, who is now the eighth-richest person in the world. His fortune has already surpassed that of old-school business titan Warren Buffett and is just $1 billion shy of catching up to internet pioneer Sergey Brin.

Apple is investing $500 million in MP Materials, the only fully integrated rare earth mining company currently operating in the United States, as part of a broader effort to strengthen the domestic rare earth supply chain. 

The tech giant announced on Tuesday that with this deal, it's committed to buying American-made rare earth magnets developed at MP Materials' flagship facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The factory will develop a series of neodymium magnet manufacturing lines specifically designed for Apple products.

Apple says that once the American-made magnets are built, they will be shipped across the country and all over the world to help address increasing global demand for the material. 

The two companies will also collaborate to establish a rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. The facility will allow MP Materials to process recycled rare earth feedstock, including materials from used electronics and post-industrial scrap, and reuse it in Apple products.

In addition, the companies will work together to develop novel magnet materials and processing technologies to enhance magnet performance.

Apple says the commitment announced on Tuesday is part of its pledge to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. 

The tech giant first used recycled rare earth elements in the Taptic Engine of iPhone 11 in 2019. Today, almost all magnets across its devices are made with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements.

A DOGE staffer with access to the private information on millions of Americans held by the U.S. government reportedly exposed a private API key used for interacting with Elon Musk's xAI chatbot.

Independent security journalist Brian Krebs reports that Marko Elez, a special government employee who in recent months has worked on sensitive systems at the U.S. Treasury, the Social Security Administration, and Homeland Security, recently published code to his GitHub containing the private key. The key allowed access to dozens of models developed by xAI, including Grok.

Philippe Caturegli, founder of consultancy firm Seralys, alerted Elez to the leak earlier this week. Elez removed the key from his GitHub but the key itself was not revoked, allowing continued access to the AI models.

“If a developer can't keep an API key private, it raises questions about how they're handling far more sensitive government information behind closed doors,” Caturegli told KrebsOnSecurity.

How do you bury a controversy? If you're Elon Musk, you drop an anime waifu into the middle of a scandal and watch the internet do the rest. Just days after xAI's chatbot Grok sparked outrage for spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric and praising Adolf Hitler, the billionaire shifted the narrative by unveiling a new feature called Companions, which lets users interact with flirty, customizable AI avatars like Ani, a goth anime girl, and Rudy, a red panda. The feature went instantly viral.

While xAI has apologized for Grok's previous behavior, the backlash hadn't fully died down. The timing of this release was telling, and effective. Musk replaced the headlines about Grok's racism with something the internet could meme, argue over, and obsess about. Within 48 hours, the Companions announcement racked up nearly 30 million views on X (formerly Twitter).

The new Companion feature is part of a broader strategic pivot by Musk. While OpenAI and Meta race to make the most powerful language models, xAI is going after emotional engagement.

He hinted that users may soon be able to create their own digital companions with customized voices, appearances, and personalities. “We will make this easier to turn on in a few days,” the CEO of Tesla and founder of xAI and SpaceX said in another post. “Just wanted to do a soft launch to make sure things are stable and working well.”

This marks a shift in the AI wars. Instead of just competing on intelligence or reasoning, Musk wants Grok to feel more personal, more addictive, and more human, or at least more fun. But the reactions online show that people are split.

Musk's most devoted fans (and a likely horde of reply-bots) celebrated the new feature like a tech revelation. “She sounds awesome,” one user replied under the announcement post.

“Currently subscribed to a ton of AI tools: Grok, Claude, Manus, Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, and GitHub Copilot,” another added. “But after putting them all through the wringer, I'm about to hit ‘cancel' on most. I'm keeping Grok – it's smarter, funnier, and way less drama.”

“Cooler than anything,” said a third. “How can I marry Ani?” asked another.

But critics were quick to point out the potential risks, especially for young men.

“This is not going to help the birth rate,” one user warned. “Elon pls no, the birth rate,” echoed another.

Elon pls no, the birthrate

— Reddit Lies (@reddit_lies) July 14, 2025



Musk himself has long voiced concern about declining birth rates in developed countries. Ironically, his own product may now be feeding the problem. When someone replied “gg birthrates,” Musk responded: “Or maybe they get better.”

Or maybe they get better

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 14, 2025



The Companion feature is clearly inspired by waifu culture, a subgenre of anime fandom where fans form emotional or romantic bonds with fictional characters. It has real staying power online, but it's also controversial. Platforms like Replika and Character.ai have long enabled similar AI relationships, with some users reporting deep attachments or even addiction. Now, Musk is bringing that dynamic to a global stage, with meme virality and billionaire marketing power behind it.

And unlike most competitors, Grok Companions live inside X. That makes them not just personal assistants but viral agents of influence. They share memes. They flirt. They build parasocial bonds. And they feed engagement on Musk's struggling social media platform.

Move fast and build things.

Meta is accelerating its investment in the infrastructure it believes will be needed to power the future of artificial intelligence training and inference, with a number of high-capacity, fast-deployment data centers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined plans for gigantic, "multi-GW clusters" at truly gargantuan scale, and he's doing it extremely quickly by leveraging a number of cost and time-saving measures inspired by xAI. Meta is also building "tented" data centers, rather than traditionally roofed structures.

Deservedly, much has been said about the Meta's talent warsBut underrated is their extensive, vast, and fast moving infrastructure plan. They are moving fast like the early days but at 1000x the scaleSo fast that they are putting GPUs in tents Do you feel the AGI yet anon? https://t.co/Ayk347I4ey pic.twitter.com/TPLuyyrH3RJuly 12, 2025

Even if no one has quite made the AI business model profitable yet, that isn't stopping the world's largest tech companies from investing a collective hundreds of billions of dollars in powering the AI future they are so sure is coming. Alongside Nvidia pushing $500 billion global datacenter investment, and Elon Musk's xAI shipping a power station across the world, Meta is building a number of gigantic datacenters of its own. One of those will reportedly be as large as a sizeable portion of Manhattan.

Although its Llama models might not be capturing the AI zeitgeist like Meta hoped, it may soon be leading the way in domestic AI compute power. Earlier this month, Semi-Analysis reported that Meta will be the first company to build out and deploy a gigawatt-scale datacenter for AI. That will give it over three billion TFLOPS of compute power, we're told. And according to Mark Zuckerberg, this is just the beginning.



The 1GW "Prometheus" datacenter will come online in 2026, but Meta is also building "Hyperion," he said, which will take a few years to build up to scale and will eventually require as much as 5GW of power. Meta is also working on several other data centers in the longer term, and each of these "titan clusters" could be as large as a sizeable portion of Manhattan.



The self-styled "Zuck" went on to say that "Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher," which may hint at the business model Meta is targeting. If it can't build the AI itself, perhaps it could join Amazon and other entities, like Groq, in providing the infrastructure to power it.

That competition will mean Meta needs to scale up fast if it wants to be competitive, and that seems to be exactly what it's doing. Semi-Analysis detailed how Meta has reinvented its datacenter strategy about building them with AI in mind. Meta will reportedly use a new "tent" style of structure that is faster to build and has less redundancy to further increase the pace of deployment. Where traditional data centers have backup diesel generators should they encounter a power outage, the new Meta sites will do away with that entirely.

They will also leverage pre-fabricated power and cooling modules and will draw power from on-site meta substations, with smart workload management tools helping to maximize the power available to each datacenter. That can also include on-site natural gas generation, too, with Meta already building two 200MW natural gas plants in Ohio.

Joby Aviation has doubled the size and production capacity of its pilot manufacturing facility in Marina, California, as it races to commercialize eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles) by early next year. 

The now-435,500-square-foot facility will be able to produce 24 aircraft per year, and “nearly one” every other week once fully operational, according to Joby. The facility will also support federal certification, ground and flight testing, pilot training, and aircraft maintenance. 

TechCrunch has asked when Joby expects to produce vehicles at full capacity, as well as for updates on Joby's first scaled facility in Dayton, Ohio, which would build up to 500 aircraft per year once it's constructed  

Joby has enlisted engineers from its investor Toyota to help build both sites. Toyota in May closed the first, $250 million tranche of a previously announced $500 million investment into Joby.

The news of Joby's expanded pilot facility comes as the eVTOL company adds a sixth aircraft to its fleet. Joby says the aircraft earned its airworthiness certification within a week of completion.

Joby went public through a SPAC merger in 2021. The company plans to launch commercial operations first in Dubai in early 2026, and in a U.S. city afterwards.

"We were recently informed by the Department of Commerce that license applications to export MI308 products to China will be moving forward for review"

Just hours after Nvidia announced that the sale of H20 chips in China is set to be approved by Washington, AMD has now confirmed it also plans to resume shipments of its MI308 chips in the country, following a similar shift by the administration. The company confirmed to Tom's Hardware that its license applications to export the chip will be moving forward for review, with the implied understanding that they will be granted.

As noted, the news follows the revelation that Nvidia will resume the sale of its H20 chips in China. AMD says it was recently informed by the Department of Commerce that its license applications to export MI308 would be going ahead, and says it "plans to resume shipments as licenses are approved." In a statement, the company further noted, "We applaud the progress made by the Trump Administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership."

As with Nvidia, AMD has chafed under restrictions on AI hardware export restrictions put forward by both the previous Biden administration and the current Trump administration. The former introduced a blanket AI diffusion rule; the latter, while reversing AI diffusion, placed specific restrictions on the H20 and MI308 chips.

AMD confirmed at the time that the measures could cost it in the region of $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. While not quite the $5.5 billion write-off suffered by Nvidia, that's enough to hurt anyone's bottom line, making today's shift in policy a welcome break for Team Red.

AMD shares have surged by nearly 5% in pre-market trading following the news, a similar jump to Nvidia, as shareholders welcome the development.

The overturning of the specific bans on the H20 and MI308 chips marks a seismic policy shift within Washington, following months of protracted back-and-forth. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been a notable detractor of such measures, calling export control a failure and praising President Trump's move to roll back the AI diffusion rule. Huang has repeatedly stated that export controls could limit U.S. power in the advancing world of AI and force countries like China to look inward for innovation and alternative hardware solutions, possibly buoying the country's efforts rather than stalling them.

Most recently, he downplayed concerns that China's military could use U.S. AI tech and stated, "Just like we want the world to be built on the American dollar, using the American dollar as the global standard, we want the American tech stack to be the global standard." He reiterated that in order for America to have AI leadership," it needs to make sure the American tech stack is available to markets all over the world."

If you're in the bottle-washing phase of your life, you know what a task it is to sanitize them. Sure, hand washing the nooks and crannies of parts with a bottle brush is tedious, but the real toll is the precious time the chore takes away from your baby. And you don't know chapped hands until you've been wrist-deep in hot, soapy water multiple times a day.

Enter the baby bottle washer: A unicorn for new parents. Just plop in the dirty bottles, fill the water reservoir, and in less than two hours you have sparkling-clean, ready-to-go bottles. It's a game changer, and I've lost count of “well in my day …” comments I've received during the testing process of these miracle machines. The technology is pretty new, so there aren't a ton of options on the market. But here at WIRED, we're getting ahead of the curve and have tested every baby bottle washer available to see if the appliance is worth it.

Grownsy

Amazon

Grownsy

Having never heard of the Grownsy before I tried it, I was really impressed by this sterilizer. The interior cavity is deep, and the tray is wide enough to hold a variety of bottle and pump parts without issue. I had no trouble fitting everything from tall eight-ounce bottles to short, wide ones and pump flanges inside the machine.

The machine has four core modes—Quick Wash (19 minutes), Normal Wash (29 minutes), Sterilize and Dry, and Storage—customizable into nine combinations, so you can mix‑and‑match cycles to suit your schedule. After the cycle is done, the machine enters a 72-hour storage mode, circulating HEPA-filtered air to keep bottles sterile inside the chamber.

The Grownsy is surprisingly quiet—there are no rumbling sounds, just the subtle sounds of swishing water, which I find calming in a quiet house during nap time. The dirty water output is via a hose, so the device must be placed next to a sink to empty during the cycle. So if you're tight on space near your sink, this machine may not be for you. But if you've got the room, it's an efficient and reliable option, and it's less expensive than its competitors.

Baby Brezza

Kohl's

Baby Brezza

Target

I like to think of the Baby Brezza Bottle Washer Pro as the pioneer of bottle washers. It paved the way for what I think will be a booming baby product in the next few years, and the Brezza specifically is consistently a top seller across retailers, so it felt like a natural to try first.

The Brezza does what it promises. It washes and sterilizes well, and it uses less water than many competitors—great if you're working with limited filtered or purified water. Like most bottle washers I've tried, some pieces may still come out a little wet even after the dry cycle, but that's pretty standard.

With that said, this bottle washer comes with some trade-offs—the biggest being its size. Not only does it look (and sound) like a rocket ship on the counter, but you also need to take into consideration the clearance needed above the machine so that steam won't warp your cabinets. For something that takes up that much space, it's surprisingly particular about how you load it. The racks are fixed and shallow, which works fine for standard bottles, but wide bottles or pump flanges can feel cramped or tip over if you're not meticulous. And taking the lid off when it's full can be awkward; it's easy to knock things over if you're not careful.

If counter real estate is limited or you need flexibility for various bottle sizes and pump parts, it can be a bit picky, but if you're looking for a dependable, hands-off solution to bottle cleaning, the Baby Brezza is a solid pick.

Momcozy

Amazon

Walmart

Momcozy

The Momcozy KleanPal Pro Baby Bottle Washer is sleek and looks as good on a countertop as any hefty tabletop washing machine can. It comes in a clean, soft white with teal accents and blends into most kitchen decor. In terms of appearance—and even some facets of performance—the Momcozy and the Grownsy machines are strikingly similar, though a few subtle differences set them apart.

The analog on the front of the Momcozy bottle washer shows you how much time is left in the current mode it's running, rather than the whole cycle, which can be confusing if you're pressed for time and need clean bottles. The machine also has a rapid wash cycle option, which is a quick 19 minutes, but you can't pair Rapid Wash with Dry. To me, this kind of defeats the purpose of the quick-wash option; I'd probably just wash by hand if I needed bottles in a rush. But overall, the number of modes that the Momcozy can perform is more than the others.

From observation, the Momcozy's water jets don't seem as powerful as those of its competitors. The spray appears gentler, which is great for noise control but made me question its cleaning power. I occasionally noticed some residue on intricate bottle and pump parts, especially compared to the Brezza, which definitely sounds like it's working hard.

Can I Wash Other Baby Items in a Bottle Washer?

Yes. Check the instructions of the specific bottle washer you're using, but most machines can wash things like pacifiers, breast pump parts, and small toys and teethers, so long as the pieces are steam-resistant.

How Often Should I Clean a Baby Bottle Washer?

It's a good idea to give your baby bottle washer a good cleaning every one to two months, especially if you start to notice milk residue or hard water buildup.

How Do I Clean a Baby Bottle Washer?

Most manufacturers suggest running a cycle with a vinegar and water solution or a descaling product made for steam cleaners. Follow the instructions for your machine, and make sure to rinse all parts well afterward.

Do I Have to Use the Brand's Detergent Tablets?

As far as we know, yes. All bottle washing machines are calibrated for their own dissolvable tablets.

Can I Wash Glass Bottles in a Bottle Washer?

Yes. Just make sure the glass bottles are dishwasher-safe, and handle them carefully when loading and unloading, especially because glass will hold heat from the dryer. Also avoid sudden temperature swings (like moving an ice‑cold bottle straight into a hot cycle) to prevent cracking.

How Long Does a Typical Cleaning Cycle Take?

Cleaning times vary by machine and by which mode(s) you choose. Expect a cycle to take from 20 minutes for a quick wash to about 90 minutes for a full wash-sterilize-dry cycle.

How I Tested

I tested these bottle washing machines in my own kitchen as a new parent to a now 8-month-old, starting when my daughter was around 3 months. I tested each machine for at least a month, running two cleaning cycles a day early on when she was still taking bottles overnight. Now that she's sleeping through the night, we've settled into one full wash per day. I tested a variety of items—narrow and wide-neck bottles (both glass and plastic), breast pump parts, pacifiers, and teethers—to see how each machine handled different shapes, materials, and levels of breast-milk and formula residue.

Snazzy Labs' Quinn Nelson has fallen foul of Nintendo's aggressive anti-piracy measures 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Switch 2 owner has had their console “restricted by Nintendo” after installing a Switch game they bought on the used market. Quinn Nelson, the creator behind popular YouTube channel Snazzy Labs, fell foul to the long arm of Nintendo law, and now assumes the “old copy of Bayo 3 on eBay” they bought must have been dumped/ripped by its previous owner and got flagged by big N's anti-piracy servers.

PSA: be EXTREMELY careful buying used Nintendo Switch games. Bought an old copy of Bayo 3 on eBay and WELP, my 1-month-old $450 Switch 2 is BANNED.This cart must have been dumped by whoever owned it before me.Hoping Nintendo will understand/unlock for me, else, this SUCKS! pic.twitter.com/ev0VXNVQU6July 15, 2025

Nelson kindly posted the above warning as a PSA (public service announcement) for other Switch 2 owners who may be considering building their game library via the used market. “Be EXTREMELY careful buying used Nintendo Switch games,” they stress. Nintendo's action, represented by the screen, doesn't just disable access to the possibly duped and redistributed copy of Bayo 3. All access to Nintendo's online services have been cut off.

The above foreboding message effectively signals a ban on the particular console from online services operated by Nintendo. The move isn't tied to the user account, but Nelson's “1-month-old $450 Switch 2 is BANNED” from a lot of the online fun available. To be clear, if this happens to you, the physical cartridges that you own will remain playable, without updates, and some previously downloaded digital games may remain accessible.

Other social media users were quick to reassure Nelson of two things. Firstly, hardware bans received for using second-hand game carts that have been cloned by tools like MIG Flash are not uncommon. And, probably more importantly, Nintendo is receptive to owners who can provide corroborating evidence that they are innocent of Nintendo-flavored piracy. We reported on exactly such a case, only last week, with a happy ending for the innocent Facebook Marketplace-sourced used-game buyer.

All that seems to be required to iron out this digital wrinkle is some online correspondence with Nintendo and some kind of paper trail (or screenshots) showing that the offending game cart was bought used without any awareness of bad provenance.

Not all social media responses to Nelson's situation were supportive, though – this is X in 2025., afterall A particular point was raised by Centro LEAKS, a Pokémon leaks, rumors and news site, which highlighted Nelson's previous posts, one mentioning that he intended to run “my MIG Flash game dumps” on the Switch 2.

Hope my Switch 2 continues to work with my MIG Flash game dumps. This is the best way to carry all of your physical games all at once without risking a ban on an unmodded console. pic.twitter.com/dTl711noeJApril 5, 2025

Nelson clarified in that referenced Tweet that he used the flash cart to vastly improve the portability of a large game collection. Moreover, he informed commentators and critics at the time that "You get banned if you play pirated copies. Not your own," implying he doesn't think the ban is related to this activity.

Taking Nelson's claims at face value, let's hope they get their Switch 2 back online shortly. Having an almost new console restricted and locked down like this, while being innocent of any piracy, would definitely not be fair.

The H20 taps are open once again.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The White House plans to allow Nvidia to sell its H20 AI GPUs to China once again, signaling a significant victory for the company after it suffered a $5.5-billion write-off when they were banned for export to China in mid-April. The company confirmed to Tom's Hardware that “The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.”

The company announced the China-specific H20 AI GPUs in late 2023 after Washington banned its most advanced H100 and H200 models for export to China. However, the Biden Administration's AI diffusion rule, and then more targeted measures from the Trump administration, threatened to ban even these defanged GPUs, which were still quite popular among Chinese customers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly spent $1 million on a dinner with the president to have the plan suspended, but the White House banned their export a week later anyway, a measure affecting both the Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 AI chips.

Jensen Huang has been vocal against the ban that the U.S. is placing on advanced AI chips, an area dominated by his company. The CEO has said many times that AI chip export control is a failure and that the Chinese military will avoid American tech for its development. Instead of limiting who has access to its technology, he says that it should do the opposite and allow American AI tech to spread far and wide — or else it risks losing the lead to its Chinese competitors like Huawei.

H20 export license approvals resumed a month after the U.S. and China negotiated a preliminary trade deal amid prolonged tariff tensions. Some of the developments between the nations include the resumption of rare earth metal exports to the U.S. in exchange for the lifting of the EDA export control. Nvidia says that CEO Jensen Huang has been flying between Washington, D.C., and Beijing, meeting with officials and policymakers to emphasize “the benefits that AI will bring to business and society worldwide.” It seems that his lobbying between the two parties has been successful with this approval, although we won't know for sure until the licenses are officially granted. Nvidia will be hopeful it can resume H20 sales without a hitch.

We should note, though, that this doesn't appear to be a blanket lifting of the ban — instead, it's just a promise that Washington will start approving export licenses for the H20 GPU. It's likely for this reason that the company announced the fully compliant Nvidia RTX Pro GPU, which “is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics.” The company was also reportedly preparing a cut-down HGX H20 GPU in response to the original ban, which wouldn't have any sort of restriction placed on it.

People occasionally ask me if AI is coming for my job. I'm pretty hands-on, which gives me a bit of a feeling of security. But that feeling dropped a bit when I saw a robot with a knife in its gripper, testing its edge.

The robot is a side project from Seattle Ultrasonics, a tiny operation run by Scott Heimendinger, an alumni of Modernist Cuisine and Anova, and cofounder of the beloved Sansaire sous vide company. Before all that, he was at Microsoft, working on software that became Power Query and Power BI.

“I'm pretty ridiculously good at Excel,” Heimendinger says, referring to his time at Microsoft before pausing. “I'm very good. I was a whippersnapper.”

More recently, he's been working on creating an ultrasonic knife for home kitchens, due out later in 2025. It looks like a regular chef's knife, but it vibrates almost imperceptibly, allowing it to cut incredibly well.

The knives tested in Heimendinger's lab.

But it's Heimendinger's data-gathering side project, which he calls the Quantified Knife Project, that has grabbed my attention. For the experiment, he bought 21 chef's knives, attached them to a robot arm, ran them through a battery of tests, then crunched the gobs of data to calculate a "food cutting rank."

To do all of his testing, he did a weekday's worth of ingredient shopping, queued up the Real Genius soundtrack, and ran his robot arm hard over a full weekend to collect the data. Five different foods sliced five times each, times 21 knives. That's 525 individual robot cuts, from which Heimendinger accrued 100,000 data points for his rankings.

Dedicated knife nerds will be happy to know that he also ran each knife through a BESS sharpness test that measures the force needed to cut through a synthetic wire and sent the blades away for CATRA edge-retention tests. He then incorporated that data into the cutting rank.

I suppose I should have been scared, or even jealous, of what he and his robot arm were doing. But mostly, I was intrigued. There were things I was curious about, and while I might have made little modifications to the tests or chosen different knives, mostly it just felt exciting.

The Excel nerd now had reams of data. Spreadsheets galore! By crunching the data, he could rank the knives. I wanted to see for myself how he was testing, learn more about the knives he thought were best, compare our testing styles, and see how my favorite knife compared to his.

I put that favorite knife, a Glestain with enormous dimples, in my knife roll and went to visit Heimendinger at his downtown Seattle lab. There's a lot to take in in his tiny space: a drill press, 3-D printers, specialized photo and video gear, a tiny shop vac, optical and digital microscopes, his “crazy handy” oscilloscope. There's also the robot arm, a uFactory xArm 6, which he has dubbed Dr. J. Robot Choppenheimer.

You can move this "cobot,” or collaborative robot, around while it records the movements, then it will mimic those movements over and over again. "It means it knows how much force is being applied and can stop if too much resistance is being met," he says. In other words, if you've got the settings right, it won't chop through your table or your arm.

Scott took my knife, attached it to the robot's gripper, and started collecting data, running through the same battery of tests as his other 21 knives. First, it cut through five tomatoes, one at a time, through the equator. He mounts everything he's cutting to a 3-D printed plate with spikes that keep it from rolling or sliding away. That sits on a scale connected to his computer, allowing him to create a graph of how much force is being applied as the blade moves through the food. Tomatoes, for example, require a knife edge to exert a relatively large amount of pressure to break through the skin, then much less to complete the cut.

After the fifth tomato, I had to know how my knife did. Without judgment, Heimendinger announced that it placed "second to last in the cohort." I felt responsibility for this knife, and a little embarrassment, until I remembered his knives came straight out of the box and into the testing process with an unblemished factory edge. My knife, on the other hand, had been in regular use in my test kitchen for more than six months receiving only the occasional honing. Plus, I noted protectively that these tomatoes appeared bigger than the ones he used during his main battery of testing.

He continued through the other four foods: potatoes, cheese cubes, baby carrots, and King's Hawaiian rolls, the latter chosen for their extremely uniform interior.

A test knife slices through a piece of cheese.

Bread rolls were also used in the testing.

Understandably, my knife didn't fare particularly well, but I was able to get an appreciation for Scott's testing and data-gathering process.

Even with the robot, collecting this amount of data took a lot of time. Every piece of food needed to be loaded and unloaded from the scale, the knife wiped, cleaned, and dried after every stroke, the room kept cool, the whole thing happening during that monotonous bender of a weekend, Don Henley and Tears for Fears playing over and over.

Once he got all that data and made dozens and dozens of charts and graphs, what did he learn?

“How scattered the results are.”

Per his testing, three chef's knives were fairly blazingly fantastic, doing well across the board: a Shun Classic Hollow Edge, a Moritaka Hamono, and a Tojiro Professional. Number four was weird: The $300 Wüsthof Amici (very similar to their fantastic Classic but with a different bolster and handle) aced everything except the carrots, at which it was quite bad. The last two slots, 20 and 21, were also well secured, by a Henckels Classic and the $18 Zwilling Solution Fine Edge.

Yet the stuff in the middle—slots five to 19, more than two-thirds of the test group—were what he was referring to when he said “scattered,” performing well in one category and poorly in another.

"You would think that a great tomato knife would make a great potato knife," he said before noting that wasn't necessarily the case. "It's bananas."

Tomatoes are a real test of slicing ability.

Same with potatoes.

Those three knives at the top of his rankings feel like safe bets. I'd even feel pretty good about lumping that Wusthöf in there. And if I had been considering purchasing one of those two at the bottom of his list, I'd abandon the idea. But those 15 in the middle? What about them?

For his part, Scott appreciated their lack of predictability.

"Nobody's done this sort of evaluation. This might be the first time we're understanding that what matters for a tomato is different than what matters for a potato," he said. "When you get these kinds of answers in science, these are the most exciting."

So what is best for a tomato?

I thought he was going to generalize about blades, but instead he said the Wüsthof Amici, which, thanks to a particularly well-honed apex, just sliced right through.

"It's all about breaking the skin!"

To me, his testing and the way he chose to do each test leaves a fair amount of subjectivity to the whole thing. Then again, the way I test probably feels subjective to other reviewers. There's stuff in his criteria for everyone obsessed with knives and robot arms and databases, and there are other things that other testers would change.

If it were my test, I'd make Dr. Choppenheimer's tomato motion more of a slice. I'd use bigger hunks of cheese in the cheese test, I'd throw out bread as a criteria because I don't use my chef's knives as bread knives, and maybe I'd reposition the carrot to be closer to the heel of the knife where I usually cut them.

Something I'd want to feel more sure of are things this testing doesn't take into account. How comfortable is the handle? Is the top of the spine rounded where pinch-grip user would lay their index finger over it so they get blisters while chopping up a bag of onions? Is the blade tall enough so the fat fingered among us don't whack their knuckles on the cutting board? Is it weighted in a way you like? Some knives are center-weighted while others feel heavier toward the front of the blade or back in the handle; years ago I tested a Shun nakiri that was super weight forward, which, I learned, was not my jam. What you like about a knife is very personal.

If you don't take stuff like that into account, the possibility that you'll like your new knife is kinda up in the air. For Heimendinger, this is by design. He intentionally leaves out what he calls "objective and personal stuff."

I took my Glestain to a professional sharpener then, a few days later, brought it back to Heimendinger to run the tests again. I'd noticed his ability to be dispassionate about his wall of beautiful knives he'd amassed for testing, but I still I hoped he'd be interested, even excited about mine, with its monster dimples. But no. Mostly, it was just the 22nd knife he ran through its paces, though he did say "Nice! These will make for better numbers," when he ran it through the BESS tests.

As someone who wears his knife-sharpness pride on his sleeve, I was happy to see that the Glestain leapt into eighth place in his rankings after it had been sharpened.

Not that the two of us had staked out opposing positions on that first day in the lab, but I started appreciating how this data would make a nice addition to my kind of testing. He certainly understands the value of hands-on time with whatever blade you're researching. If you buy a knife that feels good and is backed up by his data, I dare say you'll be ready to slice and dice to your heart's content.

"There isn't just one test or one answer to how a knife performs. Hold one. See if it speaks to you. You could hold the worst performer and love it," he says. "I hope you are happy together."

New research shows models can be directly edited to hide selected voices, even when users specifically ask for them.

A technique known as “machine unlearning” could teach AI models to forget specific voices—an important step in stopping the rise of audio deepfakes, where someone's voice is copied to carry out fraud or scams.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have revolutionized the quality of text-to-speech technology so that people can convincingly re-create a piece of text in any voice, complete with natural speaking patterns and intonations, instead of having to settle for a robotic voice reading it out word by word. “Anyone's voice can be reproduced or copied with just a few seconds of their voice,” says Jong Hwan Ko, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea and the coauthor of a new paper that demonstrates one of the first applications of machine unlearning to speech generation.

Copied voices have been used in scams, disinformation, and harassment. Ko, who researches audio processing, and his collaborators wanted to prevent this kind of identity fraud. “People are starting to demand ways to opt out of the unknown generation of their voices without consent,” he says. 

There is a big elephant in the room: outright bans might not even be technically feasible.

AI companies generally keep a tight grip on their models to discourage misuse. For example, if you ask ChatGPT to give you someone's phone number or instructions for doing something illegal, it will likely just tell you it cannot help. However, as many examples over time have shown, clever prompt engineering or model fine-tuning can sometimes get these models to say things they otherwise wouldn't. The unwanted information may still be hiding somewhere inside the model so that it can be accessed with the right techniques. 

At present, companies tend to deal with this issue by applying guardrails; the idea is to check whether the prompts or the AI's responses contain disallowed material. Machine unlearning instead asks whether an AI can be made to forget a piece of information that the company doesn't want it to know. The technique takes a leaky model and the specific training data to be redacted and uses them to create a new model—essentially, a version of the original that never learned that piece of data. While machine unlearning has ties to older techniques in AI research, it's only in the past couple of years that it's been applied to large language models.

Jinju Kim, a master's student at Sungkyunkwan University who worked on the paper with Ko and others, sees guardrails as fences around the bad data put in place to keep people away from it. “You can't get through the fence, but some people will still try to go under the fence or over the fence,” says Kim. But unlearning, she says, attempts to remove the bad data altogether, so there is nothing behind the fence at all. 

The way current text-to-speech systems are designed complicates this a little more, though. These so-called “zero-shot” models use examples of people's speech to learn to re-create any voice, including those not in the training set—with enough data, it can be a good mimic when supplied with even a small sample of someone's voice. So “unlearning” means a model not only needs to “forget” voices it was trained on but also has to learn not to mimic specific voices it wasn't trained on. All the while, it still needs to perform well for other voices. 

To demonstrate how to get those results, Kim taught a recreation of VoiceBox, a speech generation model from Meta, that when it was prompted to produce a text sample in one of the voices to be redacted, it should instead respond with a random voice. To make these voices realistic, the model “teaches” itself using random voices of its own creation. 

According to the team's results, which are to be presented this week at the International Conference on Machine Learning, prompting the model to imitate a voice it has “unlearned” gives back a result that—according to state-of-the-art tools that measure voice similarity—mimics the forgotten voice more than 75% less effectively than the model did before. In practice, this makes the new voice unmistakably different. But the forgetfulness comes at a cost: The model is about 2.8% worse at mimicking permitted voices. While these percentages are a bit hard to interpret, the demo the researchers released online offers very convincing results, both for how well redacted speakers are forgotten and how well the rest are remembered. A sample from the demo is given below. 

Ko says the unlearning process can take “several days,” depending on how many speakers the researchers want the model to forget. Their method also requires an audio clip about five minutes long for each speaker whose voice is to be forgotten.

In machine unlearning, pieces of data are often replaced with randomness so that they can't be reverse-engineered back to the original. In this paper, the randomness for the forgotten speakers is very high—a sign, the authors claim, that they are truly forgotten by the model. 

 “I have seen people optimizing for randomness in other contexts,” says Vaidehi Patil, a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who researches machine unlearning. “This is one of the first works I've seen for speech.” Patil is organizing a machine unlearning workshop affiliated with the conference, and the voice unlearning research will also be presented there. 

She points out that unlearning itself involves inherent trade-offs between efficiency and forgetfulness because the process can take time, and can degrade the usability of the final model. “There's no free lunch. You have to compromise something,” she says.

Machine unlearning may still be at too early a stage for, say, Meta to introduce Ko and Kim's methods into VoiceBox. But there is likely to be industry interest. Patil is researching unlearning for Google DeepMind this summer, and while Meta did not respond with a comment, it has hesitated for a long time to release VoiceBox to the wider public because it is so vulnerable to misuse. 

The voice unlearning team seems optimistic that its work could someday get good enough for real-life deployment. “In real applications, we would need faster and more scalable solutions,” says Ko. “We are trying to find those.” 

We're starting to give AI agents real autonomy, and we're not prepared for what could happen next.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

Some people believe chatbots like ChatGPT can provide an affordable alternative to in-person psychedelic-assisted therapy. Many experts say it's a bad idea.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to a new gene therapy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) developed at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and licensed to the U.S. company Klotho Neurosciences, Inc.

The drug uses a viral vector of the AAV (adeno-associated virus) type that expresses the secreted isoform of Klotho (s-KL) protein, with neuroregenerating, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In order to reach the neuromuscular junctions affected by the ALS disease, the vector acts under the control of a DNA sequence that regulates the expression of the protein specifically in the muscle (a muscle-specific promoter), so that therapeutic activity is directed towards the neuromuscular junctions. This innovative approach has shown very promising results in the most widely used mouse model for the preclinical study of ALS, delaying the onset of the disease, preserving neuromuscular function and extending survival.

The technological development was led by UAB researchers, with the involvement of the CIBER, ICREA and Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, co-owners of the intellectual property relating to the use of the Klotho protein and licensed to Klotho Neurosciences -a start-up company based on knowledge generated at UAB and listed on Nasdaq in 2023 (NASDAQ: KLTO)-. The technology was developed by the research groups of Assumpció Bosch and Miquel Chillón, both from the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the UAB Institut de Neurociències (INc-UAB). The research project also included the collaboration of the group led by Professor Xavier Navarro, researcher at the Institut de Neurociències and the UAB Department of Cellular Biology, Physiology and Immunology, and expert in neuroregeneration and motor neuron diseases.

The orphan drug designation for the therapy we have developed acknowledges the relevance of treatments targeting muscle and neuromuscular junction as a strategy for ALS."

Assumpció Bosch, principal investigator of the study

"To date, we have been able to demonstrate efficacy in a leading animal model for this pathology. We are now testing it in other ALS models to confirm that this therapeutic solution can be applied to the widest possible number of patients", adds Sergi Verdés, postdoctoral researcher on the research team.

Receiving the orphan drug designation by the FDA underscores the potential of the treatment for the rare and severely disabling disease ALS, which affects around 65,000 people in Europe and for which there is no effective treatment. This recognition offers advantages such as seven years of exclusivity for the drug in the U.S. market, fee waivers and tax incentives for clinical trials.

Klotho Neurosciences will now initiate the manufacturing of the vector, followed by meetings with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the near future with the aim of moving towards the first clinical trials in patients.

OMED Health ("OMED"), a UK-based business pioneering non-invasive breath analysis for gut health and part of Owlstone Medical ("Owlstone"), the global leader in Breath Biopsy® for applications in early disease detection and precision medicine, today announced the launch of OMED Health Plans, personalized treatments and services to help patients gain control of their functional gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, a problem that affects over one billion people worldwide.

OMED Health Plans, available first in Great Britain, include the diagnosis of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) through at-home breath testing and substrate tests using the proprietary OMED Health Breath Analyzer, supporting the push to move care from hospitals to communities; clinician-led care pathways including nutritional protocols such as FODMAP and therapeutic interventions; and 1:1 clinical consultation for ongoing expert support. Initially the Plans will be made available through healthcare providers, who will leverage the platform to offer efficient non-invasive GI diagnostics alongside targeted treatment to reduce delivery costs and improve patient outcomes, and to consumers.

Digestive health is one of the largest untapped opportunities in consumer-facing diagnostics and chronic disease management,

Through the expanded OMED offering, patients with functional GI conditions will for the first time be able to access end-to-end, clinician-led, and evidence-based treatment plans utilizing longitudinal breath monitoring, optimized specifically for them based on their breath profiles."

Billy Boyle, CEO and Co-founder, Owlstone Medical

Feedback from participants in pilot programs has been very positive, with many citing significantly improved digestive health following diagnosis of SIBO or IMO using the OMED Breath Analyzer and subsequent treatment and follow-up monitoring.

"Owlstone is building a category-defining platform through OMED Health at the intersection of diagnostics, digital health, therapeutics, and personalized care," added Boyle. "With recurring revenue potential, robust unit economics, and a vast addressable market, OMED is well positioned to address a major gap in chronic GI care, enabling rapid growth by providing effective, evidence-based GI care at scale. Beyond the significant opportunity in Great Britain, there is large upside potential through expansion to other markets through strategic partnerships and licensing."

A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event for patients that can cause short- and long-term mental health concerns as they shift to living within a new timeline driven by weeks or months between medical follow-up appointments. A new survey conducted on behalf of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC – James) highlights the widespread emotional impact of cancer, revealing what weighs heavy on the minds of adults when a loved one is diagnosed.

Kevin Johns, MD, director of the psychosocial oncology program at the OSUCCC – James said studies suggest that up to cancer patients are five times as likely to experience depression than the average population and an estimated 42% of breast cancer survivors experience anxiety.

Depression and anxiety can significantly impact a patient's ability to finish care and fully recover after treatment – all of which impacts long-term survival. It's not uncommon for patients to wait up to a year to see a psychiatrist, depending on where they live and what insurance they have. Patients going through cancer treatment simply can't wait that long – the need is acute but also chronic, so timely access is critical. We are working to fill those gaps in care to better support our patients and their caregivers."

Kevin Johns, MD, director of the psychosocial oncology program, OSUCCC – James

A recent survey commissioned by the OSUCCC – James among U.S. adults age 18 or older focused on the top concerns when a loved one is diagnosed with cancer. The survey found that over three-quarters of adults surveyed list life expectancy (76%), course of treatment (69%) and pain (65%) as top concerns they have about loved ones diagnosed with cancer. The list of concerns was extensive, including: 

Side effects (55%) 

Family stress (54%)

Grief (49%)

Medication (42%)

Caregiver stress (34%)

Body image (11%)

None of the above (2%)

"The complex nature of caregivers' concerns is very representative of the unique challenges we face as a mental health community in supporting our patients through treatment and into their 'new normal' as a cancer survivor," Johns said. "It is truly a life journey, and like any journey, it can have extreme ups and downs that must be navigated. Helping our patients thrive beyond the diagnosis through proper mental health care is paramount to achieving high quality of life." 

Other notable points from the survey: 

Young Americans ages 18-29 are more likely than all other age groups to report grief (66%) as a top concern when a family member is diagnosed with cancer. 

Young adults are also more likely than older adults, age 65 and over, to say that body image (18%) is a top concern. 

Conversely, the oldest Americans are more likely than the youngest Americans to say that course of treatment (74%) and caregiver stress (37%) are top concerns for them when a loved one is diagnosed.

Johns noted that mental health is especially complicated in the cancer survivor population because challenges can manifest in different ways at different stages of the cancer journey through diagnosis, treatment and survivorship follow-up. He cited cognitive changes, severe fatigue, "brain fog" brought on by the effects of treatment, and even PTSD-like (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms or hallucinations and hospital delirium as side effects of cancer that are not often talked about but that can be very jarring for patients and caregivers alike.

"If patients or their caregivers are not warned beforehand that these symptoms can occur, it can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety and shame, so it is very important that we work with our patients and caregivers upfront to prepare them for what might happen," said Johns. 

Under Johns' leadership, the OSUCCC – James Psychosocial Oncology Program has greatly expanded its team of psychiatric providers, psychologists, social workers and other mental health professionals to support OSUCCC – James patients. 

In addition, Johns also helped the OSUCCC - James pilot an innovative oncology consulting service to help breast medical oncologists navigate medical management of anxiety and depression among their patients. The pilot initiative was received positively by patients and the medical oncologists and is now being expanded to serve patients with head and neck cancer.

"Patients going through cancer treatment already have so many appointments, and generally they develop a very close relationship with their medical oncologist, so this practitioner also becomes the default mental health provider if they do not have immediate access to a specialized health care provider," said Johns. "This new model of support was designed to help extend existing mental health support services to as many patients as possible."

This study was conducted by SSRS on its Opinion Panel Omnibus platform. The SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus is a national, twice-per-month, probability-based survey. Data collection was conducted from May 2 – May 5, 2025 among a sample of 1,008 respondents. The survey was conducted via web (n=978) and telephone (n=30) and administered in English. The margin of error for total respondents is +/-3.6 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population of U.S. adults ages 18 or older.

Rehab hospitals that help people recover from major surgeries and injuries have become a highly lucrative slice of the health care business. But federal data and inspection reports show that some run by the dominant company, Encompass Health Corp., and other for-profit corporations have had rare but serious incidents of patient harm and perform below average on two key safety measures tracked by Medicare.

Yet even when inspections reveal grave cases of injury, federal health officials do not inform consumers or impose fines the way they do for nursing homes. And Medicare doesn't provide easy-to-understand five-star ratings as it does for general hospitals.

In the most serious problems documented by regulators, rehab hospital errors involved patient deaths.

In Encompass Health's hospital in Huntington, West Virginia, Elizabeth VanBibber, 73, was fatally poisoned by a carbon monoxide leak during construction at the facility.

At its hospital in Jackson, Tennessee, a patient, 68, was found dead overnight, lying on the floor in a "pool of blood" after an alarm that was supposed to alert nurses that he had gotten out of bed had been turned off.

In its hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a nurse gave Frederick Roufs, 73, the wrong drug, one of 26 medication errors the hospital made over six months. He died two days later at another hospital.

"I can still see Fred laying in the bed as they shut each little machine off," said his widow, Susan Roufs. "They clicked four of them, and then the love of my life was gone."

Encompass, which owns 168 hospitals and admitted 248,000 patients last year, has led the transformation of this niche industry. In 2023, stand-alone for-profit medical rehabilitation hospitals overtook nonprofits as the places where the majority of annual patient admissions occur, a KFF Health News and New York Times analysis found. A third of all admissions were to Encompass hospitals. Such facilities are required to provide three hours of therapy a day, five days a week.

Across the nation, there are now nearly 400 stand-alone rehab hospitals, the bulk of which are for-profit. These hospitals collectively generate profits of 10%, more than general hospitals, which earn about 6%, and far more than skilled nursing homes, which make less than 0.5%, according to the most recent data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent congressional agency.

At the same time, the number of small, specialized units within acute care hospitals — where most rehab used to be provided — has dwindled. There are now around 800 of those, and most are nonprofits.

In its latest annual report, Encompass, which is publicly traded, reported an 11% net profit in 2024, earning $597 million last year on revenues of $5.4 billion.

Federal data on the performance of about 1,100 of the rehab facilities show Encompass tends to be better at helping most patients return home and remain there. In a two-year period ending in September 2023, Medicare rated 233 rehab facilities as performing better than the national rate for this major metric, called "discharge to community." Most rehabs with better community discharge rates are for-profit, and Encompass owns 79 of them.

But data from Medicare also reveals Encompass owns many of the rehabs with worse rates of potentially preventable, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Medicare evaluates how often patients are rehospitalized for conditions that might have been averted with proper care, including infections, bedsores, dehydration, and kidney failures.

Encompass accounts for about 1 in 7 rehab facilities nationally, but owned 34 of the 41 inpatient rehab facilities that Medicare rated as having statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions for discharged patients. (Overall, rates of readmission after discharge ranged from 7% to 12%, with a median of 9%.)

And it owned 28 of the 87 rehab facilities — 65 of which were for-profit — that had worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions to general hospitals during patient stays. (The median for these kinds of readmissions was 5%, and rates for individual rehabs ranged from 3% to 9%.)



Patrick Darby, the executive vice president and general counsel of Encompass, strongly defended the company's record in written responses to questions. He dismissed Medicare's readmissions ratings of "better," "worse," and "no different than the national rate" as "a crude scoring measure" and said "performance is so similar across the board." He called the violations found during health inspections "rare occurrences" that "do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns."

"The simplest and most accurate reason for EHC's success is that our hospitals provide superior care to patients," he said, referring to Encompass by its corporate initials.

Chih-Ying Li, an associate professor of occupational therapy at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston School of Health Professions, said in an interview that a research study she conducted found the profit status of a rehab facility was the only characteristic associated with higher unplanned readmissions.

"The finding is pretty robust," she said. "It's not like huge, huge differences, but there are differences."

VanBibber was admitted to Encompass' Huntington hospital in 2021 for therapy to strengthen her lungs. At the time, the hospital was undergoing a $3 million expansion, and state regulators had warned the company that areas of the hospital occupied by patients had to be isolated from the construction "using airtight barriers," according to a health inspection report.

In her room, which was about 66 feet from the construction zone, she began having trouble breathing, the report said. When she told the staff, they ignored her and shut her door, according to a lawsuit brought by her estate. Staff members eventually noticed that she was "lethargic and gasping for air," and called 911.

When the emergency medical squad arrived, the carbon monoxide detectors they wore sounded. By that time, VanBibber's blood oxygen levels were dangerously low, the inspection report said. She died three days later from respiratory failure and carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the inspection report and the lawsuit. A plumber had been using a gas-powered saw in the construction area, but there were no carbon monoxide detectors in the hallways, the report said.

In court papers, Encompass and its construction contractors denied negligence for VanBibber's death. The case is pending.

Inspectors determined Encompass failed to maintain a safe environment for all patients during construction and didn't properly evaluate other patients for signs of poisoning, the report said.

Since 2021, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees health inspections, has found that 10 Encompass hospitals, including the one that cared for VanBibber, had immediate jeopardy violations, federal records show. Such violations — like the ones that Medicare also found in connection with the deaths of Roufs and the patient who fell after leaving his bed — mean a hospital's failure to comply with federal rules has put patients at risk for serious injury, serious harm, serious impairment, or death.

Darby, the general counsel for Encompass, said the company regretted any clinical problems and had promptly addressed all such findings to the satisfaction of inspectors. He said Encompass that has an "excellent compliance record," including superior results from its accreditation agency, and that its overall number of health citations was tiny given how many hospitals Encompass owns and how many patients it treats.

Six other corporate-operated for-profit hospitals were also cited, while none of the 31 stand-alone nonprofit rehab hospitals received such violations from 2021 to 2024. (Inspection reports for general hospitals do not systematically specify in which part of the building a violation occurred, so rehab unit violations cannot be identified.)

An alert called a bed alarm was at the root of immediate jeopardies at Encompass hospitals in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Jackson, Tennessee. The devices are pressure- and motion-sensitive and emit a sound and display a light to alert staff members that someone at a high risk of falls has left his or her bed.

In its Morgantown hospital, a nurse technician discovered a patient face down on the floor with a large gash on her head after a defective alarm did not go off, an inspection report said. After she died, the nurse told inspectors: "We are having a lot of problems with the bed alarms."

Medicare is not authorized by law to fine rehab hospitals for safety rule violations, even ones involving deaths uncovered during inspections, as it has done with nearly 8,000 nursing homes during the last three years, imposing average fines of about $28,000.

The only option is to entirely cut off a rehab hospital's reimbursement for all services by Medicare and Medicaid, which cover most patients. That step would most likely put it out of business and is almost never used because of its draconian consequences.

"Termination is typically a last resort after working with the provider to come back into compliance," Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson, said in an email.

As a result, because there's no graduated penalty, even the most serious — and rare — immediate jeopardy violations effectively carry no punishments so long as the hospital puts steps in place to avert future problems.

"Only having a nuclear weapon has really hurt patient safety," said Michael Millenson, a medical quality advocate.

One immediate jeopardy incident did result in a punishment, but only because the hospital was in California, which allows its health department to issue penalties. Encompass' Bakersfield hospital paid a $75,000 fine last year for failing to control the blood sugar of a patient who died after her heart stopped.

Encompass has accelerated its expansion in recent years and now operates in 38 states and Puerto Rico. It plans to open 17 more hospitals in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah by the end of 2027, according to its latest report.

It frequently moves into new markets by persuading local nonprofit hospitals to shutter their rehab units in exchange for an equity stake in a newly built Encompass hospital, company executives have told investors.

The president of Encompass, Mark Tarr, calls it a "win-win proposition": The local hospitals can use their emptied space for a more lucrative line of service and Encompass gets a "jump start" into a new market, with partner hospitals often referring patients.

Tarr, who was paid $9.3 million in compensation last year, told investors that Encompass requires that the existing hospitals sign a noncompete deal. Sixty-seven Encompass hospitals are joint ventures, mostly with nonprofit hospitals as investors, according to the company's June financial filing, the most recent available.

Darby said the company's profits allow it to build hospitals in areas that lack intensive inpatient rehabilitation and improve existing hospitals. "High-quality patient care is not only consistent with shareholder return, but quality and shareholder return are in fact critical to one another," he said.

The success of Encompass is particularly notable given that it barely survived what experts said was one of the largest modern accounting scandals in 2003.

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that the company, then known as HealthSouth, overstated earnings by $2.7 billion to meet Wall Street analyst quarterly expectations, leading to the ouster of its founder and directors. In 2004, the company agreed to pay the government $325 million to settle Medicare fraud allegations without admitting wrongdoing. Darby credited the company's new leaders for obtaining a $2.9 billion judgment on behalf of shareholders against the company's founder.

The company changed its name to Encompass in 2018 after acquiring Encompass Home Health and Hospice. In 2019, the Justice Department announced the company had agreed to pay $48 million to settle whistleblower lawsuit claims that it misdiagnosed patients to get higher Medicare reimbursements, and admitted patients who were too sick to benefit from therapy. The company denied any wrongdoing, blaming independent physicians who worked at its hospitals. Darby said Encompass settled the case only to "avoid more years of expense and disruption." He said the Justice Department never filed a lawsuit despite years of investigation.

Rehab hospital inspection reports are not posted on Care Compare, Medicare's online search tool for consumers. KFF Health News had to sue CMS under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain all its inspection reports for rehab hospitals. In contrast, Care Compare publishes all nursing home inspection reports and assigns each facility a star rating for its adherence to health and safety rules.

So people now choosing a rehab hospital would not know that at the Encompass hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 2021, a nurse accidentally gave Roufs a blood pressure drug called hydralazine instead of hydroxyzine, his prescribed anti-anxiety medication, according to an inspection report. Roufs went into cardiac arrest. This type of error, called a "look-alike/sound-alike," is one hospitals and staff members are supposed to be especially alert to.

Months before, an internal safety committee had identified a trend of medication errors, including when a nurse accidentally gave a patient 10 times the prescribed amount of insulin, sending him to the hospital, the inspection report said. The nurse had misread four units as 40. Since Roufs's death, inspectors have faulted the hospital six times for various lapses, most recently in April 2024 for improper wound care.

An Encompass hospital in Texarkana, Texas, misused antipsychotic medications to pacify patients, resulting in an immediate jeopardy finding from CMS, the report said. And the company's hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, was issued an immediate jeopardy violation for not keeping track of medication orders in 2023, when a patient had a cardiac arrest after not receiving all of his drugs, according to the inspection report.

The federal government's overall quality oversight efforts are limited. Medicare docks payment to rehab facilities for patients readmitted to a general hospital during shorter-than-average rehab stays, but unlike at general hospitals, there are no financial penalties when recently discharged rehab patients are hospitalized for critical health issues.

The Biden administration announced last year it intended to develop a rating scale of 1 to 5 stars for rehab facilities. The industry's trade association, the American Medical Rehabilitation Providers Association, requested a delay in the creation of star ratings until the current quality measures were refined. The Trump administration has not determined whether it will continue the effort to rate rehab facilities, according to a CMS spokesperson.

The family of Paul Webb Jr., 74, claimed in a lawsuit that the Encompass hospital in Erie left Webb unattended in a wheelchair for hours at a time, putting pressure on his tailbone, in 2021. His medical records, provided to reporters by the family, list a sitting tolerance of one hour.

Webb — who had been originally hospitalized after a brain bleed, a type of stroke — developed skin damage known as a pressure sore, or bedsore, on his bottom, the lawsuit said. The suit said the sore worsened after he was sent to a nursing home, which the family is also suing, then home, and he died later that year. In his final weeks, Webb was unable to stand, sit, or move much because of the injury, the lawsuit said.

In court papers, Encompass and the nursing home denied negligence, as Encompass has in some other pending and closed lawsuits that accused it of failing to prevent pressure sores because nurses and aides failed to regularly reposition patients, or notice and treat emerging sores. Darby said Webb's death occurred three months after his Encompass stay and was not related to his care at Encompass. He said no hospital with long-term patients could prevent every new or worsening pressure sore, but that Encompass' rates were similar to the 1% national average.

One of Webb's sons, Darel Webb, recalled a warning given to the family as they left an appointment their father had with wound specialists: A doctor brought up Christopher Reeve, the actor who played Superman in movies in the 1970s and 1980s.

"He goes, 'Remember, Superman was paralyzed from falling off the horse, but he died from a bedsore,'" he said.

Jordan Rau has been writing about hospital safety since 2008. Irena Hwang is a New York Times data reporter who uses computational tools to uncover hidden stories and illuminate the news.

To examine the medical rehabilitation hospital industry, we obtained and analyzed a database of inspection reports of freestanding rehabilitation hospitals from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. We also obtained inspection reports from several states through public records requests.

We analyzed inpatient rehabilitation facility characteristics and patient volume data contained in hospital data files from the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization. This dataset compiles cost reports all hospitals submit each year to CMS. For each facility for the years 2012 to 2023, we categorized annual discharges by facility type (freestanding rehabilitation hospital or unit within an acute care hospital); facility ownership status (for-profit, nonprofit, or government); and which hospitals were owned by Encompass Health under its current or prior name, HealthSouth.

Financial information about Encompass Health was obtained from the company's Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure filings.

We examined the readmission rates for all inpatient rehabilitation facilities that CMS publishes in its quality data. CMS evaluates the frequency with which Medicare patients were readmitted for potentially preventable reasons to an acute care hospital during their rehab stay. Separately, CMS also evaluates the frequency of potentially preventable readmissions to an acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from rehab. We also examined the rate of successful return to home or community. Figures for all three metrics were available for about 1,100 of the roughly 1,200 rehab facilities in the CMS data. The most recent readmission data covered Medicare discharges from October 2021 through September 2023.

We examined nursing home penalties from the last three years from CMS' data on nursing homes.

New study shows that autism is not one condition, but four, each driven by different genes and brain development patterns, helping to reshape diagnosis and care.

Study: Decomposition of phenotypic heterogeneity in autism reveals underlying genetic programs. Image credit: chrupka/Shutterstock.com

A paper published in Nature Genetics provides a new glimpse into the role of genetic variation in the range of clinical symptoms found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The team of researchers found that autism classes can be clinically distinguished. Each is associated with unique patterns of gene dysregulation, reflecting distinct molecular-level perturbations caused by class-specific sets of mutations.

ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties with social communication and interaction, often demonstrating restricted and repetitive behavior patterns, interests, or activities. With an increasing ASD burden each year, the phenotypic and genetic differences in the ASD pool are becoming more obvious.

A systematic evidence-based association study of genetic and phenotypic data has not matched the genetic and phenotypic complexity of ASD. The current study used a large sample of autism phenotypes to reveal phenotypic classes and the underlying genetic heterogeneity.

A person-centric method is essential in this analysis, rather than focusing on single traits, since each co-occurring trait inevitably affects the other. Only then can they be properly mapped to their genotypic origin. Such an approach provides a clearer picture of how these developmental disruptions interact and evolve, allowing for an informed prognosis.

This approach avoids the limitation of traditional trait-centric analyses and better captures the complex, interacting nature of ASD symptoms in real individuals.

The current study used genotypic and phenotypic data from the SPARK cohort of 5,392 people. They collected phenotypic data from standard diagnostic questionnaires (the Social Communication Questionnaire-Lifetime (SCQ), Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), and the Child Behavior Checklist 6–18 (CBCL), combined with the developmental milestone history.

Researchers applied a generative finite mixture modelling (GFMM) framework to analyze 239 features, allowing individuals to be grouped into clinically meaningful phenotypic classes based on their overall trait profiles.

The model distinguished autism classes using the seven core traits: limited social communication, restricted and/or repetitive behavior, attention deficit, disruptive behavior, anxiety and/or mood symptoms, developmental delay (DD), self-injury, and the severity of symptoms. They assigned each of 239 phenotype features associated or co-occurring with each trait.

Four ASD phenotypic classes emerged. One class (Social/behavioral) had both severe social communication deficits and restricted or repetitive behavior, compared to other ASD children. They also showed disruptive behavior and attention deficit, with anxiety, but normal developmental rates.

The Mixed ASD class distinctively shows developmental delay, despite some features of social communication deficits, restricted/repetitive behavior, and self-injury. The other two classes were Moderate challenges, with a lower ASD score for all seven core traits than other ASD children but above non-autistic siblings, and Broadly affected, with a higher score than other ASD children.

These classes were validated by their agreement with the reported co-occurring conditions, parental narratives, and medical history. For instance, the Broadly affected class was much more likely to have all co-occurring conditions: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), delayed language development, anxiety, and depression.

Conversely, the Mixed ASD class had the lowest odds of anxiety, depression, or ADHD. Yet they were at high risk for language and intellectual delay, and motor abnormalities, concordant with their delayed development and high occurrence of restricted/repetitive behavior. In contrast, the Social/behavioral class had a higher risk of ASD-associated ADHD, anxiety, and depression diagnoses.

Mixed ASD and Broadly affected classes were usually diagnosed the earliest. They were most likely to be receiving a variety of therapies, due to the highest cognitive impairment and poor language skills. The Broadly affected class also showed the most significant co-occurring conditions and the highest use of clinical interventions.

An independent cohort of autistic subjects also confirmed the validity of these classes. The model showed a high correlation in feature enrichment patterns across the SPARK and SSC cohorts, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.

The scientists then investigated genetic influences using polygenic scores (PGS) for autism and five well-accepted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for autism-related conditions or traits. They explored both inherited and newly arising genetic variations. The findings revealed genetic differences according to the four classes.

The Broadly affected and Social/behavioral classes had higher ADHD PGS signals than for other classes or non-autistic siblings. Depression-related PGS and diagnosis rate were both highest in the Social/behavioral class. This class also had the highest number of high-impact variants in neuronal genes, mainly expressed after birth. However, ASD PGS did not differ significantly between classes due to high within-group variance, highlighting the limited explanatory power of current common-variant-based ASD scores.

The Broadly affected class, which showed the highest rate of cognitive impairment, delayed development, and the lowest educational status, had the lowest IQ PGS. Thus, “co-occurring conditions were associated with common genetic variation that significantly differed among the four identified classes.”

All four classes had more mutations than non-autistic siblings, and mutations were unevenly distributed between the classes. The Broadly affected class had excessive loss-of-function (LoF) or missense mutations, and the social/behavioral class was the least enriched.

Whilst all four classes showed more mutations than non-ASD siblings, the Broadly affected class had the highest high-impact de novo mutations. In contrast, the Mixed ASD class showed increased rare inherited variation alongside de novo mutations, indicating a stronger inherited genetic component.

ASD-specific gene set analysis showed a higher burden of new LoF mutations associated with developmental delay. High-impact mutations in a relatively small group of genes contribute to cognitive impairment. The greater the development delay in the class, the higher the odds for new LoF mutations.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) target gene mutations were especially enriched in the Broadly affected class and the Mixed ASD class. FMRP in both Broadly affected and Mixed ASD classes was linked to developmental delay and cognitive deficit. The Broadly affected class showed additional enrichment for mood and behavioral traits such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and aggression.

Tracing the molecular pathways affected by these mutations showed that each class reflected specific pathway disruptions. For instance, disruption of microtubule activity, chromatin organization, and DNA repair was enriched in the Social/behavioral class, compared to neuronal action potential and membrane depolarization in Mixed ASD.

In the Mixed ASD class, LoF mutations affected prefrontal cortical neuronal genes expressed primarily during fetal and early newborn life. This class, therefore, had the most developmental delay and the earliest diagnosis, compared to the Social/behavioral class, where postnatal gene expression was disrupted.

The Broadly affected class showed gene dysregulation spanning all developmental stages and cell types, especially of FMRP target genes and highly constrained genes. In contrast, the Moderate challenges class had enrichment for variants in genes with lower evolutionary constraint, which may explain the milder developmental impact.

The study demonstrated the value of a person-centered rather than a trait-centric approach to ASD genotype-phenotype analysis. The four phenotype-based classes described here agreed with reported clinical features and can be applied to any clinical cohort. Importantly, it suggests that ASD phenotypes do not reflect a spectrum of intellectual disability.

The classes also had separate genetic signals and differed in the timing of gene dysregulation during the developmental trajectory. These differences correlate with the degree of delay in development and the outcome.

The study provides a framework to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying distinct ASD presentations, supported by genetic and molecular data across developmental stages.

These findings suggest new research directions to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying different ASD presentations, allowing for more precise diagnosis and management of these conditions.

New survey data from the Orlando Health Spine Center reveals a significant difference among Americans on how to manage neck and back pain. Respondents were split between relying on rest and reduced activity (44%), turning to over-the-counter pain relievers (42%), and hot/cold therapies (29%) - an uncertainty that may be discouraging some from seeking medical guidance.

We want patients living their best life. We want patients to be able to do the things they love with their family and friends. If they come to see us, we will be able to offer therapies or treatments to get them back to where they were much quicker."

Brian Braithwaite, M.D., Interventional Spine & Pain Physician at the Orlando Health Spine Center

Dr. Braithwaite determines the best course of treatment for each patient at the Orlando Health Spine Center by starting with thorough examinations and images such as MRI or CT scans, ensuring a personalized approach to pain management. 

"Once we have a good idea of what's causing their pain, then it's easy to come up with the plan," said Dr. Braithwaite. "It's very important that we're able to offer patients conservative alternatives because many times they don't need anything invasive to feel better."

Reeta Brendamour, 66, experienced excruciating shoulder pain and arm numbness that kept her from enjoying her favorite activities and a once-active lifestyle. She initially tried home remedies and avoided seeing a doctor, concerned that surgery might be her only option. 

According to the survey, she's not alone, only 5% of Americans consider surgery their top option for relieving pain. "I didn't want surgery. I didn't even want to go to the doctor to find out what was going on," Brendamour said. "I just avoided it."

When the pain became too much to bear, Reeta scheduled an appointment with Dr. Braithwaite, who diagnosed her with arthritis and degenerative disc disease. She learned the pain she was experiencing stemmed from her neck and he recommended steroid injections to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain. 

"Within two days, all my pain and all the numbness was gone," said Brendamour. "It was a miracle. It truly was a miracle. I can now do things that I didn't think I was going to be able to do anymore."

The treatment allowed her to return to activities she loves, including golfing, teaching yoga and traveling the world.

Dr. Braithwaite reminds patients that aging doesn't have to mean living in pain. "Longevity and happiness aren't just about living pain-free - it's about maintaining function," he said. "Your body doesn't heal like it used to, so it may require injection therapy or other treatments to accelerate the healing process and provide a full recovery."

The Orlando Health Spine Center offers a comprehensive range of treatments for various conditions. 

"It's a one-stop shop - no matter what's going on with a patient's spine, neck or lower back, we can evaluate and help them feel better," said Dr. Braithwaite. "Whether it's conservative treatment, physical therapy or imaging, everything can be done in-house to help patients find relief." 

This survey was conducted online within the United States by Ipsos on the KnowledgePanel® from May 30 to June 1, 2025, and surveyed 1,024 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This poll is based on a nationally representative probability sample and has margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points at the 95%confidence level, for results based on the entire sample of adults.

Lower levels of certain vitamins and minerals were found to be associated with chronic pain in a recently completed study led by researchers at the University of Arizona Health Sciences and published in Pain Practice. 

This is the first study to take a precision medicine approach to chronic pain on a large scale by broadly examining micronutrient levels of people with and without chronic pain and exploring the incidence of chronic pain in people with or without micronutrient deficiencies. The findings could inform personalized nutritional strategies to help manage chronic pain.

"I treat chronic pain patients, and oftentimes we don't come up with a diagnosis. But just because there isn't a surgery that will help you doesn't mean you're not in pain. It's just means that our understanding of pain is limited to date," said senior author Julie Pilitsis, MD, PhD, head of the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson Department of Neurosurgery and member of the Comprehensive Center for Pain & Addiction.

This study is a novel way to approach chronic pain treatment, where you are looking at the patient holistically to see what could be going on systemically that is easily modifiable – changes in diet as opposed to medications or other things."

Julie Pilitsis, University of Arizona Health Sciences

The research team focused on five micronutrients commonly associated with chronic pain: vitamins D, B12, and C, folate and magnesium. They examined the micronutrient status of three groups: people without pain, people with mild-to-moderate chronic pain and people with severe chronic pain.

They found that for vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium, people with severe deficiencies were more likely to have severe chronic pain. Conversely, lower levels of vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium – and a greater incidence of those low levels – were seen in people with severe chronic pain.

"The finding that surprised us the most was that Asian females had higher vitamin B12 levels than expected," said co-author Deborah Morris, PhD, a research laboratory manager in the Department of Neurosurgery, explaining that B12 deficiencies were seen in other gender, race and ethnicity groups. "Asian females with severe chronic pain had the highest vitamin B12 levels overall. We were expecting it to be lower."

The results varied for vitamin C, where males with mild-to-moderate and severe chronic pain were more likely to have low and borderline low levels of vitamin C than males without chronic pain. Men with borderline and severe vitamin C deficiency were also more likely to have chronic pain.

Participant data came from the National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Database, where the largest enrollment has come from the University of Arizona-Banner Health program.

"The findings that are coming from complex demographic studies such as this one show that we can't just make assumptions for every patient that walks in the office," said Pilitsis, who is a member of the BIO5 Institute.

"Our study across various chronic pain conditions in a large, diverse population found that certain vitamins and mineral deficiencies are more frequent in people with chronic pain, and particularly in some in specific racial and ethnic groups," Morris added. "Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people with chronic pain and reduce opioid usage, and these findings have the potential to do that as part of a holistic approach to pain management."

A November 2024 data brief from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that nearly 25% of U.S. adults are living with chronic pain, which is associated with decreased quality of life, opioid misuse, increased anxiety and depression, and unmet mental health needs.

Morris and Pilitsis collaborated with researchers at Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Grigore T. Popa in Romania, and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium.

Popular anti-obesity medications continue to be effective for weight loss even when availability and access is interrupted, according to a study being presented by a private weight-loss company Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

"Patients taking GLP-1 treatments like semaglutide and tirzepatide often face challenges consistently accessing their medications due to supply shortages or insurance coverage obstacles," said Kaelen L. Medeiros, M.S., director of data and research at privately held weight-loss company Calibrate in New York, N.Y.

While unpredictable GLP-1 medication access is frustrating, the good news is that our research shows effective weight loss can still be achieved if paired with appropriate lifestyle changes and coaching support."

Kaelen L. Medeiros, Director, Data and Research, Calibrate

Researchers looked at how interruptions to GLP-1 medication access impacted weight-loss outcomes in real-world patients taking part in a commercial metabolic health program that also included intensive lifestyle intervention. Participants followed an intensive lifestyle change curriculum that emphasized the four pillars of metabolic health: food, exercise, sleep and emotional health, while receiving one-on-one health coaching.

The study reviewed records for 6,392 participants who had at least one month of GLP-1 access and completed at least one year in an obesity and overweight care program. Of these participants, 72.5% experienced at least one disruption in their GLP-1 treatment and 11.1% had multiple disruptions. Participants received an average of 8.13 GLP-1 fills during the first year of research and 15.25 fills during the second year.

After 12 months, participants who faced access issues achieved 13.7% weight loss in 12 months and 14.9% in 24 months. Those without treatment interruptions had 17% weight loss in 12 months and 20.1% in 24 months. Those who received only 1 to 4 treatments over 12 months also achieved clinically significant weight loss, with more than 10% change in body weight on average.

"Given the often-unpredictable availability and shifting insurance coverage associated with anti-obesity medications, it's important that patients understand the significant impact that lifestyle changes and coaching paired with treatment can have on their health outcomes," Medeiros said.

While findings indicate that significant weight loss is still possible for those with inconsistent access to GLP-1 medications, Medeiros said the results found that a consistent medication course combined with lifestyle changes and support remains the most effective weight-loss program option.

Adrenal hormone function was restored in animal studies, potentially paving the way for a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency in humans, according to research being presented by Aspect Biosystems on Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

Primary adrenal insufficiency, most commonly due to Addison's disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is a life-threatening condition that typically requires lifelong adrenal hormone replacement.

However, the current hormone replacement therapies have a significant treatment burden and fail to mimic the natural circadian rhythms of hormone secretion.

Our research shows that our adrenal Bioprinted Tissue Therapeutics (BTTs)-an 'off-the-shelf,' implantable cell therapy-can restore natural hormone function and perform long-term in animals, demonstrating its potential to offer a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency."

Sam Wadsworth, Ph.D., CSO at Aspect Biosystems

The company's adrenal Bioprinted Tissue Therapeutics (BTTs) were studied in vitro to confirm their viability over time.

In the lab, the team at Aspect Biosystems stimulated the adrenal BTTs with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is typically released from the brain to stimulate cortisol release and observed a consistent cortisol release.

The BTTs were then implanted into mice that had undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands.

"Following implantation, mice that received adrenal BTTs showed a rapid and sustained increase in circulating cortisol, which is not endogenously produced in mice," Wadsworth said.

This confirmed that the adrenal BTTs were responsive.

"Notably, cortisol secretion followed the animals' circadian rhythm, replicating their natural daily hormone cycle," Wadsworth said. "In contrast, mice implanted with cell-free implants showed no significant cortisol levels and did not respond to ACTH stimulation."

The adrenal BTT-treated mice also showed improved survival, which continued throughout the study period of about six months.

"This novel approach has the potential to serve as a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency, transforming the lives of patients with this disease," Wadsworth said.

A novel AI-powered retina tracker can analyze retinal images with near-perfect accuracy in under one second, according to a study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. The researchers say the findings offer hope for sight-saving screenings for diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases that are fast, affordable, and accessible worldwide.

The application, an AI-based model integrated into Simple Mobile AI Retina Tracker (SMART), uses cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to analyze retinal fundus images quickly and accurately, on internet-powered devices including basic smartphones. The SMART AI application enables ophthalmologists to streamline patient screening, empowers primary care providers to incorporate eye exams into routine visits, and expands access to high-quality retinal assessments in regions lacking specialized ophthalmic care."

Jansi Rani Sethuraj, B.S.N., R.N., C.C.R.N., presenting author of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, Texas

Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of preventable blindness, affects over 100 million people globally as the incidence and prevalence of diabetes continue to rise worldwide.

Two researchers, Ramya Elangovan and Kavin Elangovan of AIM Doctor in Houston, Texas, sourced several thousand anonymized retinal images from multiple datasets representing diverse populations spanning six continents. These images were used to train and validate deep learning models capable of detecting and staging diabetic retinopathy with over 99% accuracy in under one second. The tracker was also able to differentiate diabetic retinopathy from similar eye pathologies. Healthcare professionals from multiple international institutions independently validated the application's reliability and usability, underscoring its global applicability.

"By democratizing eye care through universally accessible mobile technology, this innovation has the potential to screen billions globally, reducing vision loss from diabetic retinopathy while transforming healthcare delivery systems," said the chief mentor of this project, Elangovan Krishnan, M.B., B.S., P.G.D.H.M., M.Tech., M.S., Ph.D., of AIM Doctor. "This research proves that AI can be a force for good, bridging gaps in care and bringing hope to millions at risk of losing their sight."

Anti-obesity medications can significantly raise testosterone levels and improve health outcomes for men with obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to a new study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

Testosterone not only plays a critical role in the body when it comes to male sexual functioning, but it can also have an impact on an individual's bone mass, fat distribution, muscle mass, strength and red blood cell production. Increases in body weight and prevalence of type 2 diabetes are often associated with lowered testosterone levels, resulting in fatigue, decreased libido and quality of life.

While it is well known that weight loss from lifestyle changes or bariatric surgery increases testosterone levels, the impact that anti-obesity medications may also have on these levels has not been widely studied. Our study is among the first to provide compelling evidence that low testosterone can be reversed with the use of commonly prescribed anti-obesity medications."

Shellsea Portillo Canales, M.D., endocrinology fellow at SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital in St. Louis, Mo.

To test this hypothesis, researchers analyzed the electronic health records of 110 adult men with obesity or type 2 diabetes being treated with the weight-loss medications semaglutide, dulaglutide or tirzepatide and who were not on testosterone or hormonal therapy. Participants' total and free testosterone levels were measured before and during treatment over the course of 18 months.

Along with 10% weight loss, the proportion of men with normal levels of both total and free testosterone rose from 53% to 77%. These findings indicate that anti-obesity medications also can have a positive effect on the reproductive health of men with obesity or type 2 diabetes.

"Results from this study show that there is a direct correlation between the use of anti-obesity medications and testosterone levels," said Portillo Canales. "Doctors and their patients can now consider this class of medications not only for the treatment of obesity and to control blood sugar, but also to benefit men's reproductive health."

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a serious kidney disease in children with no clear cause. In a recent study, researchers have identified a novel autoantibody targeting vinculin—a protein crucial for kidney cell structure—as a significant factor in INS. The study found that these autoantibodies are present during active diseases and decline when symptoms subside, suggesting potential for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Mouse models were further used to validate these findings.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), particularly prevalent in children, is a kidney disorder marked by severe protein loss in the urine and low blood protein (albumin) levels. Growing body of research has shown that autoantibodies, or antibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body's own cells and proteins against podocytes may play a role in INS, but the precise underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

Now, however, a study by researchers from Zhejiang University, China, sheds light on this mystery by identifying a previously unrecognized immune factor: autoantibodies targeting vinculin, a key structural protein present in kidney cells. Their findings were published online in Research on June 3, 2025. The research team was led by Dr. Hanyan Meng from the Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China, sought to investigate the pathogenic role and underlying mechanisms of anti-vinculin autoantibodies in INS.

What exactly is vinculin, and why does it matter in kidney health? Vinculin is a protein that plays an important role in cell adhesion and cell mobility. These proteins are particularly found in podocytes and critical for podocyte cytoskeletal integrity. Anti-vinculin autoantibodies—the body's own antibodies that attack vinculin—can cause damage to the kidney's filtering cells.

By analyzing serum samples from across 147 children with INS, the researchers discovered significantly elevated levels of anti-vinculin autoantibodies compared to healthy and disease control groups.

These antibodies were present in over half of the INS patients and closely correlated with the clinical markers of disease severity, including cholesterol levels and protein in urine."

Dr. Hanyan Meng from the Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China

Notably, the antibody levels dropped as the children recovered, and over half of them no longer had these antibodies once their symptoms subsided. The team further conducted a series of experiments using mouse models to understand causality. When injected with anti-vinculin antibodies or when actively immunized with recombinant vinculin protein, the mice developed hallmark features of INS, including proteinuria (high levels of protein in urine) and cell injury, which were confirmed via immunofluorescence and electron microscopy.

Transcriptomic analysis of kidney tissue from these mice revealed an increased activation of genes associated with inflammation, B cell activation, and immune signaling, alongside downregulation of cytoskeletal genes. This suggests that anti-vinculin antibodies may not only damage podocytes directly but also activate a broader immune response that worsens the disease.

"These findings provide compelling evidence that anti-vinculin autoantibodies are not merely markers but active drivers of disease," highlights Dr. Meng. "They could serve as dynamic biomarkers for early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and risk stratification in pediatric nephrotic syndrome."

These findings add up to our understanding of INS and contribute to a growing body of work suggesting that various autoantibodies—against nephrin, Crb2, podocin, and other proteins found in the kidney's filtering units—may underlie different forms of kidney disease. Since vinculin is a critical structural protein in podocytes, its disruption by autoantibodies leads to loss of structural integrity and breakdown of the kidney's filtration barrier.

From a clinical perspective, the identification of anti-vinculin autoantibodies represents a significant step toward precision medicine for children with INS. While most pediatric patients respond well to steroids, a significant portion develops steroid resistance and doesn't respond well. The current study found that anti-vinculin antibodies were more prevalent in patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), suggesting their potential role in guiding treatment strategies.

"By adding antibody screening into routine clinical assessment, we may be able to reduce the need for invasive kidney biopsies and tailor better therapies to individual patients," adds Dr. Meng.

While the study holds significance, the authors acknowledge its limitations, calling for larger, multicenter studies to confirm the diagnostic value of anti-vinculin antibodies. In the future, their research will focus on how these autoantibodies are generated and how they access intracellular targets like vinculin, building on the understanding of INS and better strategies to overcome the disease.

New research uncovers just how much ultra-processed, high-energy food fills Australian supermarket shelves for children, raising alarms about kids' diets and calling for tougher food rules.

Study: Energy Density and Level of Processing of Packaged Food and Beverages Intended for Consumption by Australian Children. Image Credit: mamaza / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Nutrients, researchers analyzed the energy density (ED) and food processing levels in packaged food and drink items that were marketed towards young children and launched in Australia in recent years.

They found that 56% of the products they surveyed were high in ED (≥12.552 kJ/g or kJ/mL) while 81% were ultra-processed foods (UPFs; NOVA G4), highlighting the urgent need to introduce stricter regulations for food marketed to children.

Childhood obesity is a growing health issue in Australia, with one in four children (25.1%) affected (17% overweight and 8.1% obese). A poor diet, particularly high intake of ultra-processed and energy-dense foods, plays a significant role in this trend.

ED refers to the amount of energy (kilojoules) per gram or millilitre of food, and it is influenced mainly by fat (high ED) and water content (low ED). Foods with high ED are often less nutritious and linked to higher energy intake and weight gain.

UPFs, the most industrially processed category in the NOVA classification, often contain additives and modified ingredients to improve taste, appearance, and shelf life. These features can disrupt appetite regulation, leading to overeating and obesity in children. Despite this, children regularly consume large amounts of UPFs and high-ED foods.

Baby food dominated the under-5 market (95% of products), and over half of these items (57%) were ultra-processed, including growing-up milks marketed as supplements.

This study was the first in Australia to assess the packaged food environment for children using both ED and NOVA classifications over a 10-year period.

By examining food products launched since the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines, researchers aimed to understand how food processing and energy density have shaped children's food supply. The findings could support the development of stronger food marketing regulations for children and promote healthier food environments.

The research team used an observational and descriptive design to analyse packaged foods and drinks marketed to Australian children up to 12 years old between 2013 and 2023. They sourced food data from Mintel GNPD, a global dataset that tracks new products in major Australian supermarkets.

The products were classified into 'Food' and 'Drink' categories and subcategories, and only those with age-related marketing claims for the target age groups were included.

Data collected included product names, ingredients, nutritional information, and energy values. Energy density (ED) was calculated in kJ/g or kJ/mL and classified as low (≤4.184), medium (>4.184 to <12.552), or high (≥12.552).

The level of processing was determined using the NOVA classification system: unprocessed/minimally processed (G1), processed culinary ingredients (G2), processed (G3), and ultra-processed foods (G4). Products with vague ingredient lists were conservatively classified into lower NOVA groups.

Duplicate products and those with missing nutritional data were excluded. Researchers then used descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests to compare ED between UPFs and less-processed foods.

Even supposedly 'light' foods like fruit snacks and flavoured yoghurts often fell into the ultra-processed category, challenging the idea that low energy density always means healthy.

Between 2013 and 2023, 1,770 packaged food and drink products targeted at Australian children were released, with most (63%) aimed at children aged between 5 and 12 years old. Baby foods dominated the products for children under 5, while bakery, snacks, and confectionery items made up the bulk of products for older children.

Over half (56%) of all products were classified as high in ED, with the highest EDs observed in categories like snacks, confectionery, and chocolate. In contrast, baby food had the lowest median ED.

Regarding processing level, 81% of all products were classified as UPFs, including 93% of those for children between 5 and 12 years old, and 59% for those under 5 years old. Most high-ED products were also UPFs.

Significant differences between ED and NOVA categories were found only among foods for children under 5 years old (p<0.001), with high-ED products being more common in the UPF category for this group.

No significant differences were found for children between 5 and 12, as most products were UPFs regardless of ED. Low-ED UPFs, often perceived as healthy, such as fruit snacks, flavoured yoghurts, baby cereals, and growing-up milks, were also common, raising concerns about their potential impact on children's energy intake and appetite regulation.

The study flags a specific regulatory gap: growing-up milks (GUMs) – ultra-processed, high in free sugars, and not recommended by health authorities – faced no marketing restrictions despite their prevalence.

This study is the first in Australia to examine both energy density and food processing levels in products marketed to children. It found that most new packaged foods over the past decade were ultra-processed and energy-dense, particularly those for children between 5 and 12.

The findings raise concerns, especially for young children under 5, who are increasingly exposed to UPFs despite dietary guidelines promoting minimally processed foods during early development.

A key strength of the study is its use of a global database that captures recent trends in the marketplace. It also compared products across two age groups, offering valuable insights.

However, the database only includes newly launched items, potentially missing older products still on the market. The authors note that the Mintel GNPD likely represents a large proportion of the current Australian marketplace, but some products directed to children could have been missed. Additionally, the subjective nature of processing classification was addressed through a conservative approach: when ingredient lists were vague, products were classified into lower NOVA groups.

The study underscores the need for policy actions, such as stricter regulation of marketing and health claims, to reduce children's exposure to high-ED and UPF products and promote healthier food choices from an early age.

The English Premier League power stunned observers in Sunday's final by rolling past Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, an upset to cap off the first edition of a massively expanded tournament. President Trump — who spent plenty of time ahead of the event bonding with FIFA head Gianni Infantino — made his presence known after the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., taking the field to boos before lingering among Chelsea players in an awkward trophy ceremony.

Eventually, Chelsea captain Reece James managed to hoist the trophy, designed by Tiffany and Co. and inspired by the Voyager space probes. Still, per the president, that may not have been the same trophy that has spent much of the last few months sitting in the Oval Office.

Here's what President Trump said about the Club World Cup trophy:

On Sunday, Club World Cup broadcaster DAZN conducted an interview with President Trump, who declared that he was told by FIFA that the trophy originally unveiled at the White House back in March could remain there in perpetuity.

"I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' claimed Trump, before stating that FIFA officials replied, "'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one.' And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now."

FIFA had not previously announced plans to make a second Club World Cup trophy, while Chelsea's official Instagram page included a photo of airplane pilots holding the trophy — replica or not — before the team departed for London.

The Club World Cup trophy seems to have become part of the decor in the Oval Office since Infantino joined Trump to reveal its design to the world. It has been present for some soccer-related moments, like a bizarre event where the president offered his take on world affairs while confused-looking Juventus players stood in the background. However, it has also remained in the Oval Office during moments with no soccer context, lingering in the background as Trump awarded Elon Musk a key to the White House in May, among other instances.

President Donald Trump stood on stage for the FIFA Club World Cup trophy presentation after Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain, 3-0, in Sunday's final. Did he keep the gold trophy?

Chelsea lifted a replica trophy during the FIFA Club World Cup awards ceremony, according to news sources.

The original 24-carat gold-plated gyroscope-like trophy designed designed by FIFA and crafted by Tiffany & Co was presented to Trump by FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a ceremony at the Oval Office.

In an interview with DAZN, the president explained that the original trophy was a gift from FIFA and that Chelsea F.C. held up a replica.

"They (FIFA) said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and (FIFA President Gianni Infantino) said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office'," Trump said. Adding, “And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now (the original) is in the Oval.”

In a viral video from Sunday's award ceremony, Trump is seen tucking a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal in his pocket after all the others were handed out to the winning Chelsea team members. The video appears to show Infantino reaching back for the medal but then gave him a thumbs-up, allowing him to keep the medal.

According to FIFA, the champions receive a replica FIFA Club World Cup trophy featuring the engravings that mark their triumph after the final that they keep permanently and the original is retained by FIFA.

Similarly, the original World Cup trophy is kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zürich, Switzerland, while the World Cup winners receive a gold-plated bronze replica.

However, according to news reports, Trump has claimed that the trophy was a gift from FIFA president Gianni Infantino and is being kept in the Oval Office at the White House.

The FIFA Club World Cup was hosted by the U.S. over the past month, with the final played a MetLife Stadium on July 13.

New York City and Philadelphia are among the cities that will host the FIFA World Cup next summer, with the final again be played at MetLife Stadium.

There is no official confirmation of the original trophy's whereabouts at this time.

Aware of its global impact and the success of the first Club World Cup, Real Madrid made a bold suggestion to FIFA: that the tournament be held every two years.

The information is from The Guardian.

Initially, the competition will be held every four seasons.

The next one is scheduled for 2029, but still without a defined venue - Brazil has already positioned itself as a possibility.

FIFA, in turn, would only consider increasing the number of participating clubs: from 32 to 48.

Real's suggestion was reportedly made during the edition held in the United States.

The team of Xabi Alonso fell in the semifinals by taking a resounding 4 x 0 from the future runner-up PSG.

The performance of the biggest Champions champion in the US was not ideal. But there was plenty of success off the field.

Real alone was responsible for the sale of 25% of the tickets for the World Cup.

One of the focuses of President Florentino Pérez is to secure more revenue for a club that took out a loan of 1.2 billion euros for the renovation of Santiago Bernabéu.

Real wants a World Cup every two years even if it is not guaranteed in the next one.

🤔 Which teams are certain for 2029?

Despite having won the first edition of the Club World Cup, Chelsea does not yet have a guaranteed spot in the next one.

The only European club already certain is PSG, the current Champions League champion.

The four qualifiers are:

Al-Ahli (KSA) - Champion of the Asian Champions League 2024/25

Cruz Azul (MEX) - Champion of the Concacaf Champions Cup 2025

PSG - Champion of the Uefa Champions League 2024/25

Pyramids FC (EGY) - Champion of the CAF Champions League 2024/25

Who can host the World Cup in 2029❓ 

Still according to The Guardian, FIFA is considering more than one venue for the next edition.

The fact that the 2030 World Cup has Spain, Portugal, and Morocco as hosts is an indication that the club tournament may have games in the same countries.

But Portugal has not shown interest.

Qatar, the host of the national teams' World Cup in 2022, has already positioned itself as a possibility.

The same goes for Brazil, the stage in 2014.

FIFA, the governing body for international soccer, gave fans the first look Tuesday morning at the process to buy tickets for the 2026 World Cup.

AT&T Stadium in Arlington will host nine games in the tournament, the most of any of the 16 venues spread across the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Four of the matches in Arlington will be in the knock-out stage of the tournament, including one of the semifinals. For fans in North Texas willing to head a bit farther away, NRG Stadium in Houston will host seven matches.

The tournament starts on Thursday, June 11, with matches in Mexico City and Guadalajara. The first game in Arlington will be on Sunday, June 14.

According to a news release Tuesday morning, FIFA will release the tickets in phases, due to anticipated high demand. Fans can apply to win the chance to buy tickets in the first draw starting on Sept. 10, FIFA said.

"There will be several distinct ticket sales phases from the start of sales on 10 September 2025, through to the final match on Sunday, 19 July 2026. Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products, and full details on each phase will be released in the coming months," the news release said.

FIFA encouraged those interested in tickets to register on its website and create a FIFA ID. "This registration of interest ensures they are made aware of ticketing dates, next steps and processes," FIFA said.

Anyone attending a World Cup game in Arlington will technically have tickets to Dallas Stadium, as World Cup venues are not allowed to use names of their corporate sponsors.

FIFA decided to use the name Dallas Stadium despite the fact that it's located in Arlington, and that does not sit well with the mayor of the Metroplex's third-largest city.

Arlington Mayor Jim Ross told CBS News Texas the venue should be called Arlington Dallas Stadium.

"It's not a dig against Dallas," Ross said. "It's just essential pride of the city of Arlington and what we have accomplished here in our entertainment district ... It's also an economic impact and we want to optimize our ability to take advantage of that."

The Dallas Sports Commission has told Arlington leaders that it will address the issue with FIFA this summer.

U.S. President Donald Trump was seen sneakily pocketing a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal onstage moments before he handed Chelsea a replica trophy.

The president was given the medal to look at by Gianni Infantino while handing others out to the winning squad at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium Sunday. Though videos showed Trump later tucked the medal into his suit blazer when the FIFA CEO seemingly reached for it back.

Infantino appeared to shrug off the incident, flashing the thumbs up and allowing Trump to keep the medal.

Eagle-eyed social media users were quick to react to the clip, which went viral over the weekend and following the game, with one labeling the brazen act “The Art of the Steal.” “He didn't play a minute,” complained another.

It comes after Trump himself revealed that the winner's trophy that he had handed to Chelsea captain Rhys James had actually been a replica, and that FIFA officials had given him the real silverware.

Before the showpiece game, held at the 80,000-seat stadium in New Jersey, Trump told broadcaster DAZN that the real trophy currently sits in the Oval Office, after it was gifted to him by Infantino during a visit in March.

“They said, ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office,” Trump said. “And then I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' He says, ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one.'”

“And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting…It's in the Oval right now,” he added.

Soccer fans, and even the players themselves, were also baffled after the president also made no effort to leave the stage after presenting the fake trophy. Star player Cole Palmer (center left) was seen reacting with astonishment as Trump initially took pride of place (Getty Images)

Soccer fans, and even the players themselves, were also baffled after the president also made no effort to leave the stage after presenting the fake trophy – opting instead to stand and clap alongside them.

Star player Cole Palmer, who scored two of Chelsea's three goals in the victory over Paris St Germaine, was seen reacting with astonishment as Trump initially took pride of place next to James.

In a later interview, Palmer admitted: “I knew he was gonna be there but I didn't know he was gonna be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused.”

Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. (0:52)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is in the books, but even as the dust settles after Chelsea's rout of Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final at MetLife Stadium, preparations for next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup -- hosted across the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19 -- are already well underway. Much of what we saw and experienced of the U.S. as a host nation this summer will inform issues in need of fixing over the next 12 months.

ESPN's reporters who covered the 2025 summer tournament weigh in on the glaring needs FIFA can't afford to ignore if next summer's showpiece sporting event is to be one of its best.

Of all issues that affected the Club World Cup, the weather had the biggest impact on the quality of matches. Manchester City played their first group game at noon in Philadelphia, with no sun coverage, and their second at 9 p.m. in Atlanta's air-conditioned stadium. Afterward, Pep Guardiola talked about the matches as if his team had played two different sports.

The intensity of the performance was certainly different in Atlanta. In Philadelphia, City defender Nathan Aké said the pace of the game against Wydad AC dropped when the clouds opened and the sun came out. The heat was that oppressive.

The issue ahead of the 2026 World Cup is that some teams will have to play in early afternoon matches in places like Miami, where temperatures will reach 90 degrees and higher. With so many games to fit in, there's no other way around it. FIFA can't have all the games kicking off late in the evening at air-conditioned stadiums. It's just not viable.

The biggest question facing FIFA ahead of the World Cup is how to make it fair. England's chances of lifting the trophy will be boosted immeasurably if they play most of their games in covered stadiums like the ones in Atlanta or Houston. On the flip side, if Thomas Tuchel's side are asked to play at lunchtime in Miami, they're going to struggle. Think Brazil in 2014, when England finished bottom of their group and went home early.

By hosting a World Cup in the summer in the U.S., FIFA has already agreed to be hostage to the weather, with both hot/humid conditions and thunderstorms capable of delaying games. But with wildly different conditions in different stadiums and venues, it needs to do everything it can to make the tournament as fair as possible. -- Rob Dawson

Most World Cups have taken place during summer in the Northern hemisphere, which makes a bit of heat and humidity par for the course. However, throw in North America's thunderstorms -- which delay games -- and the impact of the weather is going to be potentially next-level. This is where, off the back of the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA needs to be clever in terms of both venues and kickoff times.

With four games each day from June 13-23 and a whopping eight (in four slots) from June 24-26, it won't be straightforward. But FIFA has several cards to play if it is willing to learn from 2025 and not get overly hung up on kickoff times.

Steve Nicol believes there would be no complaints about the weather if it was the World Cup.

Six of the 16 venues are in relatively temperate climates, while another three are climate-controlled. It seems obvious that if you are going to play in the middle of the day, you should do it in those cities, wherever possible.

As for the stadiums most likely to be affected by the weather? Well, they play at night, and if it means kicking off at 10 p.m. local time, so be it. They do it occasionally in Spain's LaLiga, so they can do it here, too. FIFA has to give itself that option.

Maybe at the Club World Cup, there was a desire to put big clubs in the European prime time to boost TV audiences. Well, FIFA doesn't need to do this for the World Cup because unlike its little sibling, there's no proof of concept needed. History shows folks will stay up into the middle of the night or the early morning (let alone daytime hours at work).

The World Cup does not need to cater to TV. What it does need to do, wherever possible, is give players the best possible conditions to do what they do best. -- Gab Marcotti

The United States is a huge country and one that's accustomed to moving people around by rail, road or air, but there is also a built-in acceptance in the U.S. that stuff happens: weather can cause delays or cancellations, the trains don't run on time and the roads, especially in the big cities, can be chaotic. The system works (with glitches), but it will come under immense strain next summer when the U.S., Mexico and Canada welcome fans for a 48-team World Cup.

The biggest issue will be the capacity for air travel. I personally had three internal flights during the Club World Cup, and they were delayed by three hours, 11 hours and one hour. Stormy weather was the reason for two of them and technical issues the other. There will be some delays that cause fans to miss games.

Such disruptions will affect teams, too. Real Madrid had to cancel their semifinal prematch news conference because bad weather forced their flight to be delayed.

Stewart Robson reacts to the two-hour severe weather delay to Chelsea and Benfica's Club World Cup knockout clash.

Trains? They get you to where you want to go, but don't expect to make the relatively short journey from Manhattan to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in under an hour. And both to and from the Club World Cup final, trains were canceled.

Some stadiums are also way out of town, the Hard Rock in Miami being an example of a ground that is really only accessible by car. Next year will be impacted by travel issues, so prepare to be patient. -- Mark Ogden

For U.S. sports fans who regularly visit some of these stadiums -- whether it's New Jersey's MetLife, Miami's Hard Rock or Pasadena's Rose Bowl -- it goes without saying that arriving and departing is often a long and painful process requiring plenty of patience, planning, and above all, time.

Ask anyone who has attended several games at this tournament and they'll have their own "journey from hell" anecdote. At the Rose Bowl -- which isn't one of the World Cup venues, instead being replaced by Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium -- a number of journalists, including those with international news agencies, arrived at close to halftime in the stadium's debut match, PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, after getting caught up in traffic jams.

At Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, driving or catching an Uber is no guarantee of arriving before kickoff. The stadium's security perimeter -- set up to prevent a repeat of last summer's Copa America chaos -- is so extensive that a long, sweaty walk in Florida's heat and humidity is required anyway to get to your gate. Even the buses provided by FIFA for journalists -- which worked well at most venues, and really should be the blueprint for an expanded program that caters to fans with tickets in 2026 -- suffered long delays after getting stuck in traffic.

Catch the best bits of the footage captured on body cameras worn by referees at the Club World Cup.

MetLife's location in East Rutherford has long been a bone of contention for New Yorkers. Get caught in rush-hour traffic and the journey by road from Manhattan can literally take hours. Kickoff was delayed in the Real Madrid vs. PSG semifinal after even the teams arrived late. And yes, NJ Transit runs a special train service for events, with the station close to the stadium, but that still involves a change -- and sometimes a long wait -- at nearby Secaucus Junction.

Efficiently getting tens of thousands of fans in and out of stadiums at sold-out sporting events is inevitably complicated. But the lack of adequate public transport infrastructure, coupled with some out-of-town locations, for a number of these venues is going to cause a major headache in 2026 unless FIFA provides additional, free shuttle buses running frequently for fans. -- Alex Kirkland

PSG coach Luis Enrique said Seattle's Lumen Field resembled an "NBA court full of holes" before doubling down by adding that the "ball bounces like a rabbit." Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham said the pitches in general "aren't great at all ... [and] tough on the knees as well. Hopefully someone will look at that going into the World Cup next year."

FIFA needs to. After all, this wave of frustration follows on from criticism of the surfaces used during last year's Copa America, including Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez labelling the Mercedes-Benz Stadium pitch in Atlanta a "disaster."

Five of the venues used at the Club World Cup -- Lumen Field, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field -- will be employed at next summer's World Cup, and there is clearly work still to be done. They are NFL stadiums using artificial turf, incompatible with FIFA's requirement that all its competitions are played on entirely natural grass surfaces. The Club World Cup was an experiment in that regard, as FIFA tried to innovate new techniques to create a hybrid surface, including transporting Bermuda grass overnight in refrigerated trucks to improve the quality.

Furthermore, while many participants complained about the extreme temperatures, stadiums with roofs make it harder to grow and maintain real grass with natural sunlight. Four of the 16 venues next summer -- Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver -- have roofs.

"We'll report after this tournament and take lessons forward to 2026," said MetLife pitch venue manager Blair Christensen at the tournament's conclusion. "These guys here that work on the pitch with me, they are far sharper and better than they were 35 days ago, and we'll take that forward to next year." -- James Olley

Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup.

The 2025 Club World Cup saw 32 teams from around the globe participate in an extensive competition under extreme conditions, facing intense heat, logging thousands of miles in travel across the United States between games and playing on makeshift pitches to replace artificial grass in certain venues.

While Major League Soccer players entered the competition amid the ongoing 2025 campaign, and with fresher legs given that their offseason runs from early December to late February, most clubs were forced to play just weeks after grueling campaigns: all four Brazilian teams (Flamengo, Palmeiras, Fluminense, Botafogo) had played 70 or more games, with Chelsea and Manchester City clocking in with 57 across all competitions. Exhaustion often showed in the performances, leading to forced substitutions, concern for injuries and, at times, an arguably less intense level of football on the pitch.

It's not over for these players either, with MLS clubs returning to their regular season and European clubs preparing for the 2025-26 campaign. With just one year until the 2026 World Cup, players and clubs missed out on a crucial summer break, and they must now balance avoiding injuries and playing time while still being competitive, with players keen to earn a spot in their national team's roster. We have yet to see whether this tournament will have consequences. Once participating players kick off the 2025-26 campaign and weekly action is underway, players might begin to experience the Club World Cup's lasting impact. -- Lizzy Becherano

Not for the first time in his life, U.S. President Donald Trump ensured that he was the center of attention.

Much to the bemusement of Chelsea's celebratory players, Trump planted himself in the heart of the blue scrum as Reece James eventually hoisted the Club World Cup trophy aloft. However, according to Trump himself, James and his teammates were celebrating with a replica, rather than the real thing.

The trophy, which shifts from a flat plate to a golden spiral with the twist of a special key, is the pride and joy of FIFA President Gianni Infantino, whose name happens to be carved into the piece of silverware (twice).

During his shameless promotion tour of the newly expanded competition's inaugural outing, Infantino spent plenty of time buttering up the host nation's president. The trophy's first outing was in the White House's Oval Office back in March, an occasion which saw Trump hail Infantino as “the king of soccer, I guess, in a certain way”.

Infantino may be the king, but Trump always reserves top billing for himself. The real Club World Cup trophy made by Tiffany & Co. has remained at the White House since that event in March.

“I said, When are you going to pick up the trophy? [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one,'” Trump told DAZN during the Club World Cup final. “And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”

Footage from the post-match ceremony also appeared to show Trump pocketing one of the winners' medals.

This summer's Club World Cup acted as a forerunner to next summer's international men's World Cup which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. “It's about unity,” Trump said about the upcoming competition. “It's about everybody getting together and a lot of love between countries. I guess this is probably the most international sport, so it can really bring the world together.”

Chelsea FC defeated PSG in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup tournament — which featured several games played in Philadelphia — but might that have been the last chance soccer fans here to see the world's greatest players?

Philadelphia is set to be one of the host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but there is a very real chance that FIFA skips America altogether next year.

Will FIFA pull out? Here's what we know.

According to ESPN, there have been enough complaints about the summertime heat across America to cause FIFA players, coaches and the FIFPRO worldwide soccer players' union that FIFA is considering relocating the 2026 World Cup from America.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to begin on Thursday, June 11 and will conclude on Sunday, July 19.

"We clearly believe that from a health and safety perspective, this (extreme heat) is something that must take priority over commercial interests with regards to the safety of the players," said FIFPRO spokesperson Alexander Bielefeld in comments included in ESPN's report. "Heat conditions are not happening in a vacuum. The debate on extreme heat is not happening in a vacuum. It's actually quite foreseeable."

ESPN also noted that FIFPRO executives suggested canceling FIFA Club World Cup matches in Philadelphia due to the heat, as temperatures went beyond their threshold of 82.4 degrees on the WetBulb Globe Temperature gauge.

According to WeatherSpark, the average temperature in Philadelphia for late June is around 87 degrees.

However, a separate report indicates FIFA officials haven't yet decided to pull the 2026 World Cup from America.

As it stands, Lincoln Financial Field in South Philadelphia is set to host six 2026 FIFA World Cup matches.

Ex-Manchester United star Louis Saha has explained why Cristiano Ronaldo will “definitely want Lionel Messi to join him in Saudi Arabia”.

Two eternal rivals with 13 Ballons d'Or between them once locked horns on a regular basis when competing on opposing sides of the fierce Clasico divide that exists between La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.

They have headed their separate ways since then, with Ronaldo recently extending his record-breaking contract in the Middle East with Al-Nassr. Messi, meanwhile, is turning out for Inter Miami in MLS.

He is yet to extend his deal there, despite having an option for 2026, and there has been talk of big-spending teams in the Saudi Pro League readying another approach for the Argentine GOAT.

Saha believes that CR7 would like to see a deal done, with the Portuguese superstar's former Old Trafford team-mate telling BoyleSports - who offer the latest Champions League betting: “Will Cristiano Ronaldo want Lionel Messi to join him in Saudi Arabia? Definitely. Cristiano will want more big players out there and it's starting to get very competitive, we have seen that in the Club World Cup.

“The people in Saudi will want to continue making the league as big as they can. Ronaldo is a competitor and he wants to win, he hasn't won trophies like he would want out there. It would be nice to see the competition within the competition.”

Al-Ahli are the team said to have an offer for Messi ready to go, with the World Cup winner having previously snubbed interest from that part of the world when deciding to go chasing the American dream in 2023.

Lionel Messi is being backed to complete an emotional homecoming transfer to Newell's Old Boys, amid questions of his future at Inter Miami.

Argentine GOAT Messi is yet to extend a contract in South Florida that is due to expire at the end of the 2025 MLS campaign. He does have the option for another 12 months in the United States, taking him through the next World Cup finals.

Inter Miami remain hopeful that a deal can be done there, but Messi is seeing moves elsewhere mooted. Teams in the Saudi Pro League are reportedly ready to reunite the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner with eternal rival and Al-Nassr talisman Cristiano Ronaldo.

A return to where it all began is also being speculated on, with Messi having never shied away from the fact that he would like to make a competitive appearance for Newell's before the day comes to hang up record-breaking boots for the final time.

Close friend and fellow world champion Angel Di Maria has made a similar move, with the veteran winger heading back to Rosario Central at 37 years of age. Claudio Tapia, who was present for Di Maria's unveiling in familiar surroundings, believes Messi could tread the same path.

Argentine FA president Tapia told TNT Sports when asked if Messi will one day return to his homeland and bring a remarkable career full circle: "I hope so." Newell's boss Cristian Fabbiani has previously stated that he would like to bring Messi home on a four-month contract.

Messi has offered little indication as to what his long-term future will hold, with the South American superstar currently enjoying a history-making run of form in MLS that has seen him bag a brace in five consecutive matches.

Liverpool are keen on signing a new No.9 to bolster their attack ahead of the 2025-26 campaign. The Reds have prioritised having a fearsome frontline in the last few seasons, with more than one option in each of the three positions upfront. Alexander Isak is one of five players on Liverpool's radar to slot into the central striker berth next season.

Galatasaray have rejected Napoli's new transfer conditions for Victor Osimhen to leave him stuck in limbo. The Turkish giants have refused to meet the fresh demands laid down by the Italian champions, putting Premier League clubs on red alert. Osimhen is being strongly linked with a move away from Napoli this summer after he spent a year on loan in Turkey, becoming the top goalscorer in the Super Lig.

The Blues' FIFA Club World Cup exploits have set them up for future success, with their No.10 the main man in the BlueCo project

"Everyone has talked a lot of sh*t about us all season," a carefree Cole Palmer so characteristically proclaimed after Chelsea were crowned champions of the world on Sunday. "But I feel like we're going in the right direction." The Blues didn't just beat Paris Saint-Germain, the consensus best team in the world, but absolutely smashed them in the first final of the revamped FIFA Club World Cup, running out 3-0 victors at MetLife Stadium.

Chelsea weren't given much of a fighting chance heading into the showdown in New Jersey. Their run throughout the tournament, compared to the gauntlet that PSG faced, was derided as one more reminiscent of their Conference League campaign. When Levi Colwill and captain Reece James expressed their confidence pre-match, there were claims of 'delusion' thrown their way.

Yet here we are in a reality where Chelsea are basking in the golden glow of world domination, again. The club is in a very different position to the last time they won the Club World Cup in 2022, but are still winners all the same. The critical noises surrounding BlueCo have quietened, and that's largely down to their project's star man.

Palmer scored two of Chelsea's three goals and assisted the other for Joao Pedro inside 43 first-half minutes. He was the tactical wrinkle that not even the great Luis Enrique could iron out, his fingerprints all over the game as PSG were tossed to-and-fro by the west Londoners. Now that he has silverware in his cabinet and enough credit in the bank, we can start talking about Palmer in grander terms.

Connections: Sports Edition

It was “the best v the best”, it was “the worst idea ever implemented in football”. It delivered showstopping games and some rank attendances. It endured extreme heatwaves and storm delays. Its riches were fought for fiercely by clubs, who also fear “disaster” seasons ahead. And it ended with U.S. President Donald Trump sharing the podium with eventual champions Chelsea.

Yes, it's fair to say the newly-expanded 2025 Club World Cup was a football tournament unlike any other.

Here a selection of The Athletic's writers on the ground in U.S. reflect on the best and worst of the event, what impact it may have on the season ahead, what it suggests the 2026 World Cup will be like and what should change before it is staged again.

James Horncastle: I enjoyed seeing a relaxed Pep Guardiola playing on the beach with his Manchester City players. It needed to be cut like a Top Gun montage with some Kenny Loggins music. The fact Loggins, a master of the 80s movie soundtrack, was overlooked as one of the musical ambassadors for this tournament feels like a missed opportunity.

Oliver Kay: I can't claim to have witnessed it myself, but I walked through Times Square so many times over the past week that I would like to think it happened under my nose and I didn't see it. It was that video of Cole Palmer wobbling awkwardly on a scooter, through the crowds, pretty much unnoticed, in one of the world's biggest tourist spots, where there's a giant billboard with his image on it. I love his ability on the pitch, as showcased in the final, and I love his authenticity off it.

Jordan Campbell: Thiago Silva channeling his inner Al Pacino. The Fluminense captain delivered a stirring speech to his team-mates about not leaving things for later as tomorrow is not promised. It inspired the Brazilian side to a shock 2-0 win over Inter Milan and they then went on to beat City's conquerors Al Hilal to make the semi-finals. It was a moment that emphasised how big a role leadership still plays in the sport and captured the significance of this competition to the South Americans.

Mario Cortegana: From a purely footballing point of view, Al Hilal's victory against Manchester City. It was a very beautiful game, with a lot of drama, and left us with surely the biggest surprise of the tournament. It was also a warning of what Saudi football can or intends to do ahead of the World Cup they will host in 2034.

I also really enjoyed being able to watch live and from so close (in Valdebebas they put us far away!) the first training sessions of Xabi Alonso and his staff at the helm of Real Madrid. It is very different from what we were used to with Carlo Ancelotti since 2021.

Felipe Cardenas: When Boca Juniors fans took over Miami and then turned Hard Rock Stadium into a modern version of La Bombonera. With Bayern Munich as the opponent, it was Boca's moment to shine under the global spotlight. The stadium shook, the chanting never stopped. Miguel Merentiel's equaliser amounted to absolute bedlam. Boca fans sang the entire game and cried tears of joy even after the loss.

Jeff Rueter: For all of the atmosphere created by their fans, Boca Juniors left much to be desired with their onfield performance. That shouldn't tarnish the achievement of Auckland City, taking a point off of Boca to close the group stage. For the only amateur team in the field to get a result against any team, much less one of the world's most ubiquitous legacy clubs, is the sort of game that only an event like this can create.

Mark Carey: Leaning into the Americanisms of this tournament, I found it funny that legendary boxing announcer Michael Buffer screamed: “Let's get ready to rumble!” ahead of both semi-finals and the final. Having each player enter the pitch individually in their own respective “ring walk” is one thing, but come on — that is too much. I found it entertaining, but not necessarily for the right reasons.

Liam Twomey: This tournament will not go down as a high point in the history of the football fan experience, but the South American supporters had the best time. One memory that will always stick with me was seeing — and smelling — the Brazilian barbecue tailgate parties that Flamengo fans had in the car parks outside Lincoln Financial Field before and after their win over Chelsea. FIFA will want to see more of that fusion of local and American culture at the World Cup next year.

Asli Pelit: I loved watching a handful of beloved South American teams bring that unmistakable garra Sudamericana back to a sport increasingly warped by sovereign funds, private equity, and billionaire ownership. A handful of players from these clubs also reminded me that no matter how old a player is (nor how many times he's bounced between Europe's elite clubs) when they come back home to retire swiftly, there's still joy in the fight. Shout out to Thiago Silva for proving it's never just a farewell tour.

And the fans. Not the casuals who swap jerseys like yesterday's gym shirts, but the die-hards, the ones who live for their club, who travel across continents, and who chant through the scorching sun until their legs give out. They made me remember why I do this. Why I still love this game, even when so much of it feels lost.

James Horncastle: When the Oval Office became a mixed zone and Donald Trump spoke about the Middle East and then turned and asked a bemused set of Juventus players: “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” A club nicknamed the Old Lady has rarely looked so uncomfortable amid stately locker-room talk.

Jordan Campbell: The tears of Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves, Diogo Jota's best friend, as a minute's silence was held for the Liverpool forward. As the game started, both of them were visibly still trying to trick their brains into game mode, but how could they? It was heartbreaking to watch. In that moment, it showed that the melodrama that tends to come with football is exactly that.

Mark Carey: The pain of seeing current, and former, team-mates do their best to hold their emotions together during a moment's reflection for Diogo Jota is a memory that will not go away in a hurry. How they found the strength to think about kicking a football after recent events is beyond comprehension.

Oliver Kay: I agree with Mark. Not directly Club World Cup-related, but it was waking up in Atlanta to the tragic news about Diogo Jota and Andre Silva and then seeing and feeling what a profound effect that had on the whole tournament and the whole sport. It still doesn't seem real.

Jeff Rueter: Gianni Infantino and Juventus' appearance at the White House was particularly catastrophic coming a day before the U.S.'s air strikes in Iran, with reporters posing questions about Trump's plans while Infantino watched on. Mind you, Iran qualified for the 2026 World Cup in March. For an organization that went to great lengths to keep politics away from the last instalment in Qatar, it was a flagrant instance of hypocrisy.

Mario Cortegana: Real Madrid's painful semi-final defeat against PSG, in which the best thing for Los Blancos was the result (4-0). This thrashing has restored some worries inside and outside the team when it seemed that the arrival of Alonso had changed that.

Liam Twomey: Sadly I fear this is doomed to become the defining image of Infantino's inaugural expanded FIFA Club World Cup: a beaming President Trump keeping himself front and centre of Chelsea's trophy lift at MetLife Stadium, generating the most emphatic visual riposte possible to the notion that sport can ever be kept separate from politics.

Felipe Cardenas: Hard to argue against the politicization of the Club World Cup. It was blatant and completely unnecessary. I will say that seeing Jamal Musiala's leg break in person (even from a distance in the press tribune) was heartbreaking. In Qatar three years ago, Musiala was a 19-year-old phenom and arguably one of the tournament's best players. Now his injury has put his participation at the next World Cup at risk.

Asli Pelit: There is a creeping Americanization of football, no one asked for and no one needs, least of all at something like the Club World Cup which is supposedly happening to make casual fans love and understand the sport. We don't need player-by-player intros and we definitely don't need “Let's get ready to Rumble” echoing across a football pitch. The beauty of this sport is in its existing rituals, its global soul, not in theatrics borrowed from sports that stop every 10 seconds for commercials. Keep the gimmicks out. Let football be football.

James Horncastle: Angel Di Maria. I still don't think enough is made of how important this guy is to Argentine football. He got the gold medal goal in the 2008 Olympic final, the only goal in the 2021 Copa America final and scored in the 2022 World Cup final. It was a privilege to watch him play his last games for a European team before heading home to Rosario Central.

Jordan Campbell: Since Fluminense winger Jhon Arias has gone from hipster to mainstream (and maybe Wolves) I shall avoid naming the Colombian. Ruben Neves' pinpoint passing and set-piece delivery was a joy to witness for Al Hilal, while Palmer is just so imaginative that he excites every time he gets on the ball. But, even after all these years, it was still Lionel Messi. The narrative that he is no longer an elite player is lazy. Of course he has faded but there were very few players who proved they are clearly above him in his ability to dominate a game. Playing alongside players way below his level, he carried Inter Miami and even against PSG he had a dozen moments where he showed why his brain works differently to everyone else.

Oliver Kay: I share Jordan's enduring love of watching Messi, as well as Palmer. But unlike Jordan, I'm not too cool to have been anything other than spellbound by Fluminense's Arias. What a player: so skilful, so creative, so clever but also so direct in what he does. I would love to see how he fares in Premier League if he does join Wolves, but I kind of love the fact that he's 27, at the peak of his powers, and still playing in South America.

Mark Carey: I enjoyed Arda Guler dropping into a deeper role and dictating Real Madrid's build-up from deep. Guler has struggled for regular minutes since moving to Spain, but was billed as an heir to Luka Modric by Ancelotti before he left the club. It looks like next season will be the biggest of the 20-year-old's career under Alonso.

Mario Cortegana: Gonzalo Garcia. Even for those of us who follow the Real Madrid academy, his emergence has been impressive. It's not normal for a kid from Castilla (Madrid's reserve team) who had only played 61 minutes this season under Ancelotti to have taken advantage of injuries to Kylian Mbappe and Endrick in this way, with four goals and an assist in six games. And his impact has gone beyond this very good data: we must highlight his defensive work, his reading of the game, the feeling he puts into each play…. The best summary of his tournament is that Alonso compared him to club legend Raul.

Jeff Rueter: Nottingham Forest fans should feel bullish about Igor Jesus's chances of acclimating to the Premier League. With Botafogo, the 24-year-old showed clever movement to pair with his immense physicality to win headers and create separation in the box. Having earned four caps for Brazil since debuting in October, he'll be determined to make the World Cup roster.

Felipe Cardenas: I thought that none of us were going to pick Arias. Well done, Oli. No one, and I mean no one, was able to take the ball off of the Colombian. His low center of gravity and apparent casual way of transporting the ball around the pitch is so impressive. However, I covered PSG multiple times during the tournament and came away as a fan of both Desire Doue and Bradley Barcola. Both players are street-ball type dribblers that any football fan would enjoy watching.

Liam Twomey: No player made a bigger impact on the business end of this Club World Cup than Joao Pedro. The Brazilian was on holiday when Chelsea signed him from Brighton & Hove Albion during the mid-tournament player registration window, but his holidays are clearly nowhere near as indulgent as mine. He arrived in prime shape and immediately transformed Chelsea's attack, providing a clinical edge to Enzo Maresca's possession play with two brilliant goals in the semi-final win over Fluminense and one more in the final against PSG. Given the riches on offer at this tournament, he has already repaid his transfer fee.

Asli Pelit: Ousmane Dembele. His football IQ and spatial understanding were remarkable. I don't know what happened to him at the final but until then, he was brilliant and a joy to watch.

James Horncastle: I'd expect everyone to say Boca, and with good reason. Bayern's captured some of the sentiment with their banner at the Auckland City game. “Ten years Baur au Lac. World football is more poorly governed than before. Smash FIFA!” I'm going to go with the fans who actually turned up for the Mamelodi Sundowns-Ulsan game in Orlando. To be one of the 3,000 that felt like 300, now that's hardcore.

Jordan Campbell: Flamengo. It is difficult to decide between them, Palmeiras and Botafogo but, from what I witnessed, Flamengo showed why they have the biggest fan base in Brazil. They turned out in swathes and organised themselves at games so that it felt like a domestic setting with blocks of red generating the best buzz of the live games I witnessed. An honourable mention must go to the estimated 15,000 Saudis who were in Orlando to see Al Hilal beat Manchester City as they were seriously boisterous.

Oliver Kay: Urawa Red Diamonds' fans were amazing. I loved the constant singing, the bouncing up and down, and the overall commitment to supporting their team and enjoying the experience, thousands of miles from home, when they were losing every game. They even did that wonderfully Japanese thing of cleaning up the terraces after themselves. I had a nice chat with a couple of their fans in Charlotte. They'd bought tickets for a knockout game there in anticipation of winning the group. They agreed that was hilarious.

Mark Carey: The Brazilian fans have had such rave reviews, and I agree. I watched Palmeiras twice in the flesh, and their fans did not stop bouncing the whole game from behind the goal. When Paulinho scored an extra-time winner against Botafogo? Bedlam. Unlike anything I have seen in England.

Felipe Cardenas: Supporters for every Brazilian club really showed out during the tournament. I'll add River Plate's fans as well. Perhaps they weren't given the credit they feel they deserve. River played all three group matches on the West Coast of the U.S., which for River fans and some pundits in Argentina, was a slap in the face. ‘How dare they put Boca in Miami and River in Seattle?', they argued. But still, Los Millonarios didn't make headlines with their traveling band of loyalists, but they were well supported in a part of the country that wasn't as accessible for their fans.

Mario Cortegana: From what I have been able to experience live, those of Real Madrid. Several players actually expressed that it was almost like playing at home. From what I have seen and heard on television, I would highlight the Argentines, above all, and the Brazilians.

Jeff Rueter: It's one thing to travel around the world to follow a tournament favourite. For fans who made the trip to catch the field's lesser-followed clubs, like the Mamelodi Sundowns-Ulsan match as well as those of Auckland City, it seemed like an unforgettable chance to see their teams play on a global stage.

Liam Twomey: Flamengo's supporters were the best I saw in person, both in terms of numbers and volume, and I was fortunate enough to see them twice. A word of acknowledgement for the fans of Esperance de Tunis, however, who brought their songs and their drums to Philadelphia and never allowed their spirit to be dampened even as Chelsea ruthlessly dispatched their team.

Asli Pelit: I spent most of the tournament with Fluminense and Palmeiras fans: pure passion, non-stop music, the kind of energy that makes you feel alive. But when it comes to sheer fandom, Boca fans in Miami and Los Millonarios out on the West Coast put everyone else to shame. You could feel it through the screen, even with DAZN's spotty coverage trying its best to ruin the vibe.

James Horncastle: I enjoyed a lot of the football at this tournament. It wasn't played at a pre-season pace. If it looked like it did at times that was a consequence of the heat. Manchester City-Al Hilal stands out. Mamelodi-Borussia Dortmund was great fun and there were some good 0-0s, notably Sergio Ramos' Monterrey against River Plate, which was studs up and guards down; a Street Fighter arcade.

Jordan Campbell: Manchester City 3-4 Al Hilal. It had everything. The Saudi side refusing to kick off until the Venezuelan referee (called Valenzuela) checked the VAR monitor (he didn't), a goalkeeping clinic from Yassine Bounou, Malcom becoming the world-class player many believed he would for half an hour and, after a late extra-time winner, a major upset. Don't forget the geopolitics, either. It was one of those rare games that once it burst into life, literally anything could have happened and it would not have been a surprise. Utter chaos.

Oliver Kay: The most enthralling game was Al Hilal's 4-3 victory over Manchester City, as others have said, but I also really enjoyed PSG's 2-0 win over Bayern in Atlanta. It was outstanding, lots of drama and high-quality performances on both sides. It wouldn't have looked out of place in the Champions League knock-out round — which, although Infantino won't like this, remains the gold standard for club football.

Mark Carey: Not just because I was lucky to see the game live, but PSG's dismantling of Real Madrid was nothing short of the perfect performance. Luis Enrique's side made Madrid look like a European minnow, bagging three goals before we had reached half an hour. A 4-0 victory was actually a mercy, as PSG took their foot off the gas in the second half in the scorching New Jersey heat.

Mario Cortegana: Although it could also be the PSG-Real Madrid, I'll take the Manchester City 3-4 Al Hilal. The result was a surprise, the game was a rollercoaster, there were so many goals and it went all the way to extra time. The reactions and the faces of Guardiola and his players also showed how much they cared.

Jeff Rueter: Botafogo's 1-0 upset of PSG and Flamengo's ensuing 3-1 win over Chelsea provided this tournament with its proof of concept that teams from beyond Europe could spring surprises. Botafogo's win saw Renato Paiva concoct a bold scheme, defending with an aggressively advancing defensive line to limit PSG's space. And, in true “big club” fashion, Botafogo fired Paiva after a round of 16 exit. So it goes.

Felipe Cardenas: Aside from Musiala's horror injury, the PSG-Bayern clash was, as they say, a proper football match. Both sides were absolutely going for it, with the French champions admitting the day prior that revenge was on their minds. PSG had not forgotten a loss they suffered at the Allianz Arena in November of 2024 during the Champions League. Before over 65,000 people in Atlanta, this European battle was tactical, attacking and full of dramatic moments. PSG eliminated Bayern 2-0 with nine men. It was an incredible theatre.

Liam Twomey: At the risk of being skewed by the matches I attended, I'll go for Bayern's 4-2 win over Flamengo in Miami. Filipe Luis' side played the best football of any non-European team at this tournament and after a horrendous opening 10 minutes they really turned the screws on Bayern, who were rescued ultimately by the clinical finishing of Harry Kane.

Asli Pelit: Echoing Jeff, I loved how Flamengo and Botafogo beat Chelsea and PSG unexpectedly in the group stages. I love a good underdog story in football. Monterrey vs Inter Milan was also a good one.

James Horncastle: Better. Of course, it'll be better than this tournament. But it will also be disrupted, it'll be hot, expensive, knackering and the U.S. and its cities are so sprawling I think there will still be times when you ask yourself: is a major tournament going on here? I left the Club World Cup seeing cracks in the facade of America as the greatest place on earth to experience live events.

Mark Carey: Hot. You can improve things elsewhere — you can even have a bigger PR push to get more fans in the stadium — but you cannot change the weather conditions. In club football, established patterns of play means that players can adapt tactically to the conditions a little more, but internationally you are not afforded that same time to work on those ideas. Therefore, next summer could be quite an attritional tournament.

Jordan Campbell: Peripheral. I say that because while I think the football at the Club World Cup itself was a success, it just never seemed to be the centre of attention in any city. It didn't help that it was competing for attention with the Gold Cup, NFL, NBA and MLB but I'm not sure you can truly have a captive audience spread across three different countries. Major tournaments are supposed to feel like the centre of the universe for a few weeks . The World Cup is the biggest prize in the sports world but there were regular challenges in trying to find bars who knew the tournament was happening, or who were prepared to show it on one of their million screens. It could make the whole thing seem a little numbing next summer.

Oliver Kay: Big … and hot … and possibly chaotic. The past four weeks have barely scratched the surface of next summer's potential, but the World Cup will be a different matter. It will be spread out across three countries, but I think it will really resonate in the host cities, with so many more fans arriving from overseas. There'll be more pressure on airlines and public transport, that is for sure.

Mario Cortegana: There is plenty of room for improvement, though I have my doubts over how much will change. It is clear that the weather has been a very negative factor, as well as the quality of the grass (although I expected more serious injuries and thankfully there were few). Ticket sales, prices and the press facilities also left much to be desired.

Jeff Rueter: More “business as usual” than spectacular. Don't get me wrong: a World Cup will always break away from the churn of the sport's routine, and there's no like-for-like comparison to be found against the Club World Cup. Still, there's a bit of big event fatigue settling in for ticket-buying fans, players, coaches and stadium staff. From the 2024 Copa América to this Club World Cup — plus the looming 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles — the world's biggest tournament just feels like the latest in a litany of biggest tournaments.

Felipe Cardenas: Overwhelming. The cross-country travel, 48 teams and their supporters, an aviation industry that's understaffed and under fire will all become significant factors. I agree with James that this Club World Cup, while described as a 2026 dress rehearsal, cemented the fact that the U.S. still has work to do as the host of a major football tournament. The Copa America last summer broke open the cracks in the infrastructure that Americans so often boast about.

Liam Twomey: Slower to gain momentum. Even in a Club World Cup group stage that sagged at times, the performances of the South American teams created some fun early intrigue. A 32-team tournament maintained some semblance of urgency; now imagine a format which requires an entire group stage to go from 48 to 32 teams. There will be more interest in next summer's World Cup, but more boredom early on too.

Asli Pelit: Here's my wish list for next year: More cooling stations around stadiums. If noon kickoffs are non-negotiable, then keeping fans hydrated and safe in 110-degree heat isn't optional. People need shade structures and water fountains. And while we're at it: simplify public transportation to the stadiums. No one should need a GPS, a prayer, and three train transfers just to get to a game.

James Horncastle: The participants will be late back, less rested and more injury-prone. People still haven't realised AFCON is in January and it clashes with the expanded Champions League. PSG aside, I wonder how many of the teams involved will win their domestic league.

Jordan Campbell: From speaking to performance and fitness coaches in the Premier League a few months back, those not working at a club competing at this tournament have thanked their lucky stars. They believe it is a logistical nightmare as a three-to-four week gap either side of the tournament does not allow enough time for proper recovery and a full pre-season, meaning it is likely that some players will come in undercooked and take time to get going or could be overcooked and trail off, potentially due to injuries, as the season wears on.

Oliver Kay: I honestly don't know yet because it's such an unknown. I felt pre-tournament that it could really undermine Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid etc, because no sports scientist would recommend the kind of summer they have had. It might actually work in the opposite way and benefit in the short term, but I think the effects will be felt more in the medium term. Even if they battle on through to May, how many of these players will be in peak condition for the World Cup?

Mark Carey: Actually not that much. I do not agree with FIFA flogging players with too many games at all, but I don't think this summer's tournament will have a tangible impact on the outcome of next season. If there were one thing, it should put more onus on managers rotating their squads a little at the start of the campaign, but otherwise I think its influence will be negligible.

Mario Cortegana: Madrid, the Spanish club to go furthest, will have a three-week vacation, so I don't expect a big impact. I was expecting more in terms of injuries during the tournament, as it was stretching an already very demanding season by almost a month. I do think it could have more damage on clubs in leagues that start the competition earlier.

Jeff Rueter: To Mark's point, I'm very curious if it will be remembered more than a few months from now. Given its branding, one would think this should be a major pillar of the 2025 calendar year. But will Ballon d'Or voters really give outsized considerations to performances in this Club World Cup? Or will this be treated as little more than the most lavish preseason tournament in history for European clubs?

Liam Twomey: It's hard to imagine their Club World Cup exertions helping Chelsea from a physical perspective next season. They're going on holiday while all of their Premier League rivals build up the conditioning that is vital to sustain a 10-month campaign. On the other hand, the collective confidence this triumph — and particularly the manner of their win over PSG — will give everyone at Chelsea could be genuinely transformative.

Felipe Cardenas: Player welfare will remain a talking point and players, coaches, fans and pundits will refer to the Club World Cup as one reason the players may look fatigued in 2025-26. On the flip side, the competition did prepare teams for their trophy quests. When the Copa Libertadores and Champions League rolls around (and other domestic and international tournaments), perhaps we'll see more battle-tested personalities from teams who were in the competition this summer.

James Horncastle: Be less about Infantino, although I understand why this edition was about him. It was the first and it is his baby. So much of the focus was on him and whether or not the tournament worked. There were no other narratives to fall back on. In time, that will change as was the case with the World Cup through the 1930s and 1950s and the European Cup into the 1960s and 1970s.

Jordan Campbell: Lean into continental rivalry. It billed itself as ‘best vs best' and gave many a stick to beat it with after a 10-0 in the second game but the competitiveness of this tournament showed that there is a concept worth pursuing. The South American pride coming up against the wealth of Europe was a strong narrative throughout with all the cultural and stylistic differences it brings. If the Saudi Pro League can provide a few of the Asian representatives in 2029 there should be a third pole capable of competing.

Oliver Kay: See revenue distributed in a way that genuinely benefits the game, rather than just the richest clubs in each region. Before the tournament, Infantino lamented how, in modern football, “the elite is very concentrated in very few clubs, in very countries”, which is certainly true. And yet more than $300million of an (absurd) $1billion prize fund will be split between Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. If Infantino genuinely thinks this helps football's financial inequalities, rather than compounds them, then he hasn't learned much from his time at UEFA. If a huge prize pool was the only way to make it attractive to the biggest clubs, then what does that tell us about the tournament?

Advertisement

Mark Carey: Have better playing surfaces. It has been widely spoken about, but the bounce of the ball — or lack thereof — has been notable from the television coverage, never mind from the perspective of the players. Considering this is being pitched so favourably by Infantino, the very least you should expect in future is a pitch that is befitting of the elite level. This would be a major step forward.

Mario Cortegana: Selling this tournament as if everything has been rosy may have felt necessary to FIFA for the first edition, but for the next one I hope they leave that a little behind. I also hope that during these years they show real interest in improving the schedules to protect professionals and fans from the heat or the quality of the pitches.

Jeff Rueter: Have some sense about kick-off slots. Mid-afternoon games in the American summer looked unnecessarily gruelling. With apologies to my friends in Europe who could catch games in primetime, it did a disservice to players and fans alike.

Asli Pelit: I've got a long list of suggestions echoing my colleagues who touched upon my concerns above. But maybe the place to start is simply asking players and fans: do they even want this tournament to continue? Before expanding formats and squeezing in more fixtures, maybe ask whether we actually need yet another tournament.

Liam Twomey: Make player welfare a bigger consideration than maximising viewer numbers. It feels mildly miraculous that we reached the end of this tournament without a significant player health scare on the pitch, given the brutality of the heat inside many stadiums.

Felipe Cardenas: Never use Freed from Desire as the tournament's soundtrack ever again. I used to like that song.

Sergio Marchi likens Infantino to Roman emperor Nero

He says staging was reminiscent of ‘bread and circuses'

The president of Fifpro has described the Club World Cup as a “fiction” and compared Gianni Infantino to the Roman emperor Nero, as the dispute between the players' union and Fifa continued to escalate.

Sergio Marchi joined the ranks of those critical of Infantino's expanded tournament, saying a “lack of protection” for players had left the Club World Cup equivalent to “bread and circuses”.

It is understood Fifpro was not invited to a meeting regarding player welfare held by Infantino in New York on the eve of the final, won 3-0 by Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain.

Marchi said the Club World Cup was not without its strengths because it had “generated enthusiasm among numerous fans and allowed some of the world's leading figures to be seen in a single tournament”, but he said it did not represent football well.

“Fifpro cannot fail to point out, with absolute clarity, that this competition hides a dangerous disconnect with the true reality experienced by most footballers around the world,” he said. “What was presented as a global celebration of football was nothing more than a fiction created by Fifa, promoted by its president, without dialogue, sensitivity and respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts.

“A grandiloquent staging inevitably reminiscent of the ‘bread and circuses' of Nero's Rome, entertainment for the masses while behind the scenes inequality, precariousness and the lack of protection for the true protagonists deepen.”

Those “true protagonists” are the players, including those of Chelsea and PSG who will start their new league seasons five weeks after the final.

Last month Fifpro urged Fifa to grant players a four-week rest between seasons. This request has not been taken up, however, with the meeting on Saturday ending with an agreement that three weeks of rest would be sufficient. “There is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period/holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season,” Fifa said.

Fifpro is part of a group of football bodies, including the Premier League, pursuing legal action against Fifa over an alleged lack of consultation regarding the Club World Cup and changes to the international match calendar more broadly.

FifaThe global governing body has said it is “fully within our rights to set the parameters of our competitions whilst respecting the regulatory framework in place”, and the prospect of a legal row was described by Infantino as “futile”.

Fifa said there had been agreement during the meeting at the weekend that the calendar needed to “strike the right balance between national team football and club football, on the one hand, and between domestic, continental, and global club competitions, on the other hand”. The Club World Cup is the only global club competition. Fifa has been approached for comment.

The 23-year-old American tennis star has jumped to World No. 7 in WTA rankings.

Amanda Anisimova had the best Grand Slam finish of her career at The Wimbledon Championships, and though she fell short to Iga Świątek in the final, the American tennis star is taking away some unmatched memories and lessons for her next major of the season.

"It was such a remarkable experience for me, and making it to the first Grand Slam final and it being at Wimbledon was a surreal feeling," the 23-year-old said in a new interview with "Good Morning America."

"Even though it didn't go the way I would have wanted it to go, my opponent obviously was was playing some great tennis, and I've had to compete against so many incredible athletes throughout the entire fortnight," she continued.

Despite her runner-up finish, Anisimova has since jumped up the WTA rankings, breaking into the top 10 for the first time at No. 7.

"It feels so surreal to be ranked [No.] 7 right now -- it's my career high and what a quick turnaround for me," she told "GMA."

Anisimova added that there were larger takeaways, like having her family present and "getting to experience that moment with me," which she called "incredibly special."

"Getting to meet Kate Middleton after the final at the ceremony, there were so many special moments and so many other things that I can take away apart from the performance in itself," she added.

The New Jersey native took a hiatus from the professional circuit in May 2023 until January 2024 to focus on her mental health and said that "it's been quite the journey coming back."

"The most important thing for me since coming back has honestly been doing everything on my own terms and just enjoying the moment," she said. "And that's what I told myself coming out into Wimbledon. I was just incredibly excited to just be playing in the main draw, because I didn't make it last year."

Anisimova made history as the youngest American woman singles player to advance to the Wimbledon finals -- after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka -- since Serena Williams.

"Getting to play on on Centre Court and winning against the most incredible athlete in tennis right now was super special to me and just an exhilarating feeling," she said. "It'll last me a lifetime of memories for sure."

The iconic All England Lawn Tennis venue brought with it some very posh quirks, including champagne bottles popping mid-match that prompted officials to silence spectators.

"That was like the 15th time, so I think that my reaction was valid -- it was just a reminder of where I was," Anisimova recalled. "It felt very English -- but it was a funny experience for sure. And then after the match, I was able to laugh about it afterwards, of course."

With the final major of the season just over a month out, Anisimova said she's excited to return to Queens and get on the courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

"The U.S. Open is my favorite tournament by far. It's always super exciting to be playing there, and I'm sure I'll have the whole home crowd cheering for me over there," she said. "Again, all of my family is going to come and support me -- I am sure it's going to be a great tournament. And hopefully I can go far again."

Sabalenka is the current defending women's singles U.S. Open champion.

Anisimova has competed five times in the main draw. Her best U.S. Open finish was reaching the third round in 2020.

The menu was as elite as the guest list at Wimbledon's Champions' Dinner this year, with tennis royalty gathered in black tie at Raffles London at The OWO - a luxury hotel and event space in Whitehall, central London.

The evening marked a glittering finale to a fortnight of tennis in SW19, where Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek were triumphant in the men's and women's singles events respectively.

The gala is hosted by the All England Club to honour the tournament's champions alongside dignitaries and sponsors.

It is tradition for Wimbledon champions to pose with their trophies during the dinner, with the men's and women's singles winners often sharing a dance as a highlight of the evening.

Sinner and Swiatek obliged on Sunday night, stepping on the stage for a brief, 20‑second dance to 'Feel It Still' by Portugal. The Man.

But before the dancing began, guests were treated to a decadent three-course meal.

A post shared by Harriet Dart (@harriet_dart)

To start, diners enjoyed an Orkney scallop, paired with a pumpkin risotto, shavings of 24-month aged Parmesan, and a drizzle of rosemary chicken jus.

The main course featured slow-cooked Hereford beef fillet, accompanied by potato dauphinoise, carrots, braised short rib, and a helping of red wine jus.

For dessert, a summery Eton mess arrived with blackberries, passionfruit, and a touch of Bermondsey bees honey.

The meal was paired with a thoughtful wine selection, including a La Rose Creation, a 2022 French Chablis, and a 2023 Chianti from Italy.

Swiatek won the women's tournament in just 57 minutes, double-bageling American Amanda Anisimova in emphatic fashion on Saturday, to become the first Polish singles champion.

Then on Sunday, Sinner took on double defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the second installment of a growing rivalry at the top of men's tennis, avenging his defeat from the French Open just over a month ago.

Both stars were dressed for the occasion - Swiatek wore a glamourous lilac gown by Stella McCartney worth more than $2,000 (£1494).

And Sinner, who is an ambassador for Italian fashion house Gucci, sported a custom dark suit and tie with a pair of the brand's signature loafers. 

The Italian revealed to BBC Sport how emotional he was after securing a memorable four-set victory over Alcaraz for his fourth major crown, describing it as 'the most amazing thing' that could have happened to him.

'Only me and the people who are close to me know exactly what we have been through on and off the court, and it has been everything except easy,' he said.

'[It is] very emotional, even if I don't cry. To share this moment with my whole family here, it's the most amazing thing that could have happened to me.'

Sinner's victory came just 10 weeks after he returned from a three-month ban following two positive tests for banned substance clostebol.

Meanwhile, Swiatek, whose final was far more routine in its brutality, admitted her triumph was beyond even her own dreams.

'It seems super surreal,' the now six-time Grand Slam champion admitted after her 6-0, 6-0 victory.

'Honestly, I didn't even dream of winning Wimbledon because it was way too far. I feel like I'm an experienced player, having won other Slams, but I didn't expect this.'

Amanda Anisimova had the best Grand Slam finish of her career at The Wimbledon Championships, and though she fell short to Iga Świątek in the final, the American tennis star is taking away some unmatched memories and lessons for her next major of the season.

"It was such a remarkable experience for me, and making it to the first Grand Slam final and it being at Wimbledon was a surreal feeling," the 23-year-old said in a new interview with "Good Morning America."

"Even though it didn't go the way I would have wanted it to go, my opponent obviously was was playing some great tennis, and I've had to compete against so many incredible athletes throughout the entire fortnight," she continued.

Despite her runner-up finish, Anisimova has since jumped up the WTA rankings, breaking into the top 10 for the first time at No. 7.

"It feels so surreal to be ranked [No.] 7 right now -- it's my career high and what a quick turnaround for me," she told "GMA."

Anisimova added that there were larger takeaways, like having her family present and "getting to experience that moment with me," which she called "incredibly special."

"Getting to meet Kate Middleton after the final at the ceremony, there were so many special moments and so many other things that I can take away apart from the performance in itself," she added.

The New Jersey native took a hiatus from the professional circuit in May 2023 until January 2024 to focus on her mental health and said that "it's been quite the journey coming back."

"The most important thing for me since coming back has honestly been doing everything on my own terms and just enjoying the moment," she said. "And that's what I told myself coming out into Wimbledon. I was just incredibly excited to just be playing in the main draw, because I didn't make it last year."

Anisimova made history as the youngest American woman singles player to advance to the Wimbledon finals -- after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka -- since Serena Williams.

"Getting to play on on Centre Court and winning against the most incredible athlete in tennis right now was super special to me and just an exhilarating feeling," she said. "It'll last me a lifetime of memories for sure."

The iconic All England Lawn Tennis venue brought with it some very posh quirks, including champagne bottles popping mid-match that prompted officials to silence spectators.

"That was like the 15th time, so I think that my reaction was valid -- it was just a reminder of where I was," Anisimova recalled. "It felt very English -- but it was a funny experience for sure. And then after the match, I was able to laugh about it afterwards, of course."

With the final major of the season just over a month out, Anisimova said she's excited to return to Queens and get on the courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

"The U.S. Open is my favorite tournament by far. It's always super exciting to be playing there, and I'm sure I'll have the whole home crowd cheering for me over there," she said. "Again, all of my family is going to come and support me -- I am sure it's going to be a great tournament. And hopefully I can go far again."

Sabalenka is the current defending women's singles U.S. Open champion.

Anisimova has competed five times in the main draw. Her best U.S. Open finish was reaching the third round in 2020.

Zverev is coming off a five-set, first-round loss to Arthur Rinderknech at Wimbledon. During his post-match press conference, he opened up about feeling alone while struggling to dig himself out of a hole.

When asked whether the addition of a new coach was of consideration to assist with the situation, Zverev responded, “Possibly. As I said, it's a different feeling right now for me. I can't speak for the moment. But I think I'll have answers by Canada.”Despite the early departure in London, Zverev still stands at No. 4 in the race to the Nitto ATP Finals. The 28-year-old, this year's Australian Open runner-up to Jannik Sinner, was originally slated to compete at the ATP 250 clay event in Kitzbuhel this week.“I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It's not necessarily about tennis. Just lacking joy outside of tennis, as well,” shared the world No. 3 following his Wimbledon exit.

Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka will both be contending at the US Open, which is the next Grand Slam tournament on the horizon.

Swiatek has just won Wimbledon, her sixth Grand Slam title and first since Roland Garros in 2024.

This was another major tournament without a title for world number one Aryna Sabalenka, who was beaten by Amanda Anisimova in the semifinals.

Now, former top 10 player Jack Sock has given his prediction about which of Swiatek and Sabalenka he thinks is more likely to win the US Open.

Despite Swiatek's resurgent Wimbledon title victory, Sock actually believes Sabalenka is more likely to win the US Open this year.

Sabalenka is the defending US Open champion, and Sock has suggested that she will be hungry to end her Grand Slam drought in 2025.

“All credit to Iga but I think I am probably going to ride with Sabalenka as the favourite for the US Open,” Sock said on the Nothing Major podcast. “I think she has proven on all surfaces she can play so big and dominant and blow women off the court in some of these matches with her aggressive play.

“I would side with Sabalenka probably. But Iga not far behind at all. And if not equal favourite for some of these. But I think Sabalenka will come out swinging and have a big purpose come New York and the US Open.”

Swiatek won the US Open in 2022, and Steve Johnson responded by explaining why he thinks she is now fully back in the picture for the biggest titles.

“I think she is definitely going to be talked about in that category again,” said Johnson. “She has not won a title in a year until this point. Iga has firmly planted herself back in the conversation of winning these titles with the other women in the draw.

“Her forehand was immensely better. It felt like she hit it cross court 95% of the time and she was never going to miss and then ultimately just dominated with her backhand.

“Her movement is insane on the grass. It's such a weapon, especially on the women's side. You feel as if she is one of the only few women who are sliding on a grass court and moving like that.”

The first time that Swiatek played Sabalenka at a Grand Slam tournament was in the semifinals of the 2022 US Open.

Despite Sabalenka being up a break in the third set, Swiatek won the match, 3-6 6-1 6-4, to reach the US Open final.

After the match, Sabalenka admitted in her press conference that she made a mistake against Swiatek.

“Well, she was just going for it,” Sabalenka said at the time. “She was hitting every ball and, like, putting me under pressure and playing really aggressively.

“Especially, like, I gave her a lot of opportunities in the first few games. She, like, after she leads 2-Love, then she was just going for it and I was just trying to come back. There was less pressure on her, more pressure on me.

“She was playing aggressively, and I was trying to stay in the game, which was my mistake, I think. I should just go for it.”

That is one of only two times that Swiatek has played Sabalenka at a Grand Slam, with the Belarusian getting revenge at Roland Garros this year.

Zvereva bounced back well from her double bagel by Steffi Graf at Roland-Garros in 1988 and became the best doubles player in the world

If Amanda Anisimova is looking for reasons to be positive after the harshness of her first Grand Slam final, then she could do worse than look at the experience of Natasha Zvereva, until Saturday, the only player in the Open era to suffer a 6-0, 6-0 defeat in a Grand Slam final.

The American was understandably emotional after her double bagel against Iga Swiatek in the final at Wimbledon, but spoke well and promised to bounce back strongly.

Anisimova has plenty of reasons to be optimistic, of course. She played brilliantly on grass, reaching the Queen's final before going all the way to the final at Wimbledon, her first in a major. The American's fighting spirit and ball-striking were equally impressive, especially in her semi-final win over Aryna Sabalenka.

Despite the loss, Amanda Anisimova's journey has been incredible.🎾 Announced mental health break in May 2023🎾 Lost in 2024 Wimbledon qualifying ranked No. 189🎾 Won first WTA 1000 title in February 2025🎾 2025 Wimbledon finalist🎾 Will make WTA Top-10 debut in Monday's… pic.twitter.com/8z4N8cYfno



But the experience of Zvereva in 1988 would also be worth her looking at.

In 1988, Zvereva was just 17 when she reached the final at Roland-Garros, stunning Martina Navratilova on her way. The Belarusian – playing under the Soviet Union flag at the time – also took out Helena Sukova but was hammered by a rampant Graf, who, of course, was in the middle of her golden slam year, when she won all four majors and the Olympics.

It was a humbling experience for Zvereva and could have scarred her for life. But it didn't. In fact, she went on to reach at least the quarter-finals of all four slams, and made the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1998, beating Graf in the fourth round before losing in three sets to the eventual runner-up Nathalie Tauziat.

Zvereva also became a brilliant doubles player, winning 80 titles in all, her partnership with Gig Fernandez one of the best of all time. She won 18 Grand Slam titles in women's doubles and two in mixed.

It's also worth looking at what Zvereva did in the immediate aftermath of her 6-0, 6-0 defeat at Roland-Garros. Always good on grass, she reached the final of her very next tournament, in Eastbourne, and made the last 16 at Wimbledon.

On hard courts in North America, she then beat Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver back to back to reach the final in Canada, losing out to Gabriela Sabatini in the final. She lost in the first round at the US Open but made another final, in Worcester (beating Chris Evert along the way) and qualified for the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships, reaching the quarters of the knock-out event.

So in terms of results, there was very little negative impact on Zvereva's career from that Roland-Garros defeat. Anisimova was right to emphasise the positives in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's loss, the American having never imagined she would make a slam final just a year after returning from a six-month break for mental health reasons.

Radwanska: Don

Agnieszka Radwanska, who was the last Pole to make a final here in 2012, said the key for Anisimova was to remember the good things she did on her way to the final.

“Obviously I really feel for Amanda today,” Radwanska told a small group of reporters. “You could really see she was suffering after the match as well, she felt so bad. 

“But well done for her, she made the final here for the first time, and she beat Sabalenka in the semi-final. So I think it was still a great result for her. Hopefully she'll not be thinking about the result for a long time.”

The best tennis players are great at forgetting bad losses, focusing on the good things and moving ahead. Short-term memory loss is a real strength, but if she needs some inspiration, Anisimova can at least look at Zverev and see what can be done.

The American will be ranked a career-high No 7 now, which will ensure her some more favourable draws, in theory, and on hard courts, she should be a real threat. There are also many areas she can improve on and the way she spoke afterwards bodes well for her chances.

“I told myself, I'll definitely come out stronger after this,” she said. “I mean, that's not an easy thing to go through, losing 0 and 0 in a Grand Slam final. (But) if anything, I can look at it as a positive and something I can look at as motivation going forward. Obviously there's a lot of things I need to do to progress.”

Carlos Alcaraz's dream of winning a third consecutive Wimbledon title came to an end on Sunday evening after losing to Jannik Sinner in the final.

The Spaniard was no match for his long-time rival in their latest encounter, losing 6-4 4-6 4-6 4-6 on Centre Court.

Alcaraz, who also lost to Sinner at Wimbledon in 2022, was ultimately out-performed by Sinner from the baseline and his usual drop-shot tactic did not work as effectively against the agile Italian.

However, Alcaraz is already a five-time Grand Slam champion at 22 years of age, and he has another opportunity to win a major at the US Open in September.

Jimmy Connors, a record-holder of five US Open titles, pinpointed a particular area of Alcaraz's pre-match routine before the Wimbledon final that he would not have done during his playing career.

Jimmy Connors' opinions hold weight when it comes to tennis. An eight-time Grand Slam champion, Connors has a wealth of valuable experience to draw on and share with the wider population.

Connors, who won two Wimbledon titles, was speaking on the ‘Advantage Connors Podcast‘ when the topic of Alcaraz and Sinner's entourages arose.

Speaking to his son and co-host Brett Connors, Jimmy said: “I saw before they walked out on court, I think it was Alcaraz. He was getting ready to walk out on court and he must have hugged seven or eight guys. 

“Your mum told me ‘get out there and play and let's go home.'

“But they were hugging seven or eight guys in their camp. You have this guy and that guy, who is going to do this and that. To the point where I would have looked at that as a distraction.

“They look at that now differently. They look at that now that everybody is there for a reason and they have a purpose.”

Despite losing on Sunday, Carlos Alcaraz can take great confidence heading into the US Open in August, a place where he is a former champion.

Alcaraz had not lost any of his previous Grand Slam finals heading into Wimbledon, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in those finals.

Despite that confidence, Jannik Sinner remains the clear favourite for the title. He has won three hard-court majors to Alcaraz's one, most recently capturing the 2025 Australian Open title.

The US Open will be contested by Alcaraz, Sinner and many others between August 24 and September 7.

With the grass-court season over for another year, the qualification battle for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF is starting to heat up.

The 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik and 18-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca are first and second, respectively, in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and continued to set the pace by reaching the third round at Wimbledon. American Learner Tien won his first match at the grass-court major to further cement third spot. All three players competed in the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in 2024, when Fonseca became the sixth champion at the 20-and-under event.



With the Top 8 players in the Live Race To Jeddah qualifying for the tournament, held in Jeddah from 17-21 December, there are a host of names aiming to compete in Saudi Arabia for the first time.

Croatian Dino Prizmic and Belgian Alexander Blockx have both reached ATP Challenger Tour finals in the past fortnight. Prizmic climbed to fourth in the Live Race To Jeddah following his final run on clay in Milan, while fifth-placed Blockx reached the title match on hard courts in Winnipeg.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz remain the players to beat in men's tennis, having won each of the last seven Grand Slam titles.

Sinner winning Wimbledon is a positive for tennis, although the continued dominance of him and Alcaraz may not be.

They have played out the last two Grand Slam finals, and occupy the top two spots in the ATP Tour rankings, with Sinner at number one.

Rafael Nadal congratulated Alcaraz and Sinner after their Wimbledon battle, which arrived just over a month after their French Open final clash.

Novak Djokovic is the last player outside of the pair to win a Grand Slam, having triumphed at the US Open in 2023.

And their next rival has now been discussed by former professionals John Isner and Jack Sock on the Nothing Major Show.

Offering his most likely player to challenge Sinner and Alcaraz, Isner commented: “I am going to say Taylor Fritz. I think he is the one guy who has the best chance. And I think right behind him I think is Ben Shelton.”

Sock added: “I would say over three out of five at these Slams, I just don't. I would give Fritz an edge over Ben for sure.

“Maybe I would throw an [Alexander] Zverev in with a new potential team around him and potentially some new energy and new motivation out there.

“If he is serving as well as he can and playing well on one of these US Opens, Centre Court or Australia. He would probably be my only guy, probably him and Taylor.”

Also sharing his verdict on the situation was another former player, with Steve Johnson referencing the Big Three in his analysis.

That Big Three of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer once dominated the ATP Tour, and occupy the top three spots for the most men's Grand Slam titles won.

Djokovic, who just lost his Wimbledon semifinal with Sinner, leads the way with 24, followed by the retired Nadal and Federer with 22 and 20 respectively.

Johnson said: “It is kind of like it was in the Roger, Rafa and Novak era. Who is going to beat both of these guys back-to-back in a tournament?

“Who is going to beat one in the semis and the other in the final? You need somebody to help you out. You need Grigor [Dimitrov] to beat Sinner and then Novak can get through that side if he can and then play his best against Carlos.

“You need some help and some love. But I really don't know if there is a guy who can beat both of them back-to-back in the semis and final.

“That's going to be the biggest hurdle to climb, so you are going to need some help. If you only have to beat one of them I do think a Fritz, a [Jack] Draper, a [Lorenzo] Musetti, a Novak.

“Guys can beat one on any given day, but to beat them on a Friday and Sunday, semis and finals, at a Slam, that is a big ask.”

Like Djokovic, Fritz reached the semis at Wimbledon, but Draper and Musetti fell in the second and first rounds respectively.

There will, of course, be plenty of opportunities for such players to bounce back over the coming years, but whether or not they can reach the levels of the current top two remains to be seen.

Former doubles world No 1 Rennae Stubbs has predicted that Novak Djokovic could call time on his legendary tennis career at the Australian Open.

Djokovic was beaten in straight sets by eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the semi-final of Wimbledon last week, with the Serbian appearing to be hampered by an injury issue sustained in his quarter-final.

The former world No 1 claimed the injury began to trouble him during the first set of his 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 loss, though after the match denied rumours it was his final appearance at the All England Club.

“I would be sad, but hopefully it's not my last match on the Centre Court. I'm not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today,” said Djokovic, a seven-time Wimbledon champion.

“So I'm planning to come back definitely at least one more time, play on the Centre Court for sure.”

Despite Djokovic's insistence that he will return to Wimbledon in 2026, questions about his long-term future have lingered in recent days.

Tennis legend John McEnroe questioned how willing the 38-year-old would be to remain a “notch or two” below the likes of Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, and now six-time doubles Slam winner Stubbs has had her say.

Speaking on the Rennae Stubbs Tennis Podcast, the Australian suggested that Djokovic could call time on his career at the Australian Open, where he has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam titles.

“I think he has sort of hinted that the last Grand Slam will be the Australian Open,” said Stubbs.

“And I think the reason for that is because it has been his most successful, winning it [10] times.

“I think it's not a bad way for him to go out if he decides to. It has clearly been the best place for him to win a Grand Slam. If he can get to 25, that is probably where he is going to do it.

“I thought his best chance was at Wimbledon, that has slipped away, but I think he probably almost feels that the Australian has been so mercurial in his life, he has had so many dramatic moments in his life, where he was treated very poorly by the Australian government.

“So it's an interesting dichotomy, but I think that is where he wants to finish his career, and that is where I think probably will be his last Grand Slam.”

Jannik Sinner and Darren Cahill make coaching confession after Wimbledon title triumph

Djokovic's 10 Australian Open singles titles are a record for a male or female player in the Open Era, with the Serbian winning his first major title at the tournament back in 2008.

The Serbian then won three straight titles from 2011-13 and back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016, before further triumphs from 2019-21, and his most recent triumph in 2023.

Djokovic was beaten in the 2024 semi-final by eventual champion Sinner, his first defeat in an Australian Open semi-final, while he retired injured at the same stage versus Alexander Zverev this January.

Alongside Sinner, the 38-year-old is one of just two men to reach the last four of every Grand Slam tournament this season, though he was also beaten by the Italian in straight sets at Roland Garros.

Djokovic currently looks set to return to action at the Canadian Open, with the 38-year-old on the provisional entry list released this week.

He is a four-time champion at the tournament, but has not competed at the event since a third-round defeat back in 2018.

Jannik Sinner recently revealed that fellow Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek was the driving force behind their participation in one of the tournament's most treasured off-court traditions, the Champions' Dance.

While the two Grand Slam winners were initially told the performance wasn't necessary due to the late hour, Świątek insisted they honor the ritual, ultimately convincing Sinner to step onto the dance floor.

Held on the final Sunday evening of The Championships, the Champions' Ball has long been a celebratory staple at Wimbledon. Traditionally, it brings together the newly crowned men's and women's singles winners, along with champions from other categories, for an evening, away from the intensity of Centre Court.

Both Sinner and Świątek earned their maiden Wimbledon singles titles this year, making their joint appearance at the ball even more special.

Sinner arrived in a classic black suit, crisp white shirt, and matching tie. As the top seed, the Italian outclassed a formidable field, taking out Luca Nardi, Aleksandar Vukic, Pedro Martínez, 19th seed Grigor Dimitrov, 10th seed Ben Shelton, and seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic, before avenging his Roland Garros defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

Świątek, meanwhile, stunned spectators with a dominant run that culminated in a flawless 6-0, 6-0 win over Amanda Anisimova in the championship match. Dressed in a pearl blue Stella McCartney satin gown, the Polish star celebrated her sixth career Major and her first on grass, ending a year-long title drought.

After the event, a now-viral video showed Sinner and Świątek laughing and enjoying a dance together at the Champions' Ball.

 

 

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)



The delightful dance moment came to light when the BBC shared a behind-the-scenes video where Sinner opened up about how it all came together.

“Yes, I mean, we were there and in the beginning they told us that we, because it was quite late, that we don't have to do it,” Sinner said in the clip.

“And then Iga told me, ‘No, no, let's do it.' I was like, ‘Okay.' It's tradition, so it's good to make that happen. And yeah, it was nice to share this moment with Iga and it's, yeah, a beautiful moment.”

Jannik Sinner says Iga Swiatek convinced him to do the Wimbledon Champions' dance:

“They told us that we don't have to do it because it was quite late. Then Iga told me ‘No, no.. let's do it.' I was like okay.” 😂

World No 1 Jannik Sinner increased his lead over second-placed Carlos Alcaraz in the ATP Rankings with his Wimbledon title, but the Italian will be under pressure to remain top during the upcoming North American swing.

Sinner has held the No 1 spot for the past 58 weeks as he became the first Italian to climb to the top of the rankings after the 2024 French Open.

The only time he was really in danger of losing his status was when he was banned from February until May, handing Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev an opportunity to overtake him, but they both fluffed their chances with poor displays during the Sunshine Double at the Indian Wells Open and Miami Open.

Alcaraz, though, managed to chip away at Sinner's lead in recent months following an excellent clay-court season and his title run at the Queen's Club Championships, but he was always going to face an uphill task at Wimbledon where he was the defending champion.

Sinner started the grass-court Grand Slam with a 1,130-point lead over his closest rival, and by winning the title, he has increased that advantage to a massive 3,430 points with the other challengers well adrift.

1. Jannik Sinner – 12,030
2. Carlos Alcaraz – 8,600
3. Alexander Zverev – 6,310
4. Taylor Fritz – 5,035
5. Jack Draper – 4,650

But all is not lost for Alcaraz as the tables will be turned during the North American swing as Sinner has a lot of points to defend in the coming months.

The Spaniard had a torrid hard-court campaign 12 months ago as he lost early at the Cincinnati Open and US Open while he didn't compete at the Canadian Open due to the Paris Olympics.

The five-time Grand Slam winner has only 60 points to defend while Sinner will drop 3,200.

The Italian had a summer to remember as he won the titles at Cincinnati (1,000) and Flushing Meadows (2,000) while he also reached the quarter-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Canada (200).

That 3,430-point will thus evaporate pretty quickly, but Sinner will remain at No 1 until at least after the US Open even if Alcaraz wins the Masters events in Ohio and Toronto and it means he is guaranteed another eight weeks at No 1.

Alcaraz has spent a total of 36 weeks at the top of the rankings during four different spells, but he was last No 1 in September 2023 when Novak Djokovic brought an 11-week stint to an end.

The 22-year-old, though, is favourite to finish the season as No 1 as he currently has a 1,500-point lead over Sinner in the ATP Rankings Race To Turin with the standings usually a marker for the year-end top spot.

Sinner finished as the year-end No 1 in 2024 while Djokovic was No 1 in December 2023 with Alcaraz top in 2022.

                Sinner is just the 11th man in the Open Era to reach at least the final of all four Grand Slam tournaments.

It's no secret that Prince George is enthusiastic about an array of sports.

He's accompanied his father, Prince William, to numerous football matches, and is also said to be a huge fan of rugby, scuba diving, and tennis.

On Sunday, the 11-year-old made a rare appearance as he joined his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and his sister, Princess Charlotte, at the Wimbledon men's singles final.

Ahead of the show-stopping tennis match between Jannik Sinner and defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz, Prince George made a rare public comment about his own racket skills.

It's Wimbledon and over on The HELLO! Royal Club, royal shopper Leanne has delved into Princess Kate's Wimbledon wardrobe and offered some predictions on what the fashionable royal might opt for this week.

During a discussion with Wimbledon doubles champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, Cash asked George if he was any good at tennis, to which George replied: "I'm all right."

It's a passion that runs in the family, with Princess Charlotte also showcasing an interest in the sport.

The Princess has joined her family courtside on several occasions, with the youngster also securing a very special keepsake following this year's Championships.

After the gripping match, footage showed sibling duo George and Charlotte chatting with Jannik. Charlotte held up two tennis balls, which the Wimbledon champ then proceeded to sign with his autograph. Take a look in the video below...

As she thanked the Italian athlete for signing their balls, saying: "Thank you so much, that's very kind of you," Charlotte handed him a third tennis ball for their younger brother Louis, who couldn't attend. "They've brought one for their brother as well," the Princess of Wales explained.

The racket sport is also said to be a firm favourite of William and Kate's, though the royal couple have admitted that their competitive spirit can sometimes get in the way.

During a previous appearance on Mike Tindall's The Good, The Bad and The Rugby podcast, Zara's husband jokingly said to Kate: "I'm not going to say you're uber competitive, but…", which prompted Kate to reply: "I'm not competitive at all."

After the conversation veered towards tennis, the mother-of-three went on to reveal: "I don't think we've actually managed to finish a game of tennis", adding that the game "becomes a mental challenge between the two of us."

Kate reportedly took tennis lessons at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham when she and Prince William lived at Kensington Palace. She also played doubles alongside Swiss great Roger Federer ahead of the 2023 Wimbledon tournament, and teamed up with British star, Emma Raducanu, in 2021 at a homecoming celebration, hosted by the Lawn Tennis Association.

At the time, Emma said of Kate's tennis skills: "Her forehand was incredible. I was very impressed. It was a lot of fun to play tennis with the Duchess."

HELLO! Royal Editor Emily Nash was in Windsor earlier this week to witness 'le magnifique' French state visit and has written all about it in her weekly newsletter over on The HELLO! Royal Club.

From the secrets of the spectacular table setting at the state banquet and the surprising misfortune of the participating soldier, to the surprising music played during dinner and who turned up late to meet the Queen and Brigitte Macron the morning after the night before, let Emily take you though the hidden details of a momentous royal occasion.

The Spanish former world number two has worked her way back into the top 10 this year after a string of injuries, including a chronic lower back issue, had left her contemplating retirement.

Badosa lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 to Katie Boulter in the first round of Wimbledon earlier this month, and in a statement on Monday said she had suffered a tear in her psoas, the muscle which connects the lower back to the top of the leg.

"These are really challenging times for me but I'm staying hopeful that things will turn around soon and the light at the end of the tunnel will start to shine through," Badosa said, adding that the injury had occurred before Wimbledon.

Badosa is scheduled to play alongside Stefanos Tsitsipas in the US Open's revamped mixed doubles event, which will take place a week before the August 24 to September 7 singles main draw.

Amanda Anisimova said her fighting spirit was what had carried her through to the 2025 Wimbledon final.

It's that same fighting spirit she'll need to lean on more than ever in order to move beyond her last match of the tournament.

Anisimova confronted Iga Swiatek in her first Grand Slam final and was beaten 6-0 6-0 by the Polish superstar, who improved her own record in Slam finals to a perfect 6-0.

It was the first Wimbledon women's singles final since 1911 to feature a double bagel, and just the second Grand Slam final to be determined by that scoreline in the Open era.

In her post-match press conference, Anisimova was realistic when analysing the defeat, yet determined to use the experience as an opportunity for growth.

“It was a bit tough to digest obviously, especially during and right after. It's not how I would have wanted my first Grand Slam final to go,” she said.

“I think I was a little bit in shock after, as well. But I told myself, ‘I'll definitely come out stronger after this'. I mean, that's not an easy thing to go through, losing 0 and 0 in a Grand Slam final.

“If anything, I can look at it as a positive and something I can look at as motivation going forward. Obviously there's a lot of things I need to do to progress.”

Until that point of the tournament, Anisimova had enjoyed a brilliant run.

She opened her own campaign with a 6-0 6-0 win over dangerous grasscourter Yulia Putintseva, then showed outstanding grit and fighting spirit to hold off Dalma Galfi and 30th seed Linda Noskova in back-to-back three setters to reach the quarterfinals.

There, she survived a late fightback from Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to set up a semifinal with world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, whom she outplayed on Centre Court – in another intense three-set affair – to reach her first major final.

Even before the nerves of a maiden Grand Slam final kicked in, she was already physically drained.



The empty tank could have contributed to her serving performance; she landed less than half of her first serves and won just 26 per cent of first-serve points.

Anisimova was clear all these areas of her game required attention as she moved forward.

“I think, if anything, it's my physicality that I need to work on,” she said.

“To be able to last two weeks in a Grand Slam is definitely something that you need to work a lot on. It's not an easy feat.

“There's a lot of room for improvement. I think it's more experience for me on how to handle nerves. It's my first slam final, so at least I have that experience now.

“I don't really know what was going on with my serve… I'm sure me and my team will get to the bottom of it. It's definitely something that I need to work on because I feel like the last two weeks I've dug myself out of so many holes because I've been struggling so much on my first serve.

“To honestly make it to the finals of Wimbledon with a mediocre serve… I obviously have to look back at film, but I feel like I've been fighting my way through with an average serve.”

With her run to the Wimbledon final, Anisimova rises to a career-high ranking of world No.7 – her top-10 debut.

Her first WTA 1000 title in Doha, a trip to the fourth round at Roland Garros and a finals appearance at Queen's have been other highlights in 2025, during which Anisimova has won 31 of 44 matches.

Just 23 years of age, Anisimova has already been forced to contend with the death of her father, and eight months out of the game in 2023 to address her mental health.

Her incredible strength of character is already obvious, and this resilience will help stand her in good stead as she navigates the next step forward in her career.

“When I got back to the locker room, I kind of had that switch in my mind of: ‘You know what? This is probably going to make you stronger in the end,” Anisimova said, “and to not really put myself down after today and just try and focus on how I can come out stronger after this.

“I think it's honestly, like, a fork in the road. It's whatever direction you want to go in. I'm going to choose the path of working towards my goals and to try and keep improving, hopefully put myself in more positions and opportunities like today.

“I think that's going to help me reach my goals.”

Amid continued speculation over Max Verstappen's future, Jenson Button has given his take on how a switch to Mercedes could play out for the Dutchman – and what the situation could hold for George Russell.

Jenson Button has admitted that he would “love” to see Max Verstappen and George Russell become team mates at Mercedes amid continued speculation about the Dutchman's future, though the 2009 World Champion also suggested that changing teams could be “tricky” for Verstappen.

Talk surrounding a possible move to the Silver Arrows for Verstappen grew in Austria when Russell – whose current deal runs until the end of 2025 – told Sky Sports F1 that it was "only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing".

Facing questions about the situation one week later at the British Grand Prix, Verstappen remained tight-lipped as he stated: "I have nothing to add. What I said last week. Other people write stuff, that's great but it's not for me."

Former Team Principal Christian Horner – speaking before his exit from the team – also dismissed the speculation as “a lot of noise” as he reiterated that Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull through to the end of 2028.

During an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X, Button was asked about how possible a straight swap between Verstappen and Russell might be, to which he answered: “I mean, possible.”

However, the Briton also acknowledged that a change of team could pose some challenges for Verstappen, who has spent all of his F1 career to date within the Red Bull fold.

“It's a tricky one for Max, because he's in a position where he's doing so well with Red Bull – they've given him so much over the years,” said Button. “They've designed this car around him, and he's extremely good at it. Nobody can match him in that car.

“They're so far off him. I mean, him qualifying third or fourth, and them qualifying 18th. If he goes to Mercedes, it's a different thing altogether. You know, that car is not going to be designed around him. So, is it going to work for him? I don't know.

“I mean, the best in the world should be able to make that work for him. It's a tough one on George, because George is at the top of his game. I think he's been so competitive. When you see what he did against Lewis [Hamilton] in the last few years, he is World Championship material.

“So, to replace Max with him, it just seems like a strange move. I know they've got the young Kimi Antonelli, who's 18, who could be a future star. But we still don't know that.

“Whereas George is there, he is good, and you need two very competitive drivers with this new era of the sport. Next year, obviously lots of regulation changes, car change, engine change. So, for me, George and Max would be a better line-up.”

Pushed on whether he could see such a partnership working – with Verstappen and Russell having shared some contentious moments on track in recent times – Button conceded: “I would love to see it!”

Fernando Alonso has given an insight into the impact that Adrian Newey has had on the Aston Martin team, with the Spaniard admitting that the squad are "learning" from their new Managing Technical Partner.

Fernando Alonso has admitted that the Aston Martin team are “all learning” from Adrian Newey, with the two-time World Champion conceding that the design chief has a “much wider view of how the team should operate”.

Newey started in his new position as Managing Technical Partner of the Silverstone-based squad in March, months after it was confirmed that the Briton would join the team following his departure from Red Bull.

During the British Grand Prix weekend, Alonso was quizzed on how much he has been speaking with Newey, leading the Spaniard to give an insight into how the famed designer is already having an impact on Aston Martin.

“We had a couple of lunches together,” Alonso said of Newey. “Generally [focused on] things about the team, about the simulator, how to make things a little bit more realistic, and he has a lot of experience [of] how a top team should fight for championships and try to be on top of the game in every area.

“It's not only the aerodynamics. When we think about Adrian, it is all aero performance; I think Adrian has a much wider view of how the team should operate, so we all learn from him every time that we speak with him.”

It is no secret that Newey has been focusing his attentions on preparing for 2026, a year in which a new wave of technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.

Alonso himself is set to remain onboard through next year – but, when asked if he is already thinking about what his future might look like beyond 2026, the 43-year-old responded: “No, not really. Not in my mind now.

“The decision will be made next year, I think, around summer time or before to have things clear as soon as possible. Right now, the championship is challenging this year. We didn't start as competitive as we thought, and now we want to turn the situation [around].

“We want to finish the second part of 2025 as strong as possible. Then 2026, everything remains to be seen. Step by step, and [it's] impossible to think right now into 2027.”

Aston Martin currently sit in eighth place of the Teams' Championship, tied on 36 points with seventh-placed Racing Bulls.

With Valtteri Bottas having been linked to Alpine, Pierre Gasly has given his take on the speculation.

Pierre Gasly has labelled the rumours linking Valtteri Bottas to Alpine as “a lot of noise”, with the Frenchman suggesting that the team need to “just focus on the work ahead” as they try to take steps forward.

The Enstone-based outfit have already made changes to their line-up this season, having opted to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto from Round 7 in Imola onwards.

It was then recently revealed that Alpine have enquired about the availability of Mercedes reserve driver Bottas, should they decide to make any further alterations either this year or beyond.

With the squad having faced a difficult campaign so far – which has left them at the bottom of the Teams' Championship on 19 points, 10 adrift of Haas in ninth place – Gasly was asked during the British Grand Prix weekend about the Bottas speculation and whether it could be useful for Alpine to have another experienced driver onboard to act as a benchmark.

“I don't think that's the case,” the 29-year-old responded. “I think it's a lot of noise. I think the car, I'm showing every weekend what we can do with it, doing a very good job on Saturdays and putting it in places that on paper we all agree we should not really be.

“It's just tricky, it's a very tight midfield and we are at the back of it. There will always be noise, especially considering what happened earlier in the year, but I think at the end of the day we should just focus on the work ahead.

“It's going to be a long season. We don't have upgrades, the car is not in the best place, but all of us need to focus on what we've got to do and try and do it the best way that we can.”

Pushed on whether the car is actually the main issue, rather than the drivers, Gasly acknowledged that the incredibly fine margins across the midfield are also a key factor in the challenge Alpine face.

“It's easy to make it sound more dramatic than it is,” he explained. “I think it's just a very tough field. You look a couple of years back, being eight [or] nine-tenths off the fastest car would put you sixth, seventh on the grid.

“This year being eight [or] nine-tenths slower than the fastest car puts you on the back row. I think everyone has done a very good job, we know the strengths and weaknesses of our package. We don't have the strongest car, we don't have the strongest engine – both combined doesn't put us in a very good spot.

“But I see a lot of good stuff happening in the team in terms of trying to get the maximum we can. We know the focus is on 2026 and it comes with some compromises on this year, which are tough to take, but hopefully we see the dividends next year.”

Nico Hulkenberg's 15-year wait for a podium

After Nico Hulkenberg's climb from P19 to the podium in the British Grand Prix, F1.com looks back at some of the most impressive rises to the rostrum in the sport's history.

In a result that perhaps few would have predicted beforehand, Nico Hulkenberg rose from the back of the grid to third place in the British Grand Prix to seal his long-awaited first podium. The Kick Sauber man's performance has earned its place on the list of impressive rises to the rostrum – so, to mark that, we've been taking a look back at 10 other remarkable drives to the podium…

Hulkenberg had lined up in P19 on race day at Silverstone – and Rubens Barrichello found himself in a similar position ahead of the German Grand Prix in 2000, the Brazilian ending up in P18 on the grid at Hockenheim after his car suffered electrical issues in Qualifying.

While Ferrari team mate – and championship leader – Michael Schumacher found himself out of the running on Lap 1 following a collision with Benetton's Giancarlo Fisichella, Barrichello started to carve his way through the field in a race featuring changing weather conditions.

The driver from Sao Paulo handled the subsequent chaos of others crashing, Safety Car phases and further heavy rain to clinch his debut victory in F1, leading to emotional scenes on the podium as Barrichello tearfully processed his achievement.

Barrichello went on to achieve a total of 11 victories in Formula 1 – and while none of these took place at his home race, one driver to claim a particularly memorable win in Sao Paulo is Max Verstappen, who pulled off a remarkable comeback drive at the 2024 event.

Race day in Brazil had already proven frenetic hours before the Grand Prix, with Qualifying taking place earlier on Sunday after being postponed owing to Saturday's treacherous weather conditions.

Amid five red flags in the session after several crashes, another big shock occurred when Verstappen exited Q2 in 12th place, which then became 17th on the grid due to a five-place penalty for using a new power unit.

This did not deter the Red Bull driver, who made numerous overtakes to climb up the order during a chaotic rain-affected race – and, after taking the lead from Alpine's Esteban Ocon just past the halfway point, the Dutchman was untouchable as he stormed to a stunning victory.

Brazil has certainly seen its fair share of eventful races over the years, with Verstappen's first Interlagos win some five years earlier also featuring an impressive rise through the field from his former team mate, Carlos Sainz.

After a challenging few seasons, McLaren looked to be on an upward trajectory in 2019, the team scoring a solid haul of points via their new line-up of Sainz and Lando Norris.

A decent result looked like it would be harder to come by at the penultimate round in Sao Paulo, however, with Sainz forced to start from the back of the grid following a loss of power during Saturday's Qualifying.

Despite this, the Spaniard made a one-stop strategy work in his favour on Sunday as he powered through from P20 to cross the line in P4 – and with third-placed Lewis Hamilton later receiving a five-second penalty for a collision with Alex Albon, Sainz was promoted to third, handing him his maiden top-three result as well as marking McLaren's first podium finish since 2014.

Needless to say, there were countless moments of Ayrton Senna brilliance across his career in Formula 1 – and one of these occurred early on for the Brazilian as F1 hit the streets of Monaco during his debut campaign in 1984.

In his fifth Grand Prix start – and first at a street circuit – Senna had put his Toleman in P13 on the grid and went on to display his skill at driving in the wet during a race that saw others struggle in the damp conditions.

His progression through the field saw him work his way up to P2 behind future title rival Alain Prost, the Frenchman leading at the wheel of his McLaren.

Senna went on to pass Prost, but the decision was then taken to stop the race owing to the conditions, with the countback placing Senna in second place at the final order. While he had to wait a little longer for his debut victory, the future World Champion had well and truly made his mark with his storming drive.

When F1 raced in Sakhir for the penultimate round of the 2020 campaign, Sergio Perez was facing an uncertain future amid the news that the Mexican would be replaced at Racing Point – soon to be known as Aston Martin – by Sebastian Vettel in 2021.

As he searched for a new team, Perez had put in some good performances through 2020 including a second place in Turkey, but his prospects in Sakhir did not initially appear so promising after a collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1 dropped him to the back of the pack.

However, Perez was a man on the move throughout the ensuing race, climbing the order before later benefitting from the misfortunes of Mercedes up ahead to surge into the lead and grab his first-ever F1 victory.

The Mexican admitted to being left “speechless” by the result, which came on his 190th Grand Prix start – and it seemed to be enough to prove to Red Bull that Perez was deserving of a drive, the team announcing within a matter of weeks that they had signed him for 2021.

Lewis Hamilton has put in more than one impressive recovery drive during his glittering F1 career to date – and one of the most memorable came at the Belgian Grand Prix in 2016, a year famed for the Briton's fierce title fight with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton arrived into the weekend as the championship leader, 19 points clear of Rosberg, but a number of grid penalties for changing engine components meant that the British driver would start the race at Spa-Francorchamps from the back.

Drama for some of the frontrunners on the opening lap allowed Hamilton to move up to P15, and from there onwards he stayed out of trouble and handled subsequent Safety Car phases and a red flag to cross the line in third place.

Alongside the fact that this damage limitation allowed Hamilton to maintain his championship lead, the World Champion also notched up the unique statistic of becoming the first driver to have taken a podium from 20th on the grid or lower on three occasions.

When it comes to dramatic events in the sport's history, the Canadian Grand Prix in 2011 has well and truly earned its place in F1 lore.

As well as becoming the longest Formula 1 race ever – at four hours, four minutes and 39 seconds, to be exact – it was made all the more memorable by Jenson Button bouncing back from numerous incidents to seal an against-the-odds victory.

After an early clash with McLaren team mate Lewis Hamilton dropped him backwards, Button's afternoon went on to feature everything from a puncture to a drive-through penalty – just one of his six visits to the pits – and a last lap overtake for the lead on Sebastian Vettel to secure an incredible victory.

“It felt like I spent more time in the pits than on the pit straights,” Button joked afterwards as he reflected back on his extraordinary comeback drive.

Having already achieved two wins during the 1967 season, Jim Clark looked on course to add to this tally when he secured pole position for the ninth round of the campaign at Monza.

The Briton held the lead as the race got underway, but a puncture on Lap 12 saw him drop one lap behind the rest of the field – resulting in the two-time World Champion embarking on a remarkable fightback.

After picking off numerous cars, Clark had hauled himself back into P1 with eight laps remaining. But the Scot's victory chances were again dashed when his Lotus experienced a fuel issue on the final tour, meaning that he was passed by John Surtees and Jack Brabham.

Despite this, Clark still held onto third place in a drive that has been revered by many as one of his greatest.

The 2012 season was a highly competitive one, with a different driver each taking victory across the opening seven rounds of the year.

Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel had embarked on a strong run in the second half of the campaign, the Red Bull driver having won four consecutive races when F1 arrived in Abu Dhabi for the third to last round of the season.

But when officials had been unable to take a fuel sample from his car post-Qualifying, Vettel – who was by this point engaged in a close title fight with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso – was excluded from the results and started the race from the pit lane.

An eventful afternoon followed for the German driver, who recovered from front wing damage early on to pull off a series of overtakes on his rivals. This culminated in a daring move on Jenson Button's McLaren, securing Vettel a stunning podium result in P3 en route to winning his third World Championship at the end of the year.

This list would simply not be complete without a mention of John Watson's history-making win at the Long Beach Street Circuit in 1983.

Qualifying had not gone well for Watson and his McLaren team mate Niki Lauda, the pair finding themselves down in P22 and P23 respectively after tyre struggles during the session.

However, the picture looked very different on race day, with Watson and Lauda both carving their way through the pack to eventually find themselves running in a 1-2 formation.

As Lauda was affected by leg cramps during the latter stages, the Austrian was unable to challenge his team mate and Watson crossed the line to take the win some 27 seconds clear. Having started down in 22nd place, the Northern Irishman continues to hold the record for the lowest grid slot that a win has been taken from.

All moviegoers were evacuated during the incident but most auditoriums — including one of the largest Imax screens in the world — suffered no damage and are back in business.

	Where's Superman when you need him?


	A torrential downpour in New York City and surrounding areas on Monday night forced AMC Lincoln Square 13 — one of the busiest theaters in the country — to evacuate moviegoers and shut down.




	The heavy downpour caused damage to a roof pipe, which led to a significant amount of water coming into a portion of the lower levels of the building, according to a statement from AMC Theatres.


	The Lincoln Square cinema was able to reopen late Tuesday morning, although auditoriums on the bottom floor and other affected areas of the theater will remain closed until the cleanup work is finished.

	There was no damage to the much-in-demand Imax auditorium, which houses one of the largest Imax screens in the world (it's estimated to be 10 stories high). Ditto for the Dolby Cinema auditorium, among many others. Imax and Dolby are both currently playing James Gunn and DC Studio's Superman, with seat maps showing numerous showtimes on Tuesday almost at capacity.


	Videos of Monday evening's flood quickly found their way to social media. One widely circulated video posted to TikTok showed water gushing into a concession area on the lower floor of the multistory cinema. Citizen NYC also monitored the unfolding situation.

	AMC said refunds will be issued automatically for tickets purchased to any affected showtimes on Monday and Tuesday. The circuit, which is the largest theater chain in the country and world, said none of its other theaters in New York or elsewhere nearby were impacted by storm and reiterated that Lincoln Square was a one-off event because of the broken pipe.

	











	Officials said the storm left at least two people dead. In Central Park, more than 2 inches of rain fell in less than an hour, a near-record amount. Some subway lines were also flooded, with road closures and transit delays extending into Tuesday. And a state of emergency was in effect in New Jersey.

First-time Emmy nominee Erin Doherty cooked up a pretty good distraction — literally — when it came to nominations morning. The “Adolescence” star, nominated for Best Limited/Movie Supporting Actress for her work in the smash Netflix hit, was actually making a cake when the nominations rolled in on Tuesday. 

“I was made very aware of [the nominations] and have been made very aware of it, from my girlfriend in particular, she was like, ‘Are you going to watch?' And I was like, ‘No, I'm not!,'” Doherty told IndieWire with a laugh. “I am an anxious person, so I was like, I'll stay away.' I was actually making a cake! And waiting for my agent to call because she said she would.”

When Doherty's agent called? Incredible news: not just her nomination, but 13 overall for the limited series, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series, plus acting noms for co-creator Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper, Ashley Walters, and Christine Tremarco. “I'm so happy for the show, I'm so proud to be a part of it,” a giddy Doherty said over Zoom.

Each episode of the series is designed to look and feel like a single-take, one-hour slice of time. Breakout star Cooper is the driving force of two of those episodes, including the gobsmacking third episode, in which his character Jamie (being held in a youth detention facility before his trial for murdering a classmate) sits down with forensic psychologist Briony Ariston (Doherty) for an unnerving interview. 

While the pair rehearsed for two weeks before shooting, much has been made of the improvisational magic Cooper and Doherty made. They shot two takes a day, five days straight. By the end of it, Cooper told IndieWire previously, he was tired. So he yawned, and Doherty ran with it, asking “Am I boring you?” It was the last take, and the one that made it to air. What does Doherty remember of that? 

“It was so intense and claustrophobic being in that room together, and the whole thing just required us to be present and to bounce off each other,” she said. “So that by the time it ended — and, if you've seen it, [you know] the episode ends in such a climactic release of emotions for me — I left that room and was hugging [series director] Phil [Barantini] and Owen and all our crew, I was just kind of happy to be out of there. I think your body can't distinguish from what is true and what is false. Genuinely, we created such an authentic, horrible environment that I just remember being so grateful to have come to an end.”

 










It was only after filming had ended, Doherty said, did she have the time and space to reflect back on what they had made. “I knew that it was important and vital, but it was only afterwards that I was like, I think we might have made something really special there,” she said.

Watching the show as a fan also offered Doherty continued perspective. “I was kind of in my own little bubble within the realm of the show that I was like, ‘I want to be an audience member of this. … There is no way I'm depriving myself of this opportunity,” she said. “The whole thing was obviously harrowing and disturbing, but I'm so grateful that I got to sit and receive it in that way, because now I get to have those conversations in the world [with other audience members].”

Those conversations run the gamut, she said, from longer chats to quick interactions, the latter of which might be her favorite. 

“What I'm so kind of taken aback by is that a lot of the conversations are just random people on the street, on the tube, being like, ‘Thank you for that show,'” she said. “That is such a gorgeous communication to have with someone, like that's all I'd ever wished to say to people when specific stories have been told that have really hit me. … I think people are just grateful that the conversation is now on the table because it's such a tricky subject matter and one that I think we were all quite afraid of.”

 










She added, “What this show is so great at is, it doesn't actually go, ‘And here are the answers,' because we don't have those answers. We didn't need the answers, we just needed someone to broach the conversation. And I think that's where thank you's come from.”

The series follows in the footsteps in another major Netflix hit from last year: fellow limited series “Baby Reindeer” pulled in 11 nominations in 2024, walking away with six, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. What is it about Netflix that makes it such a perfect home for these heartbreaking, harrowing, ripped-from-real-life stories? 

“It's gotta be the bravery to just, trust in audiences, in their intelligence, in their want to and desire to to be given these really raw human stories,” the actress said. “I think we're ready for it. We always have been, but there's always going to be that dynamic with TV and film of like, ‘It it going to put bums in seats? Is it gonna sell? It's all about, will people watch this thing and, I think this show proves that we want these really authentic stories. We have a hunger for it.”

That's, Doherty thinks, why shows like “Adolescence” and “Baby Reindeer” truly succeed. 

“That's why it absolutely hit the stratosphere in a way that no one was anticipating, because there's such courage behind there,” Doherty said, “I'm so grateful for Netflix for having the ability to just [let] … Jack and Stephen write this story in as true a way as you can, and that's it. There's such integrity within storytelling, it clearly has an impact. … Sometimes you just have to have faith, like, in the truth and the purity of something. That, for me, is what good art does.”

 










Wait, what kind of cake? Doherty laughed. “It's actually a fridge cake, because it's really hot at the minute,” she said. “I've never made it before, and it's actually my birthday tomorrow. So I'm making my own birthday cake, which I'm chuffed about, because I really wanted to make it!”

Talk about a great birthday.

All episodes of “Adolescence” are now streaming on Netflix. The 77th Annual Emmy Awards will air September 14 on CBS.

The July 5 "Back to the Beginning" show raised more than $200 million for three charities, surpassing the amount raised by FireAid and Farm Aid combined.

Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath‘s “Back to the Beginning” raised more money than any charity concert since George Harrison and Ravi Shankar‘s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh popularized the very idea of an all-star benefit show, according to a review of Billboard‘s coverage over the years.


	The heavy metal show, billed as Osbourne's final stage performance, raised roughly $190 million in charitable donations on July 5, according to an Instagram post from the event's musical director, Tom Morello. Notably, that was a big jump from the $140 million Morello said the event raised in an earlier Instagram story, but the event's promoters did not respond to requests for clarification.


	According to statements from the group and its charity partners, the concert, watched by 40,000 ticketholders and 5.8 million individuals online, will distribute funds equally to Birmingham Children's Hospital, Acorn Children's Hospice and Cure Parkinson's — an organization dedicated to finding a cure for the disease Osbourne has lived with since 2019. It is unclear yet what the final donation to each charity will be. 


	Each of those charities said they were able to raise tens of thousands of pounds in additional donations by raffling off tickets to the show, auctioning off iconic art and band photographs donated by Black Sabbath, and through individual contributions from fans as they streamed into the concert, which took place at Villa Park in Birmingham, England.


	While impossible to fact-check so soon after the event, that figure surpasses the amount raised by many of the highest-profile charity concerts of all time, according to a review of Billboard's coverage over the years. Notably, reports from Billboard and other media outlets have relied on figures provided by people affiliated with these concerts, as promoters are not required to publish the total funds raised or how much is deducted to cover expenses. We will strive to update this list with more and better information as we get it. Email ediltsmarshall@billboard.com with any tips.


Here's a list of some of the highest-grossing charity concerts of all time, according to each event's organizers.


FireAid, the five-hour-long mega-concert that featured performances by Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga and Green Day in January 2025, raised more than $100 million for victims of the Los Angeles wildfires that killed 29 people and destroyed more than 16,000 homes earlier that same month. The group began distributing the first $50 million worth of grants to community-based organizations in February.


Live Aid festival, held on July 13, 1985, at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia and broadcast live to an estimated 1 billion viewers in 110 countries, raised roughly $100 million for famine relief in the countries of Ethiopia and Sudan. Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof raised another $10 million for those ravaged by famine before the festival through the release of “Do They Know It's Christmas?”, the best-selling British single that featured U2 and Phil Collins. An additional $60 million was raised for the cause through the release of “We Are The World,” written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie.


Willie Nelson's Farm Aid, the music industry's longest-running charity concert that launched in 1985 to support family farmers hurt by the downturn in the market value of American crops, has raised more than $80 million to support family farmers over the past 40 years. In the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of American farms filed for bankruptcy, with the bankruptcy rate among farmers in 1987 topping the rate just before the Great Depression, U.S.D.A. filings show. According to Billboard, among the first funds dispersed from the charity was a $100,000 check Nelson wrote to a church group that used the money to feed farm families.


	Organized by George Clooney and Haiti-born rapper Wyclef Jean, “Hope for Haiti Now” was a telethon that raised more than $57 million for the island country after the devastating magnitude-7 quake that killed some 200,000 people and left 3 million hurt or homeless in January 2010. Artists like Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z and Chris Martin performed songs as celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman took donations by phone. Proceeds from the fundraiser were distributed through the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, the U.N. World Food Program, Oxfam America, the Red Cross, UNICEF and Yele Haiti Foundation.


	The Concert for Bangladesh was actually a pair of sold-out Madison Square Garden shows organized by former Beatles guitarist Harrison and Indian sitar player Shankar, intended to raise funds for refugees of the conflict in East Pakistan during its fight for independence. Held on Aug. 1, 1971, the concert raised close to $250,000 from the 40,000 tickets sold to the event. However, by 1985, the event had sent, via UNICEF, an estimated $12 million to Bangladesh through revenue raised from a live album and film, Concert for Bangladesh.


	One Love Manchester, Ariana Grande‘s all-star benefit concert held for the victims of the May 22, 2017, terror attack after the singer's show at Manchester Arena, raised $12 million when it was held the month following the event. That amount included $3 million (£2.35 million) raised for the British Red Cross and $9 million (£7.3 million) raised for the Manchester Emergency Fund.

Just when you thought awards season was over, it's time for the Emmys. Nominations for TV's highest honor were announced Tuesday morning, sparking a race that's been heating up for months. Only one of last year's nominees for Best Drama Series remains eligible in 2025, which makes securing a nod (and snagging the trophy) that much more valuable. (Breaking through at the Emmys is critical for shows eyeing to return, season after season.) The Best Comedy Series race is a toss-up, with last year's surprise victor “Hacks” going toe-to-toe with the one-time favorite, “The Bear,” and strong newcomers like “The Studio.” As for Best Limited Series, “Adolescence” seems primed to rack up trophies, but the race can change at any time and being recognized really is an honor unto itself.

With 600 programs submitted in the Best Series categories — only 14 fewer than last year — there is still far too much TV for any voter to watch in the time allotted, which means… there will be snubs. Yes, it's time to talk about the snubs and surprises of 2025, but before we get into it, please remember:

Here at IndieWire, a “snub” is just industry shorthand for a series or individual who was expected to be nominated, thought to be deserving of a nomination, or both, and yet — for whatever reason — they did not receive recognition for their work. (Not today, anyway — there's always the fall awards!) Labeling any such program or person a “snub” does not convey intent; it does't mean their peers had it out for them, or voters purposefully shunned one potential nominee in favor of another.

On the other end of the spectrum, anything dubbed a “surprise” is a series or individual who was thought to be out of the running before nominations were announced; something or someone who was written off too early, whether it was because they didn't mount much of a campaign, didn't match up well in their category, or simply didn't get the typical plaudits heaped upon your standard Emmy nominee.

By and large, it's best if you remember, dear readers, that the very nature of competition means not everyone can win (or, in this case, be nominated), and it's only human for those invested in television to react with shock and awe, admiration and anger, to the TV Academy's picks for the season's best shows.

So, without further ado, let's dig in:

(OK, there's just one more little bit of to-do: Voting for the 2025 Emmy winners will begin August 18 and end August 27 at 10 p.m. PT. The 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set for Sunday, September 14 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.)

With additional reporting by Proma Khosla.

Many prognosticators feared the lead of “Andor” would get boxed out of the heated race for Best Actor in a Drama Series, and indeed he did. Sterling K. Brown (“Paradise”) proved his enduring appeal to the TV Academy, as did Pedro Pascal (despite appearing in less than half of “The Last of Us” Season 2). Gary Oldman (“Slow Horses”), Noah Wyle (“The Pitt”), and Adam Scott (“Severance”) rounded out the category, leaving Luna on the outside looking in.

Actors in blockbuster entertainment (like a “Star Wars” show) have long struggled to gain traction with awards voters, although Brown and Scott's inclusion tarnishes any theories about bias against science-fiction. Odds are the competition was simply too stiff in Luna's category and one favorite had to lose out. (That doesn't explain why Forest Whitaker is the lone “Andor” acting nominee — well-deserved! — so perhaps there's “Star Wars” fatigue within the Academy?)

Zero nominations? None? The first season of “Squid Game” won six Emmys out of 14 nominations, but Season 2 — the only season eligible for the 2025 Emmys — was summarily blanked. Either voters soured on the narrative's repetitive nature, were frustrated by its cliffhanger ending, or simply preferred this year's other dramas! Technically, “Squid Game” Season 3 can compete in next year's Emmys… but it's hard to imagine a return to form after this complete shutout. 

We were preparing to mourn yet another year of snubs for Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen's excellent HBO comedy, but then the TV gods blessed us with two whole nominations! OK, sure, “Somebody Somewhere” — the best series of 2024 — deserves more than single digit nods, but considering one is for Best Writing (honoring both creators and star Bridget Everett) and the other is for breakout supporting star Jeff Hiller, it's hard to complain. You just know Sam and Joel would be giddy right now, already on their way downtown to celebrate over donuts and karaoke. 

Alfonso Cuaron's cunning Apple TV+ series was widely expected to perform well in a down year for limited series, but it could only muster two total nominations: Cate Blanchett (of course) for Best Actress in a Limited Series, and Emmanuel Lubezki and Bruno Delbonnel for Best Cinematography in a Limited Series. 

Although these were clearly the show's most widely hailed elements, Kevin Kline was a surprise exclusion in Best Actor, and “Disclaimer” also got nudged out of Best Limited Series in favor of the latest season of “Black Mirror” (which now qualifies as an anthology). Be it recency bias or Netflix's wider reach, these losses have to sting for the pricey, ambitious adaptation. 

After “The Good Place's” slow start became a respectable run with the TV Academy — landing 12 nominations, including two for Best Comedy Series — as well as “Parks and Recreation's” late surge to 14 total nominations, it felt like Mike Schur's Netflix comedy “A Man on the Inside” was primed for a warm reception from the jump this time.

Instead, just like both of his previous hits, it was shut out. Ted Danson's exclusion stings a bit extra, but the entire series warrants awards attention. Maybe Season 2 can kickstart another Emmy comeback story.

Whatever thoughts you may have about Charlie Brooker's dystopic anthology — that it will never measure up to the early seasons, that it's too close to reality, that it should end — Season 7 was by most counts better than other recent installments, and “Common People” starring Rashida Jones and Chris O'Dowd felt more like early days “Black Mirror” than anything has for a while.

Jones plays a woman with a terminal brain tumor who adopts a new technology called Rivermind, which replaces her tumor with synthetic tissue powered by the company's servers — and financed by a monthly subscription fee that balloons over time as Rivermind swaps empathy for profit. As Amanda's health deteriorates in tandem with her family's financial status, Jones gives an aching performance with darkly comic flourishes, like when she becomes a human ad machine because of Rivermind's updated terms and conditions.

The rest of the season includes the psychological thriller “Bête Noire,” the Issa Rae-led “Hotel Reverie,” game simulation “Plaything,” emotional drama “Eulogy,” and the sequel “U.S.S. Callister: Into Infinity,” a solid successor to one of the series' most popular episodes ever. We might be living in “Black Mirror,” but we can still enjoy it sometimes. —PK

Look, John Mulaney's chaotic collection of comics, experts, actors, and bits might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it spoke to its own eclectic audience and experimented boldly with a weekly release schedule. Instead of Hollywood and headline news, “Everybody's Live” tackles the topics people are already discussing in real life, turning watercooler conversations and group chat debates into televised entertainment — not to mention the interstitial sketches, teen fight night, and pretty much every time Richard Kind pops up on screen. What's most baffling of all is this omission comes in a year where there are only three other nominees in the category. Maybe everybody isn't live, after all. —PK

Despite strong reviews and two nominations at the Gotham TV Awards, Mara Brock Akil's adaptation of Judy Blume's novel never seemed to get any traction. Did voters think it was a YA series, better fit for the Children's and Family Emmys? Did Netflix prioritize its other, higher-profile drama contenders, like “Squid Game,” “The Diplomat,” and “Bridgerton”? Did it need more star power to compete in a particularly starry Emmy field? We may never know, but anyone who saw “Forever” knows it deserved better than this.

Can the Emmys hand out an award for Outstanding Comedy Series in September if the year's best comedy isn't even nominated? I guess we'll find out, since Nathan Fielder's second season of “The Rehearsal” flew away without a nod for the top category.

That being said, “The Rehearsal” Season 2 did improve on Season 1 — landing four total nominations including two for Best Editing and two for Fielder (in Best Writing and Best Directing).

The TV Academy has long been baffled by Fielder, who previously was only nominated for directing Sacha Baron Cohen's 2018 Variety series “Who Is America” and producing John Wilson's “How To with John Wilson.” “The Rehearsal” landed zero nods for its first season, and “The Curse” was notoriously blanked just last year (despite Emma Stone's star power).

“The Rehearsal” Season 2 was considered a dark horse, but its three TCA nominations in July (including for Program of the Year), rave reviews, and wider reach (thanks mainly to Fielder's go-for-broke finale) may have helped it break through, even if they weren't enough to land the top target.

The first season of “Wolf Hall” earned eight Emmy nominations, including nods for Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis, as well as Best Limited Series. The second season of “Wolf Hall”… did not earn eight Emmy nominations. In fact, it earned one — for Best Period Costumes.

What happened? The short answer: Time. The longer answer: There were 10 years between Peter Straughan's debut season and his follow-up, and in that time, the awards race changed dramatically (along with the rest of television). PBS isn't at the top of voters' streaming queues, and historical dramas aren't in vogue (unless they're made by Shonda Rhimes or Julian Fellowes). Toss in the thousands of new voters who've joined the TV Academy in the last decade, and it spelled doom for a once-heralded series (even though “The Mirror and the Light” is absolutely fantastic).

OK, it's honestly a surprise that “Presumed Innocent” earned four nominations at all, given it wasn't nominated for Best Limited Series. That all four came for its cast, however, is less surprising and shows how limited the show's appeal was across the TV Academy's many branches. 

Still, most awards experts though Jake Gyllenhaal would lose out because the series debuted so long ago (last summer) and he couldn't do much campaigning while performing on Broadway in “Othello.” But his star power pushed him through, as it did for Peter Sarsgaard and Ruth Negga, two acclaimed turns from well-known actors (especially in awards circles).

So the biggest surprise has to be Bill Camp — and what a welcome surprise it is. Until today, the beloved character actor only had a single Emmy nomination to his name (in 2017 for “The Night Of”), but his collective body of work since then has earned more and more fans, as well as more and more attention from awards voters. (He was also on the ballot for “Sirens,” which would've been my pick for a nod, but we can always pretend this is for both.) 

Yes, “Andor” did well overall with 14 nominations (including Best Drama Series). But what about its ultimate (evil) power couple? Kyle Soller and Denise Gough were two of the hit “Star Wars” show's biggest breakouts. Their chemistry is palpable and unique. Their storylines are thorny and thrilling. Their exacting depictions of such appalling characters — especially whenever their well-buried humanity would sneak up to the surface — are simply outstanding, and seeing the Supporting Drama fields dominated by the same shows only makes excluding two clear standouts like these that much more frustrating.

After speaking to him a few months ago ahead of the Season 1 finale, I know that possibly no one loves “Paradise” more than executive producer and now lead actor nominee Sterling K. Brown. His nomination is less surprising than the show's overall, given the Television Academy's documented appreciation of Brown throughout “This Is Us” and even back when he broke out in “American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson.”

But “Paradise” nabbing a nom for Outstanding Drama Series might hint at a bigger shift in TV viewing along with HBO's “The Pitt”: that viewers crave the stakes and style of a weekly drama straight out of the network era, and that the episodic release model still has a spark. (Both of those shows, by the way? They're already working on Season 2 with plans to release within a year.) “Paradise” foregrounds social inequality and intrigue at the end of the world, anchored by strong performances from Brown and James Marsden (also nominated) in particular. While we did call this nomination, it's a pleasant surprise and worthy reward for a show that gripped its viewers, this one included. —PK

This year, the 12-time Oscar nominee saw his best chance at landing his first Emmy nomination by taking on the lead role in “The Righteous Gemstone's” Season 4 premiere — a departure episode that flashes back to the Civil War, when the Gemstone family's ancestor, Elijah, stirs up holy hell while posing as a preacher. One could argue Cooper's odds were better last year, when he popped up in “Abbott Elementary” as himself, but the limited screen time didn't offer the same impact as this, even if “Abbott” is far more beloved by the TV Academy than “Gemstones.” Maybe he should've found a way to “The White Lotus”?

To be clear, Uzo Aduba landing an Emmy nomination is almost never a surprise. The talented “Orange Is the New Black” breakout has won three Emmys — two for “OITNB” and one for “Mrs. America” — out of six total nominations (including this one). But despite her aforementioned series' success throughout the TV Academy, she's proven she doesn't need her show to be popular with Emmy voters to earn a slot all by herself. 

For her final nomination on “Orange Is the New Black,” she was one of two total nominations. For “In Treatment,” she was the show's only nomination that season, and now she's the only actor nominated from the bustling cast of “The Residence.” Sure, the Netflix mystery snagged four total nominations, but it did so after being canceled! Canceled! Not even getting abandoned by the world's leading streamer can keep Aduba from attending another Emmys. 

Widely seen as the sixth most-likely nominee in a category with only five slots, “Say Nothing” wasn't expected to make a ton of noise on Emmy morning, but FX's thrilling, complex, and well-acted drama certainly warranted some sort of ruckus — Lola Petticrew, especially. As Dolours Price, an IRA volunteer during the Troubles, Petticrew brings layers of intense conviction, cheeky confidence, and heartbreaking awareness to a soldier who's resolved to her fate, and gives all of herself anyway.

Her category was tough to crack, but she deserved to be in there. Instead, “Say Nothing” only earned one nomination: a much-deserved slot in Best Writing in a Limited Series or Movie. 

One of the best-reviewed new series of 2025, “Common Side Effects” snagged a coveted Best Animated Program slot. In recent years, voters have broadened their horizons, even if the Best Animated Program category remains in the grip of classics like “The Simpsons” and “Bob's Burgers.” Both of those shows were recognized, as well, but they couldn't stop Joseph Bennett and Steve Hely's buzzy comedy-thriller from breaking through.

When there's only two open slots and two of the contenders are “SNL” (the most awarded Emmy show of all-time with 101 trophies) and “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” (winner of 30 Emmys itself and a perennial victor in the ever-shifting Variety categories), then the other nominees aren't expecting an upset. Still, “Fantasmas” is a fantastic show — imaginative, hilarious, and designed as exquisitely as it is cast. (Where else can you find guest stars Emma Stone, Steve Buscemi, Natasha Lyonne, Paul Dano, Amy Sedaris, and Cole Escola all in one place?) Excluding it in favor of another stale “SNL” season only goes to show how little room the TV Academy makes for new programs, especially the ones that don't fit cleanly in one of the pre-existing categories. But hey, at least it snagged a nomination for Best Hairstyling in a Variety, Nonfiction, or Reality Program.

It might've been a long shot, but who can blame the Emmys for never wanting to leave the Meghann Fahy train? The “White Lotus” alum (and “The Bold Type” if you're a real one) soared in Molly Smith Metzler's limited series in which she plays a woman trying to retrieve her sister from the most deadly cult of all: wealth.

Fahy is one piece of a dynamite cast she represents with this nomination, continuing a streak of sublime performances that deserve recognition. She's in a stacked category with Cate Blanchett, Cristin Milioti, Michelle, Williams, and Rashida Jones, and she couldn't be more worthy. —PK

After a slight resurgence post-pandemic, “The Handmaid's Tale” went out with a whimper. Its final season netted only one nomination, and unlike its previous season, that solo nod wasn't for Elisabeth Moss. (This year, it went to Cherry Jones.) Voters may have drifted back to Gilead when there were fewer new shows to watch, but this performance doesn't bode well for Hulu's sequel series, “The Testaments.”

Some may want to lump “The Four Seasons” into the Snub category, given the fact that Tina Fey and Steve Carell's star power could only muster a single nomination… but a) Fey's latest Netflix creation never built any buzz, which makes it very hard to compete in a crowded comedy field, and b) that single nomination came for Colman Domingo, who's on an enviable and well-deserved awards streak. He's great in “The Four Seasons,” too, and I'll forever think he shares this nomination with his character's many outstanding hats.

Yes, Walton Goggins is doing just fine. Better than ever, you could say, after landing his second straight Emmy nomination (this year for “The White Lotus,” last year for “Fallout”) and third ever. (There was a 13-year gap after his lone nod for “Justified,” another role that certainly deserved greater recognition than the Emmys decided to provide.)

But anyone who's seen Danny McBride's outrageous HBO comedy, “The Righteous Gemstones,” knows Goggins created an all-time sitcom character in Uncle Baby Billy Freeman. Fully committed to the wayward preacher's sins and salvations, Goggins brings an enthralling bite to McBride's distinct vernacular and shapes his movements, posture, and overall presentation in such a specific manner, it's hard to believe Baby Billy isn't real. He's just a figment of the writers' imagination, brought to glorious life by the perfect performer.

That the TV Academy couldn't see fit to nominate him only proves one thing: The TV Academy didn't see him — not outside “The White Lotus,” anyway.

Prior to the Emmy nominations announcement, it was a widely accepted belief that “The Studio” — a TV show about making movies in Hollywood — would do very well. Hollywood stories tend to be popular among Hollywood voters, and “The Studio” benefitted from great reviews, a star-studded cast, and outrageous comedy. 

But did anyone see this coming? With 23 nominations, “The Studio” tied the record for the most nominations by a comedy series in a single season (with “The Bear's” 2024 showing) and broke the record for the most nominations by a freshman comedy series in a single season (shattering “Ted Lasso's” 20 nominations in 2021).  

Among its many recognitions, Martin Scorsese and Ron Howard earned their first acting Emmy nominations, as “The Studio” controlled five of the six Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series slots. (The only non-“Studio” nominee: Jon Bernthal for “The Bear.”)

The second season of HBO's genre hit racked up a lot of noms, including best lead acting nods for Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal (despite his rather limited screen time). 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


The Last of Us season two might have divided fans, but the new episodes were clearly a hit with Television Academy voters. 


HBO‘s post-apocalyptic drama earned 16 Emmy nominations on Tuesday morning. While that's fewer than the first season's 24 noms, it still represents a terrific haul.




	Perhaps the most interesting nomination is that Pedro Pascal was nominated for best actor. While Pascal's performance was widely praised, his character Joel had very limited screen time, appearing in only three of the season's seven episodes. The nomination is similar to Brian Cox's nomination for the final season of HBO's Succession, where his character was killed off in the season's third episode.

	Star Bella Ramsey was nominated for best actress for their portrayal of Ellie for the second season in a row. Plus, the show was also nominated for best drama.

	Several other actors scored Emmy guest actor noms: Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, Jeffrey Wright as Isaac, Kaitlyn Dever as Abby and Catherine O'Hara as Gail.  


	The other Emmy nominations for The Last of Us include best production design, casting, picture editing, contemporary makeup, prosthetic makeup, music supervision, nonfiction short (for a making-of documentary), sound editing, sound mixing and special visual effects.


	Some snubs include Isabela Merced's performance as Gina, the writing categories and the directing categories (particularly Mark Mylod, who helmed the season's second episode, “Through the Valley,” which was the episode submitted for four of the received nominations).

	











	Here's a list of nominations in key categories for the 77th annual Emmy Awards.

	In the midst of celebrating the 13 nominations for The Pitt, Noah Wyle addressed the exit of Tracy Ifeachor.


	The actress who portrayed Dr. Collins in Season 1 announced last week that she would not be returning to the HBO Max drama but said “what a blessing” to participate. She called it an “absolute privilege to play Dr. Heather Collins in such a groundbreaking season and piece.” 


	Wyle acknowledged to Deadline that her departure simply came down to story.


	“I mean, we've all been sort of amused by the speculation about what everybody thinks might be a reason,” the actor continued. “But truthfully, we loved the actress. We enjoyed having her with us very much. She's gotten really big and we will miss her.” 

	











	Collins suffered a miscarriage halfway through the first season and was absent from the final episodes. It was implied early on that she and Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch's (Noah Wyle) were once in a relationship.




			Watch on Deadline		







	On Tuesday, HBO Max's hit The Pitt earned 13 nominations on Tuesday, including nods for Outstanding Drama and Outstanding Actor for Noah Wyle.

	Production is underway on Season 2 of Max's medical drama The Pitt, which is shot on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, CA with exteriors shot on location in Pittsburgh, PA. Season 2 will premiere in January 2026.

John Goodman turned heads at the “Smurfs” premiere with his incredible transformation, showcasing the results of his life-changing 200-pound weight loss journey.

The 73-year-old actor stepped onto the red carpet at Paramount Pictures Studios in Los Angeles on Sunday, July 13, looking healthier and happier than ever in a sharp navy blue suit, brown loafers, and patterned tie. Goodman's appearance at the event showed the amazing physical change he's achieved through years of hard work and lifestyle changes.

At his heaviest, Goodman weighed 392 pounds before beginning his fitness journey in 2007. His commitment to health and wellness has been a gradual process, involving multiple elements including dietary changes, regular exercise, and sobriety.

The beloved actor voices Papa Smurf in the upcoming animated musical film, which features an impressive cast including Rihanna, James Corden, Nick Offerman, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, and Hannah Waddingham. The movie hits theaters on July 18, marking another big moment in Goodman's continued acting career alongside his personal health success.

Goodman's weight loss strategy involved working closely with personal trainer Mackie Shilstone, who helped him develop a comprehensive approach to health and fitness. The program focused on sustainable changes rather than temporary solutions, according to Men's Health.

The Mediterranean diet played a central role in Goodman's nutritional transformation. This eating plan emphasizes fish, nuts, olive oil, vegetables, and fruit while reducing processed foods and sugar intake. The actor had previously told People that cutting sugar from his diet helped him drop 100 pounds, demonstrating the impact of targeted dietary modifications.

“It takes a lot of creative energy to sit on your ass and figure out what you're going to eat next,” Goodman shared with the outlet in 2010. “I wanted to live life better.”

His exercise routine became equally important to his success. Goodman committed to working out six days a week, taking 10,000 to 12,000 steps daily and using equipment like elliptical bikes and treadmills. This consistent physical activity helped build the foundation for his long-term weight management.

Addressing his relationship with food, Goodman told ABC in 2016: “I'd have a handful of food and it'd go to my mouth. I was just eating all the time. I was just eating alcoholically.”

One of the most significant aspects of Goodman's transformation involved changing his approach to weight loss itself. He recognized that his previous attempts at rapid weight loss were unsustainable and often led to regaining the weight.

“In the old days, I would take three months out, lose 60 or 70 pounds, and then reward myself with a 6-pack of Bud or whatever and just go back to my old habits,” Goodman explained to ABC. “Then this time I wanted to do it slowly, move, exercise. I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore. And it gives me the energy to work, 'cause work is very draining.”

Eliminating alcohol became a crucial component of his lifestyle overhaul. Goodman's decision to pursue sobriety alongside his weight loss efforts addressed multiple health concerns simultaneously and contributed to his overall well-being transformation.

The actor's approach to portion control also evolved significantly. In 2018, he told AARP: “It was basically just portion control and ‘I don't need it.' I was just shoving everything into my mouth.” 

His mindset shift extended beyond just eating habits to encompass his entire relationship with health and wellness. Goodman told Howard Stern in 2016: “I took it slow. I just wanted to change my lifestyle. It's an ongoing process for the rest of my life.”

The actor continues to maintain his healthier lifestyle while pursuing his acting career, recently wrapping up his role as Dan Conner on “The Conners” after the show's seven-season run ended in April 2025.

	The Emmys are beloved among top-tier award shows for announcing their nominations at a reasonable hour, for the most part. Now that all of the nominations are out, this morning there are some initially eupeptic and caffeinated would-be contenders who just didn't get any love from voters at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.


	They might be taking a celebration swig or two at Apple TV+'s Severance, HBO Max's newbie The Pitt, Netflix's Adolescence and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Mendendez Story, plus Season 3 of HBO's The White Lotus right now. Those near-sure bets heard their names repeatedly among the nominations for the sprawling 124 categories for the 77th Primetime Emmys unveiled Tuesday by Brenda Song and Harvey Guillén – as did Dying for Sex‘s Michelle Williams, The Residence's Uzo Adudb, and The Studio's Seth Rogen.

	











	On the other hand, even with the “bit about a bit” banter between the Running Point and What We Do in the Shadows actors, there certainly were some notable absences.

	No surprise that Hacks, The Bear, Slow Horses‘ Gary Oldman — now Sir Gary, actually — and Abbott Elementary are back, and Succession chief Jesse Armstrong made the cut with Mountainhead, but last year's big winner Shōgun isn't in the running this time round with Season 2 still to come from FX.












	For the likes of Andor's Diego Luna, Poker Face's Natasha Lyonne, YouTube and Squid Game, it was pretty clear case of “talk to the hand” from the Cris Abrego-led ATAS. With that, check out our look at those overlooked and a few unexpected noms, and tell us who you think we may have missed.


	And remember, hosted by Nate Bargatze, the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards will air live on CBS on September 14 from the Peacock Theater (which is a bit of unique cross-branding) in Los Angeles.

SQUID GAMEThe rules are no game, and the fact that one of the biggest and most compelling series of the 21st century isn't even in the running for the big prize is not playing fair.


SELENA GOMEZThere is a lot more than than murder going on in the building this morning.


DIEGO LUNAThe Andor actor literally risked it all to bring down the Empire in Tony Gilroy's epic and wonderfully dense Disney+ Star Wars series' final season. There are a lot of quips to make about the Force not being strong with the TV Academy today, but the truth is there is do and do not – and voters foolishly didn't.

	The most watched platform around made some major Emmy moves this season with the sizzling Hot Ones, Good Mythical Morning and Challenge Accepted. Not calling the TV Academy voters old fashioned and out of touch, but notice how none of that trio are among the nominees Tuesday?

JON HAMMBoth robbing from the rich to live like the rich in Apple TV+'s Your Friends & Neighbors and truly taking one for the oil baron team in Landman didn't dig deep for the ATAS crowd. One of the industry's hardest-working, most talented and charming actors, and a past Mad Man winner, should have broken into those ballot boxes to get the justice he deserved.

ELISABETH MOSSFrom its big beginning to this year's final season, The Handmaid's Tale was rightly never easy to watch, but its star's fight for the truly good fight was a thing to behold. Unless you are a TV Academy voter who wants to look away from hard truths that feel less like fiction every day and a great swan-song performance.

SETH MEYERSWhen it comes to the past nominee Late Night with Seth Meyers being overlooked this morning, my colleague Peter White put it best earlier Tuesday. Getting up before dawn to snag the Reality Competition and Talk Series categories, Deadline's Executive Editor, TV encapsulated a hard truth: “The tragic reduction of the number late-night shows nominated for Emmys has hit Seth Meyers.”

No noms for Running point in comedy and multiple noms The Bear as a comedy says everything about what's wrong with the process and the criteria.

Seems not just the Academy but all of the awards shows seem to be snubbing Taylor Sheridan and all of his shows which this has been happening for years but yet no one has made a fuss about it like they do when others get snubbed.  Yeah 1923 got several small nominations but they were in lesser known categories that most people don't even realize are there.  Seems odd that one of the most viewed shows Yellowstone didn't even get any nominations in their final season even though they qualified and that could just be because the Academy was upset with Kevin Costner leaving but the show even without Kevin got record numbers so that should have not made a difference.

Glad Four Seasons didn't get nominated. The Four Seasons got so much press — but I couldn't understand why.  Not one likable character on that show. Horrible rich shallow people with no problems whining about their lives.

What about House ot The Dragon totally ignored? I can buy Season 2 was not universally loved, but so was The Bear Season 3, with its worst season to date.

Not one single nomination for THE PERFECT COUPLE?
Especially Donna Lynne Champlin?
And not one mention of the show in an article about snubs?
Talk about a snub.

	Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave “the inside story” about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America's biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. 


	The official spoke in January at the exclusive Consumers' Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event.


	Brent Webster, the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, recalled how his office moved to cut off lucrative bond business to Wells Fargo. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor's mansion with Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton, and the bank's execs, told the bank Texas could “reinstate the bond market” if it left the Net Zero Banking Alliance.


	When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank's executives they were this close “to being sued right now.”  

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, “you guys might be next.” It worked: “They left a week later,” he said. “They left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and then all the banks followed.” 


	On the plus side for the banks, once they left the alliance, Paxton allowed them to get municipal bond business again. 

	











	Paxton's office did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.


	In a statement, Consumers' Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is “appalled at the lengths that Wall Street's financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,” adding that “we are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton's office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. If big banks and asset managers like BlackRock think that they can intimidate those who oppose their misdeeds into silence … they are mistaken.”

	Consumers' Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. The organization and Leo have worked in coalition with Republican attorneys general, state financial officers, legislators, and national Republican groups to pressure businesses to drop public commitments to ensuring the future habitability of our planet. 


	Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives' “war on woke.” 


	Of course, corporate climate pledges, like the one from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and ESG were nowhere close to solving the global climate crisis. The banks never stopped funding the fossil fuel industry. That hasn't stopped conservatives — ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests — from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action.

	Webster made clear how easy it is to weaponize the legal apparatus of the state to bring the financial industry to its knees. He urged his allies to do the same: “Anybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power … states should be ramping up right now.”


	As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. 

	











	They have led an efficient and thorough campaign. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. 


	Texas, for instance, passed the nation's first law banning banks from the municipal bond business if they are found to be discriminating against the fossil fuel industry. 


	Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch “unsubstantiated” attacks “against climate initiatives,” as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters.


	“At bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,” they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers' Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas' antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. 


	Hild wanted more information — the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, “within weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,” big banks like Wells Fargo “start dropping like flies” from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, “We're not recording this, right? … Please don't quote me, because I'm telling the inside story on this.”


	He then described the leverage he had against Wall Street: potential enforcement actions that could end lucrative profit streams for the banks, and the possibility of long, painful lawsuits.


	“They're all deathly afraid of being sued,” Webster said, explaining: “None of them want to be subject to depositions. None of them want to be subject to discovery.”


	Leo's network has long been the top funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which works to elect GOP attorneys general.. Marble Freedom Trust is the primary vehicle through which Leo disburses the $1.6 billion bequeathed to him from billionaire industrialist Barre Seid for the purpose of waging the right-wing movement's culture war. Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo's dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives.


	According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo's Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers' Research. 


	CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. A key cog in Leo's network, the 85 Fund, was listed as the account holder. 

	











	While the 85 Fund moved its corporate registration to Texas in 2023, the planning documents still listed its address in Washington, D.C., at the same building where Leo's organizations have long operated. 


	Consumers' Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. Just six years after its founding, its workers split to form Consumers Union, which produces the well-regarded Consumer Reports magazine. Meanwhile, Consumers' Research would denounce unions as communist and the group became a shill for the tobacco industry. 


	The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo's agenda. 


	Since 2020, Consumers' Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and “woke capitalism,” with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street.   


	Some of the anti-ESG coalition's biggest partners were in attendance at the Consumers' Research summit, including representatives from ALEC, Heritage Action, and SFOF. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. 


	According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC's largest known donor in 2023. The same year, Hild, Consumers' Research's director, said that Consumers' Research was the largest donor to SFOF. 


	For the past several years, as the Biden administration pursued greater action on climate change, Wall Street sought both to hedge its financial risks, and profit from new financial products touting ESG investing and diversity, equity, and inclusion — marketing them to the climate and socially conscious consumer.


	ESG assesses a company or investment decisions through a sustainability framework, in order to bolster long-term growth and reduce harm. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency.  


	Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. 


	Take for example, a chief target of the Leo coalition — BlackRock, the biggest pension fund manager in the world, with $12.5 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock has been at the forefront of ESG evangelism, while at the same time holding $400 billion in fossil fuel industry investments. 

	











	Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. 


	On a broader level, of course, allowing for maximum climate devastation will be both immensely costly for the citizens of Earth, as well as for business interests.


	At one point at the Consumers' Research summit, Webster spoke about the push to have Republican-led states end any investments with BlackRock, arguing that currently, “red states are funding the war against us.”


	Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems' finances.


	“The biggest problem we have right now is both of our retirement funds, and I'm sure, I'm glad I'm not being quoted here, but they do not have the courage to stand up to BlackRock,” he said.


	He argued that's why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

	“That's the only way we're going to change this system,” he said. “I'll tell you right now, the pension funds in the red states and the bond market in the red states is larger than anything BlackRock has. You have more power than you have ever realized.” 


	Webster continued, “All of their security comes from your pensions and your bond markets. That's where the security for their risky investments come from. If you mess with their security, they have to change their entire business model.”

HBO and its streaming service HBO Max smashed past Netflix to once again lead the number of Emmy nominations, thanks to hauls from shows including The Penguin, The White Lotus and The Last of Us.


	The Warner Bros. Discovery network scored 142 Emmy nominations, compared to 121 for Netflix.


	This marks the most Emmy nominations HBO has ever received in a single year, beating its previous total of 137 in 2019. Last year, it received 91 and was behind Netflix and FX. 


	It was helped in large part by major hauls from The Penguin, which landed 24 nominations – the second most of the year behind Apple's Severance, which got 27, The White Lotus, which checked in with 23, and The Last Of Us, which got 16. Hacks helped with 14 nominations and The Pitt looked after 13 nominations.

	Netflix won't be unhappy, however, beating its 107 nominations from last year to put it in second place, thanks to big mornings for Adolescence, which got 13, 11 noms for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and 10 for Black Mirror.


	Apple also had a great morning, scoring 79 nominations thanks to 27 noms for Severance and 23 noms for The Studio. If you add commercials, the company added two more noms. 


	Disney scored 128 nominations across all of its platforms including ABC, Disney+, FX, Hulu and Nat Geo. Disney+ grew from 19 nominations last year to 28 nods this year thanks to a massive haul from Andor as well as some love for Agatha All Along and some documentaries such as Beatles '64.

The singer's "Ordinary" blocked the rapper's "What Did I Miss?" from debuting in the top spot.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	It's no ordinary day when one of the biggest rappers in the world calls you out, but Alex Warren is taking Drake‘s recent diss in stride.


	In response to Drizzy's comments about the TikToker's smash hit “Ordinary” blocking the former's “What Did I Miss?” from debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week, Warren posted a tongue-in-cheek video of himself Monday (July 14) on Instagram Stories. In the clip, he dances along to Drake's “Nokia,” staring innocently into the camera as he shakes his hips to the lyrics, “Baby girl/ Let me see you do your dance, let me see you twirl.” 


	In lieu of a caption, Warren simply tagged Drake's username. “Nokia” also happens to have never reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, debuting at No. 10 in March before eventually climbing to No. 2 the following month.

	











	Warren's response comes shortly after the Canadian superstar expressed his disappointment with debuting at No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart dated July 19. On his Story, Drake wrote earlier on Monday, “Suppressor on the 1 spot.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I'm taking that soon don't worry one song or another,” he added at the time, sharing a graphic of the U.S. chart's top 10, which showed “What Did I Miss?” sitting just below Warren's “Ordinary” at No. 1. 


	Though Drake may not be happy with the position of “What Did I Miss?” on the charts this week, the track still earned him a record-extending 81st top 10 hit on the Hot 100. He also now has 359 total entries on the ranking, more than any other artist in history.


	Plus, “Ordinary” has proven pretty hard to beat. Warren's breakthrough hit has spent a total of six weeks in the top spot, dethroned only temporarily by Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” spending one week at No. 1 in late June.

	











	Warren is currently fresh off the release of “On My Mind” with ROSÉ, which followed his Jelly Roll duet, “Bloodline.” Both tracks will appear on Warren's new album, You'll Be Alright, Kid, which drops Friday (July 18).

Bella Ramsey received their second Emmy nomination Tuesday morning, making history as the first non-binary performer to earn more than one nom from the Television Academy.


	Ramsey is one of five nominees in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for their performance as Ellie in Season 2 of HBO‘s The Last of Us. They also were nominated for the same role at the 75th Emmy Awards in 2023.


The Last of Us scored 16 nominations for the upcoming 77th Emmy Awards, bringing the series' total to 40 across two seasons. The series won eight golden statuettes in 2024.


	There have been few openly non-binary and transgender performers to be nominated at the Emmy Awards. In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson declined to submit for the acting categories at the Emmys because the categories are separated to recognize male and female actors separately.

	In recent years, gender non-conforming actors have increasingly advocated for the elimination of gendered categories at award shows. However, Ramsey recently defended gendered awards categories, explaining that they felt it was important “recognition for women in the industry is preserved.”


	Based on Naughty Dog's award-winning video game, The Last of Us takes place 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal and heartbreaking journey as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.

	











	Season 2 picks up five years after the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.

	The 15-year-old is the youngest ever nominee in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Anthology Series or Movie category at the Primetime Emmy Awards.


	He surpasses current record-holder Scott Jacoby, who was 16 years old when he was nominated for 1972 TV movie That Certain Summer.


	Cooper had never worked as an actor before auditioning for Adolescence, the one-shot drama directed by Philip Barantini.

The switch-up comes months after the pop star left her longtime manager Roger Gold earlier this year.


							By 

	Ethan Millman

Camila Cabello has new management, as the the pop star has signed on with Full Stop Management, a source familiar with the matter confirms to The Hollywood Reporter. 


	Cabello will be managed by Jeffrey Azoff,  Tina Kennedy, Maria Chon and Gian Mitchell, the latter of whom came over with Cabello from previous management. Cabello officially joined Full Stop last month. The move comes months after Cabello had parted ways with her longtime manager Roger Gold, who also co-founded the record label 300 Entertainment. With Full Stop — the superstar management company headed by Irving and Jeffrey Azoff  — Cabello joins a stacked roster that also includes Harry Styles, Tate McRae, John Mayer and U2 among others.

	A rep for Cabello couldn't be reached. Cabello just wrapped a successful European leg of her Yours, C tour in Europe, and she will continue the tour with dates in Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia and Brazil from August through September 14. 




			Related Video		







	Cabello's new management deal comes just over a year after she released her fourth solo album, C, XOXO, back in June of 2024. That album was her first at Universal Music‘s Interscope after she departed from Sony's Epic Records, which had released her three other solo albums. C, XOXO debuted at Number 13 on Billboard's 200 Albums chart, her only album to open outside of the top 10.

	











	Cabello remains the most successful solo act from the girl group Fifth Harmony, where she got her start after the group formed on The X Factor back in 2012. She left the group in 2016. Cabello's first two solo albums are both platinum-certified and had the massive hits “Havana” featuring Young Thug and “Señorita” with Shawn Mendes, both of which have surpassed at least 2 billion streams on Spotify. 


	As Cabello moves into a new chapter in her career, there could be movement from the rest of her former Fifth Harmony members as well. As THR first reported back in May, the group, minus Cabello, have been in talks to reunite, with a tour and documentary potentially in the works.

Director Steven Leckart uses the film, which will stream on Paramount+, to explore fandom at its best and worst. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	A new documentary about rapper legend Eminem is headed for a limited run on the big screen.


AMC Theatres has come aboard to distribute Stans in the U.S., and has committed to playing the doc in more than 135 of its domestic locations beginning Aug. 7 and ending Aug. 10. Overseas, Trafalgar Releasing will release the doc at the same time in more than 1,600 theaters across 50 markets.




	The pact follows in the wake of AMC directly distributing Taylor Swift's concert pic The Eras Tour and Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé.

	The Eminem-produced doc (trailer, below) opened the inaugural London edition of the SXSW festival earlier this year, and is inspired by the artist's 2000 iconic song “Stan,” about an obsessive, unstable fan who takes his admiration for the rapper too far.

	In London, director Steven Leckart described how he flipped the music documentary format on its head. Stans film follows not just the musician's artistic trajectory but that of his most loyal superfans, with the doc “offering an entertaining and vibrant look at the modern nature of fandom and how social media has irrevocably changed the relationship between artists and their audience.” (The term “Stan” was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017).


	Leckart said after the premiere during a Q&A: “I was raised on hip-hop in the '80s and '90s, and I grew up on MTV. So I witnessed [Eminem's] rise's first hand and I was a fan, but I think I just kept coming back to the song ‘Stan' and really thinking about how unconventional it was and still is.”

	











	He continued: “I just saw an opportunity to make an unconventional doc … We've seen a glut of docs that are just so straightforward and standard. And so this is a beautiful opportunity to do something different.”


	Other producers include Paul Rosenberg, Stuart Parr, Antoine Fuqua, Tony DiSanto, David Schiff with DIGA Studios in association with Shady Films, Fuqua Films, Interscope Films, and MTV Entertainment Studios.  Bruce Gillmer, Amanda Culkowski and Michael Maniaci are Executive Producers for MTV Entertainment Studios.


Stans will be available on Paramount+ internationally later this year. Stans: The Official Soundtrack, which will feature previously unreleased tracks, is already available for pre-order.

BBC Studios is “really committed to Doctor Who and is continuing to look at ways in which we can bring the show to fans,” according to its CEO Tom Fussell. 


	Speaking after the publication of the BBC Annual Report, Fussell stressed the “crucial” nature of BBC Studios' partnership with Disney along with the strength of Doctor Who, coming with the BBC-Disney+ Doctor Who deal hanging in the balance and following eyebrow-raising comments from ex-Doctor Ncuti Gatwa over the weekend.


	“Fans love the Doctor Who brand,” Fussell said today. “It's been that way since before I was in short trousers.”

	Fussell celebrated Disney as a “key partner of ours” that works with BBC Studios on hits including Bluey, Dancing with the Stars, Tucci in Italy and “a decade's worth of natural history.” “They are a crucial partner and we share a lot of the same values so I'm really proud of the way that relationship has worked,” he added.




			Watch on Deadline		







Doctor Who has been in the spotlight since Russell T Davies' regenerated second season of the sci-fi series aired to below-par ratings and some middling reviews, leading to fevered speculation that Disney+ will not extend the splashy co-pro deal beyond two seasons, which is currently up for discussion. Over the weekend, 32-year-old Gatwa told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Show he is “getting old” and “my body was tired” when queried over why he left Doctor Who after two seasons. While calling it “the most amazing job in the world,” Gatwa described Doctor Who as “strenuous” and said it “takes a lot out of you physically, emotionally and mentally.” 

	











	One of BBC Studios' strongest relationships with Disney is over Bluey, America's most-streamed show, which BBC Studios said today helped drive record revenue and profit of £2.2B and £228M respectively for the commercial arm.


	Fussell said BBC Studios' move to finance the upcoming Bluey movie is “one of the biggest investments” made during his tenure.


	He pointed to other recent success stories such as the £255M acquisition of the half of BritBox International that BBC Studios didn't own.


	BritBox itself delivered big profits last year – driving a plus-40% soar in revenue for BBC Studios' media and streaming division – and Fussell said the best-of-British streamer has a “unique ability” to help the BBC by acting as co-producer on shows like Ludwig and The Other Bennet Sister.


	“Our mandate is very clear, we are there to make longer-term sustainable growing financial returns and to use the BBC's values as a way of doing that,” he added. “[BritBox] has that added advantage of being a very powerful route to market for British shows, which would be very hard to fund if it wasn't for BritBox.”


	More direct-to-consumer plays in a similar vein to BritBox or the powerplay to charge American audiences for news content could be incoming soon, according to Fussell, with today's Annual Report saying  BBC Studios is “working actively to further develop direct routes to market as part of a strategy to establish sustainable growth for the business” amid “challenging trading conditions.”


	Fussell acknowledged that what the BBC has termed a scripted funding crisis is a consequence of those “challenging conditions” and said “the industry needs a bit of help” to overcome the problem, which he added is not just limited to the drama genre.


	“I would go back and say it hit kids and family first, then UK comedy, now it's hitting drama and natural history is also a challenge,” he added. “Our job is to take risks and our producers are doing amazingly at pivoting our budgets to get them down a bit. Smart people are looking to pivot their slates to get them back into the sweet spot of [shows costing] between £1M and £3M per hour because that's probably where you have to go, but even then it's hard.” 


	BBC Studios returned £391M to the BBC last year and is well on track to hit its £1.5B five-year returns target by 2026-27, Fussell said.

The makers of Doctor Who need to remember what type of show it was that allowed it to run for decades- it was SCARY! Generations of viewers were frightened by it! Now it's silly and glossy colours.
If the BBC wants the show to continue, it needs to be brave and frighten children (and some grown ups) again!

Gatwa's comments about being too old are ridiculous when you consider he's one of the younger actors and one actor 20 years older than him – Peter Capaldi – stayed with the show even after undergoing knee surgery and would have stayed longer had the new producer not decided to change the show fundamentally.

Indeed.

Capaldi is 67.

Gatwa is just 32.

EXCLUSIVE: Chris Pine (Star Trek), Lily-Rose Depp (Nosferatu), Kelvin Harrison Jr. (Mufasa: The Lion King), and Doona Bae (Rebel Moon) are new additions to the cast of Alpha Gang, the alien invasion comedy from the Zellner Brothers (Sasquatch Sunset).


	Character details are under wraps. As previously announced, Cate Blanchett, Léa Seydoux, Dave Bautista, and Riley Keough will also star. 


	When the project was announced in October 2024, Channing Tatum, Zoë Kravitz, and Steven Yeun were also in the ensemble, though they've since fallen out for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Sources attributed it to a combination of factors including scheduling that are constantly in flux for a great many indie film packages.

	











Alpha Gang follows a group of alien invaders sent to conquer Earth. Disguised in human form as a 1950s leather-clad biker gang, they are ruthless in their mission… until they succumb to the most toxic and contagious human condition of all: emotion.

	The Zellner brothers are producing for ZBi, along with Blanchett and Coco Francini for Dirty Films, Keough and Gina Gammell for Felix Culpa, Ryan Zacarias for Fat City, Andrea Bucko for Sugar Rush Pictures, Mary Aloe for Aloe Entertainment, and Joshua Harris for Peachtree Media Partners.


	mk2 films is repping international sales, having launched pre-sales last year at the AFM, with CAA Media Finance representing North American distribution rights.


	Best known for starring as Captain Kirk in the recent Star Trek films, Pine is coming off of projects like his directorial debut Poolman, Don't Worry Darling, and Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, and is represented by CAA and Gendler, Kelly & Cunningham.

	











	Most recently garnering critical acclaim for her starring role opposite Nicholas Hoult and Bill Skarsgård in Robert Eggers' Nosferatu, Depp is repped by CAA, Markham, Froggatt & Irwin, Agence Adequat, and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols.


	Recently tapped for the role of Beetee in The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, Harrison Jr. is coming off turns in films like O'Dessa, Mufasa: The Lion King, Chevalier and Elvis, as well as the Nat Geo series Genius: MLK/X. Also soon to be seen playing Jean-Michel Basquiat in the indie Samo Lives, he is repped by WME, Anonymous Content, and Del Shaw Moonves.


	A South Korean star with credits like Jupiter Ascending, Sense8, and Rebel Moon, Bae is represented by WME and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

Cannes 2025 festival-goers put their stamp of approval of Harris Dickinson the filmmaker, with his directing debut “Urchin” winning the FIPRESCI prize out of Un Certain Regard. What can't the “Babygirl” and “Triangle of Sadness” and “Beach Rats” and “The Iron Claw” actor and future John Lennon star do? 

A favorite of IndieWire's Screen Talk podcast and Chief Film Critic David Ehrlich, “Urchin” seemed primed for a major scoop out of Cannes alongside other actor-turned-filmmakers (Kristen Stewart's “Chronology of Water,” still without a buyer, and Scarlett Johansson's “Eleanor the Great,” set up at Sony Pictures Classics and, we're guessing, next poised for a TIFF bow).

Alas, it took two months since the festival's end for rising distribution outfit 1-2 Special to step in and buy Dickinson's film for North American distribution. Starring Frank Dillane as an unhoused, drug-chasing drifter in London, and in the vein of Mike Leigh's “Naked” in terms of toxic emotional candor, “Urchin” follows Mike (Dillane) as he tumbles through a cycle of addiction, self-destruction, and London's correctional system. In addition to the FIPRESCI prize, Dillane also won a Best Performance award out of Un Certain Regard. (IndieWire's Anne Thompson even deemed Dillane a potential Oscar contender.)

Per a release on July 15, 1-2 Special will release “Urchin” in theaters this fall. Expect to play the gamut of fall festivals as word-of-mouth builds, and Dickinson's viral star keeps rising (especially since “Babygirl”).

Producer Archie Pearch said, “We're incredibly excited to have 1-2 Special on board as our North American distributor. Their bold, distinctive slate and deep passion for the film make them the ideal partner to help us connect with audiences across North America. As a new company ourselves, we recognized a kindred spirit in their entrepreneurial passion.”

Launched this past February ahead of the Berlinale by Sideshow co-founding executive Jason Hellerstein, 1-2 Special has launched with a suite of intriguing buys this year. The distributor is firmly in the Radu Jude business, with North American rights to the Romanian director's Silver Bear winner “Kontinental 25” and upcoming Locarno premiere “Dracula.” There's also Christian Petzold's “Miroirs No. 3,” bought for the U.S. from Metrograph Pictures, and Simón Mesa Soto's Un Certain Regard Jury Prize winner “A Poet” coming up.

“Urchin” was produced by Archie Pearch at Devisio Pictures, with Scott O'Donnell of Somesuch. The film was developed by BBC Film and financed by BBC Film, BFI, and Tricky Knot. Executive Producers are Eva Yates, Ama Ampadu, Alexandra Tynion, and Olivia Tyson.

 










The deal was negotiated by The Gersh Agency, UTA Independent Film Group, and Charades on behalf of the filmmakers with 1-2 Special.

"You would not believe how wasteful this industry is," the pop star says.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Billie Eilish has long been leading the charge against the music industry's negative impact on the environment — and in an interview on an upcoming episode of The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper, the singer-songwriter looks back on the positive changes she's been seeing since she started speaking up.

	











	In an exclusive clip shared with Billboard from the singer's conversation with CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir, Eilish opens up about the culture shock of going from growing up in an eco-conscious household to becoming famous in an industry marked by overabundance and excess. Eilish's mom and fellow climate activist, Maggie Baird, also joins her for the interview.


	“We were meeting different brands, and I was going to go on tour and making perfume and my own clothing line,” Eilish recalls of the early years of her career. “We learned how much unbelievable waste is going on that we don't really know is happening.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We stepped into this other world, and it was a little bit like, ‘Oh my gosh, what is happening here?'” Baird added incredulously. 


	The mother-daughter duo go on to say that the music industry didn't have any sort of “plan” for minimizing its eco footprint back when Eilish first found fame around 2016 — but now, they say it's changing for the better. “You would not believe how wasteful this industry is,” the nine-time Grammy winner says in the clip. “They then started making plans, because we would yell at them. We would demand a plan.”

	











	“I was raised to feel this way, but I think I also have my mom's gene of really caring about the world and animals and not wasting things,” Eilish adds.


	For years, the musician has been a fierce climate advocate. In addition to working with fashion brands such as Nike and Oscar de la Renta to create vegan designs and partnering with environmental nonprofit REVERB on tour, the star launched her very own climate summit, Overheated, in 2022. She's also been a key player in carrying out the initiatives of Support + Feed, an organization founded by Baird in 2020 with a mission to fight climate change and food insecurity.


	Eilish and Baird's segment on The Whole Story echoes what both women previously spoke with Billboard about last year. Recalling how “bleak” it was to take meetings with record label executives who couldn't even speak to their companies' sustainability efforts — or lack thereof — the singer pointed out how wasteful unethically sourced merchandise and album variants can be.


	“It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right, and I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable,” she said at the time. “Then it's some of the biggest artists in the world making f–king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more.”


	In that same interview with Billboard, Baird praised Universal Music Group for coming “a long way” in its environmental practices since Eilish signed to them nearly a decade ago. The live music industry has also been making strides, from Lollapalooza implementing a battery-powered hybrid system for its main stage to Coachella debuting a zero-carbon stage in 2025. 

	











	Eilish is just one of a few musicians featured on the latest installment of The Whole Story, which will premiere at 8 p.m. ET on July 20. Titled “Change Amplified: Live Music and the Climate Crisis,” the episode will also include first-hand accounts from Bonnie Raitt, Jack Johnson, Perry Farrell and AJR's Adam Met about how they're personally working to revolutionize the music industry's approach to environmentalism.

Philadelphia shoegaze band They Are Gutting a Body of Water have announced a lengthy tour and a new album. Lotto, their fourth studio LP, arrives October 17 (via Julia's War/Smoking Room/ATO). Bolstering the record is new single “Trainers,” which comes with a Ben Turok–directed video. Check it out below.

What began as the solo project of singer Doug Dulgarian has since been expanded into a proper four-piece, with bassist Emily Lofing, guitarist PJ Carroll, and drummer Ben Opatut joining the fold. Their new LP is billed as a step away from the digital collage work of 2022's Lucky Styles and the compilation Swanlike (Loosies 2020 - 2023), with Dulgarian instead putting the emphasis on his guitar again—as evidenced in “Trainers” and the previously released track “American Food.”

After releasing their new album, They Are Gutting a Body of Water head out on a lengthy North American tour. Beginning on October 30, in Cleveland, Ohio, they will make their way to major cities like Chicago, Denver, Vancouver, Los Angeles,Atlanta, Tornto, and more before ending the run on December 12 in their hometown of Philadelphia. Check out the group's complete list of tour dates below.

	If the immersive, state-of-the-art entertainment venue Sphere didn't already exist, Zac Brown would have had to invent it.


	“I've been wanting to do a spectacle for a couple years,” he tells Billboard. “I've been planning to figure out how to do something where the production and the fan experience is just on [another] level. And then in my planning for doing that, I heard about the Sphere and toured the building while it was under construction. I was like, ‘This is the place…' The Sphere is the greatest canvas that's ever been created for imagination.”


	A little more than two years after Sphere opened in September 2023 with U2, Brown and his Zac Brown Band mates will get their time there with Love & Fear, a four-show limited engagement that coincides with the Dec. 5 release of the band's similarly titled, seventh full-length album. The Sphere dates are Dec. 5-6 and Dec. 12-13. When asked if he anticipates more concerts being added, Brown simply says, “Yes.”

	Last week, the band scrubbed their socials and hinted that a new chapter was coming, posting on Instagram, “There's no way to sum up what the last chapter has meant to us…The next chapter? It's the biggest one yet.”  Then on Monday (July 14), the band posted the dramatic cover of the Love & Fear album, which features what looks like a battle between a mythical angel and devil, with the message, “Two sides of the same truth.”

	Brown calls the Sphere appearance and the new album “2.0 for our band. There's some bands, they keep going for a while and then they kind of get tired, they stop,” he says. “But my passion and my creativity is as good now as it's ever been, and I just want to keep pushing the envelope of what our band is capable of and bringing our fans along for the ride… This is our chance to show that we're not slowing down. We've actually got our foot on the gas.”

	











	The Grammy-winning band, who has landed five albums on top of Billboard's Country Albums chart, began working on the album two-and-half years ago and then creating the visuals for the Sphere run began 14 months ago. “Every single detail of [the] show is going to be extremely memorable,” Brown says. He promises the performance will (in a good way) “make people's eyes bleed and make them feel every range of the human emotion that we're capable of.”


	The album, which the band is self-releasing, and the show tell the story of Brown's life. “You know, I've never really told the story of my life to anyone that doesn't know me really well,” the Georgia native says, “and so this is a chance to get to do all of those things.”


	The album's first track, “I Ain't Worried About It,” is already out, while a new track, “Let It Run” (feat. Snoop Dogg), will come out Friday (July 18). The album also features Dolly Parton and Marcus King.


	Brown goes so far as to call Love & Fear “one of our masterpieces, and the amount of work we put into that is incredible, from having a 40-piece orchestra [to] having a 20-piece choir.” He says that same detail has gone into the enveloping experience the band has created for Sphere. The symphony's parts for the Sphere show were recorded on the Sphere stage and will be incorporated into the visuals, Brown says.


	Brown, who has seen Phish, Eagles and Anyma at the venue, says the process of planning the show has been all-consuming. “Our challenge for ourselves is to raise the bar. You're only limited to your imagination and your budget,” he says. “It's this massive creative mountain, but I absolutely love it, and I'm obsessed with it. You're kind of building the plane as you're flying it.”

	











	The show will take attendees on a journey, featuring around six songs from the new album with many of the multi-platinum group's hits reimagined in a way that builds a cohesive story, Brown says.


	He says he has no hesitation about revealing so much of himself in the album and show. “I think that's what makes our humanity,” he says. “As an artist, you're naked on a fence anyway and people can either say, ‘That's amazing,' or they can throw rotten vegetables at you. But that's a risk that you have to be willing to take. I'm unapologetically musically going to do the things that I feel like I'm led to do. It's just an expression of my life and my influences and the things that happened. If you don't know who you are, the music industry will chew you up and spit you out the other side. You've got to fight hard for who you are.”


	The band limited its touring to develop the album and show and to encourage fans to come to Sphere—ZBB only has a handful of Australian dates in October between now and the Vegas run. 


	“I'm pulling every favor from every friend that I have on the planet for this album and the Sphere,” he says. “Because of the contract with the Sphere, you can't really go out and tour, so all the money we'd be making touring, we're just kind of betting on ourselves and investing all the money it takes to create it all. I want to step things up, and this is a time for us to do it, and this is the venue we're going to do it in. This is the album that's going to help us to get there.”


	After the Sphere run, Brown, plans to take the Love & Fear show on the road. Though certain elements will only work in the Vegas attraction, the themes will be adapted and carried over to more conventional venues.  

	











	“We're having to build all of our staging and all of our lighting and everything that's going into the Sphere, so we will be able to bring those pieces out on the road,” Brown says. “But the level of detail and amount of time and energy that's gone into creating the video content [for Sphere], it just won't be on as grand of a canvas [on the road.]  I mean, the Sphere is like a modern marvel.”


	Tickets to Love & Fear go on sale to the general public on July 25 at 10 a.m. PT at ZacBrownBand.com. Travel VIP packages, which include a concert ticket and two-night stay at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas are available now at ZacBrownBand.com. All other VIP packages will be on sale July 21 at 10 a.m. PT.

Late on July 12th, fans of Jeff Lynne's Electric Light Orchestra were devastated to learn that the iconic musician was canceling what was to be his very final show at the BST Hyde Park festival. Lynne's management reported that he was suffering from an infection that had spread throughout his body. 

“Jeff Lynne is heartbroken to report that he will not be able to perform at tomorrow's BST Hyde Park show,” BST Hyde Park's Instagram page read. “Jeff has been battling a systemic infection and is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule.” 

A post shared by BST Hyde Park (@bsthydepark)

Unfortunately for fans hoping to see Steve Winwood, the Doobie Brothers, or the other acts scheduled to perform on July 13th, it didn't happen. BST decided to cancel the entire last day after Lynne announced that he would be unable to attend.

ELO also pulled out of their second-to-last performance at Manchester's Co-Op Live on July 10, minutes before showtime. After that, fans began to worry that the last show was also in jeopardy. A fan who had attended their show on July 9th reported that Lynne wasn't doing so well.

“Well I have just come out from the ELO concert and what can I say. Jeff Lynne had to be helped onto the stage…..he was missing his cues, forgetting words and almost collapsed two thirds of the way through the concert,” Andy Linehan wrote on Facebook. “They had to bring him a chair and he was struggling to stay on it. By the end of the concert the band had to sing Mr Blue Sky for him and his backing singers looked visibly shaken up. At the concert end the crew rushed onto the stage to help him off.”

Lynne first announced the BST Hyde Park Final Show in October 2024. He was excited because it was a full-circle moment for him.

“My return to touring began at Hyde Park in 2014”, Jeff Lynne wrote on Instagram. “It seems like the perfect place to do our final show. We couldn't be more excited to share this special night in London with our UK fans. As the song goes, ‘we're gonna do it One More Time!'” 

A post shared by Jeff Lynne's ELO (@jefflynneselo)

Leading up to the final show of the Electric Light Orchestra's 55-year career, Lynne had already suffered another setback, which he explained to the crowd at his show in Birmingham.

“I was riding in a taxi in London, who slammed on its brakes to avoid an accident, and I broke my hand,” he told the crowd. “That's why I can't play guitar tonight.”

“But nothing could keep me away from you tonight,” he added.

On July 14th, Lynne posted an Instagram story with the caption, “Today at the Rose Garden in Hyde Park,” and featured a crowd of people singing ELO's hit song, “Mr. Blue Sky.” “Thank you,” he wrote.

As is typically the case on Mondays, there is a lot of news—way more than can fit into a single Daily Show. For instance, earlier today, the Supreme Court decided to uphold President Trump's order to lay off 1,400 employees of the Department of Education, clearing the way for Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the Department. Meanwhile, less than a week after Grok's big antisemitic tear, Elon Musk's xAI company, the makers of his so-called MechaHitler, scored a $200 million contract with the Department of Defence. They're also making AI girlfriends for people to descend into AI psychosis with. Ka-ching. Pumps fist. Cries in mirror. If that wasn't bad enough, as The A.V. Club covered earlier today, Sesame Street resident Elmo went rogue yesterday, as hackers took over Elmo's X account and began posting about, you guessed it, the Epstein client list and the Jews.

Jon Stewart hosted Elmo on tonight's show, which was initially supposed to be about the tariffs. Remember those? Trump added a 17% tax to Mexican tomatoes today. But instead, Stewart did an extended riff about Elmo getting radicalized by the manosphere because he is a victim of the Male Loneliness Epidemic. The truth does, in fact, hurt.



But the crux of the show focused on the fissure in MAGA world regarding the closing of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The release of the Epstein Client list is a big deal in Trump's world, with many of the workers within his cottage industry of conspiracy theories believing it to be the linchpin toward taking down that secret cabal of pedophiles they're obsessed with. MAGA luminaries like Glenn Beck, Jesse Watters, and Lauren Ingraham have already publicly criticized the administration for its sudden about-face on the subject. So Trump decided to post through it, asking his “boys” and, in some cases, his “gals” to go back to worrying about other conspiracy theories, like Hunter Biden's laptop. It didn't work, and as such, his movement is in revolt for the time being. Basking in schadenfreude, Stewart delighted in telling America's red states that his new pronouns are “how does” and “my ass taste?”

“The Trump that you're just experiencing now, to your deep disappointment and dismay, is the dude we've been dealing with the whole fucking time,” Stewart says in tonight's show. “You just didn't realize it because he's been nice to you.”

“Whatever you need, Daddy's here because you're the child he wanted, but we're Eric.” Again, the truth hurts.

A suspect stole "water marked music, some unreleased music, footage plans for the show and past and future set lists," according to an Atlanta Police incident report.

	Unreleased Beyoncé music and other sensitive documents have been stolen in Atlanta after thieves allegedly broke into a rental car for the superstar's choreographer and one of her dancers last week. 


	According to an incident report reviewed by The Hollywood Reporter, the alleged theft took place on the evening of July 8, less than two days before Beyoncé started her four-night run at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Per the report, choreographer Christopher Grant and dancer Diandre Blue told authorities that they parked their rental car at a parking deck and left at just past 8 p.m., and that by the time they came back an hour later, they saw someone had broken in through the trunk and took two suitcases.

	The suspect had stolen hard drives that contained “water marked music, some un-released music, footage plans for the show and past and future set lists.” Also stolen were various clothing items, AirPods Max headphones and MacBook laptops.

	According to Atlanta's local ABC affiliate WSB-TV, which first reported the news of the theft, Atlanta Police have also issued a warrant for a suspect's arrest. Per the APD, police dusted the rental car and found two prints. A security camera caught video of the incident. According to the incident report, police used Find My to track the location of the AirPods and laptops, leading authorities to locations redacted on the report. One of the officers wrote in the report that they'd conducted a “suspicious person stop” in the area the AirPods were pinging from.

	











	The theft isn't the first bit of drama to hit the Cowboy Carter Tour these past few weeks; last month, one of Beyoncé's hometown Houston shows was briefly paused after a scary malfunction with her prop car caused the vehicle to tilt in midair.


	A representative for Beyoncé didn't respond to THR's request for comment. The singer plays her final Cowboy Carter Atlanta show this evening.

David Kaff, who played keyboardist Viv Savage in Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, has died. His band Mutual of Alameda's Wild Kingdom shared the news to Facebook, writing “David always had a kind word and a quick wit that would slay you where you stand. Then he'd make you smile doing it!” A cause of death was not given, though the statement mentions that Kaff “passed away peacefully in his sleep” on Saturday, July 12. He was 79 years.

Born David Kaffinetti in 1946, Kaff got his start as a founding member of the British psychedelic rock band Rare Bird. The group was among the first to sign to Charisma Records, later the label home of Genesis and Peter Gabriel, and put out five studio albums between 1969 and 1974. Rare Bird's sole UK chart hit, 1970's “Sympathy,” features a prominent organ line courtesy of Kaff. In 1972, Kaff also went into the studio with Chuck Berry for The London Chuck Berry Sessions, which yielded the No. 1 single “My Ding-a-Ling.”

In This Is Spinal Tap, Kaff portrays the frizzy-haired keyboard player in fictional metal band Spinal Tap. Despite a smaller role relative to lead actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, Kaff's Viv Savage left his mark thanks to a combination of physical comedy (especially during the film's staged concert footage) and quotable one-liners. At one point, asked by McKean's David St. Hubbins if he's able to play Nigel Tufnel's (Guest) bassline on “Big Bottom,” Savage quips back, “I've got two hands, yeah I can do it.”

Kaff played on This Is Spinal Tap's accompanying soundtrack and, in May 1984, performed in character alongside his co-stars on Saturday Night Live. He left the group by the end of the year and did not return for the recording of their subsequent studio albums—1992's Break Like the Wind and 2009's Back from the Dead—but continued to play music with Oakland's Model Citizenz and, most recently, psych-rock outfit Mutual of Alameda's Wild Kingdom.

Kaff nonetheless maintained his fondness for Viv Savage over the years, telling BAM in 2011, “I played him very close to my heart… just a little bit dimmer. If people like that character, chances are they'll like me.” Kaff won't appear in Reiner's forthcoming Spinal Tap sequel, but forever holds the distinction of delivering the original film's final line: “Have a good time all the time—that's my philosophy, Marty.”

Kim Kardashian's stepbrother Brody Jenner got married on July 12, 2025. The 41-year-old son of Caitlyn Jenner wed 28-year-old professional surfer Tia Blanco in a lowkey ceremony which took place at the home of his mother, Linda Thompson, per E! News. Thompson is Caitlyn Jenner's second wife, and was married to the gold medalist from 1981 to 1986. The exes share their 44-year-old son Brandon along with Brody.

A post shared by BROSA (@brodyjenner)

Blanco is Brody's first legally official wife, but he previously shared an aesthetically stunning June 2018 wedding ceremony with ex Kaitlynn Carter, which was documented in stunning photography by Mitch Pohl. As you know, Carter later went on to famously date Miley Cyrus from August to September 2019.

People says Brody's famous father did not attend his son's first wedding, and the socialite reacted at the time by saying, “Not having my dad at the wedding, it was a bummer. Honestly, it really did hurt and I would have loved to have had her there.” This time around, the outlet says the gold medalist was present to help Brody celebrate his big day. 

However, one person close to him was notably absent – his longtime friend Spencer Pratt. But there doesn't look to be any bad blood between the pals that led to “The Hills” star missing out on the event. Read on to learn the totally understandable reason Pratt wasn't there.

It turns out Pratt missed his friend's wedding because he had a different ceremony to attend the same day. The father of two took to TikTok to reply to a fan who questioned him, “Why weren't you at Brody's wedding!?” with a simple answer. “Holly had her wedding at the same time,” he wrote, referring to Heidi Montag's sister. 

The 41-year-old, who married his “The Hills” costar Heidi Montag in 2008, accompanied the post with an adorable shot of himself and his two sons all dressed up. Pratt wore a light tan suit while the boys, who Us Weekly says are 7 and 2, sported pastel green vests with matching shorts. As a choice of background music, he used the song “Counting My Blessings” by Seph Schlueter.

One fan reacted to the news by saying, “Awww gotta have a Brody wedding part 2 so you can be there.”

Some fans questioned why Brody chose to attend the wedding even after his prior drama with Holly on “The Hills,” but one pointed out, “Spencer always supports Heidi. Of course he would be at Holly's wedding. They made up years ago.”

A third fan showed support for Spencer's actions, saying, “He did the right thing choosing to attend the one his wife needed to go to. Love this. That was a tough one.”

Pratt's wife shared several cute clips from the wedding trip, including one of the family crowding together for a photo. She joked in the caption, “How many adults does it take to get a photo with kids?”

How many adults does it take to get a photo with kids? ..

So how does Spencer Pratt know Brody Jenner? The pair actually goes way back, according to The Things, which says they are childhood friends. It was that friendship that got Brody onto “The Hills” in a “friend of” role. He first appeared on the show in season 2, which aired the same year “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” came out. Brody continued to make appearances through the show's six seasons, 

As of 2025, Pratt and Brody's friendship appears to still be going strong. In January, Brody told E! News, “I talk to Spencer almost every day.”

The rapper's potential witness list is 63 names deep, while UMG's lists just nine people. Check out the major names here.

As the evidence collection process gets underway in Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over the Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” Drake's legal team has included some high-profile names on a surprisingly long list of potential witnesses.


	Drake's so-called “initial disclosure” filing lists 63 people and entities whom he believes have evidence that could help his bombshell case against UMG. The document is dated June 2 but wasn't made public until Monday (July 14) as an attachment to Drake's motion to subpoena a man named Kojo Asamoah, whom the rapper claims was involved in paying bots to artificially inflate streaming numbers for “Not Like Us.”


	While inclusion on this list doesn't necessarily mean someone will be deposed or called to testify at trial, the individuals and companies named here could be asked to hand over documents to Drake's legal team as part of the evidence discovery process.  




			Trending on Billboard		







	The central allegation of the lawsuit is that UMG plotted to boost the popularity of Lamar's chart-topping Interscope Records track, in which he called Drake a “certified pedophile.” UMG, which also owns Drake's label Republic Records, vehemently denies the claims as “meritless.”


	To that end, Drake's initial disclosure names lots of UMG employees as potential witnesses in the case. But beyond seeking information from the people who handle music marketing on a day-to-day basis, the Canadian rapper seems to believe the conspiracy went all the way to the top of UMG, since he names CEO Sir Lucian Grainge as a source of information about “all causes of action” in the case.


	And Grainge isn't the only UMG bigwig on the list. Also named are Universal Music Publishing Group chief Jody Gerson, Interscope CEO John Janick and Republic co-founders Avery Lipman and Monte Lipman.


	Drake has not accused Lamar himself of defamation, and the Los Angeles rapper is notably absent from Drake's potential witness list. But he does name multiple high-profile people and businesses associated with Lamar, including former Top Dawg Entertainment president Dave Free and manager Anthony Saleh.


	As Drake's lawyers look for evidence of an alleged conspiracy to inflate the popularity of “Not Like Us,” the list states that streaming platforms like Amazon Music, Apple, Deezer, Soundcloud, Spotify and TIDAL should share details about UMG's “promotion and licensing of the defamatory material” and “use of covert tactics to promote the defamatory material.”


	Social media sites like TikTok, Twitch, YouTube and Instagram are also named as sources of this same information, as is Billboard.


	Drake's list targets live events as well. A number of the possible witnesses are entities involved in the production of Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime show performance, which, according to an updated version of the lawsuit, included a rendition of ”Not Like Us” out of an alleged desire to “assassinate the character of another artist.”


	Lawyers for the Canadian superstar say the NFL, Fox and Roc Nation could all have information about the “decision to play the defamatory material at the 2025 Super Bowl.” Drake is seeking similar details from the Recording Academy, asking what actions UMG took “to have the defamatory material featured at the 2025 Grammy Awards,” where “Not Like Us” swept up five trophies.


	UMG's initial disclosure is also attached as an exhibit to the Monday motion. The music giant's witness list, dated March 24, is significantly shorter than Drake's by a factor of seven. It names just nine potential witnesses, including Drake and various record executives.


	Unlike Drake, though, UMG's potential witness list also names Lamar himself.


	“Lamar is likely to have discoverable information concerning the creation of the recording, image and video, and the distribution and promotion of the recording and video,” write UMG's lawyers.  


	Reps for UMG and Drake's legal team both declined to comment on the witness lists on Monday.


	These revelations come amid a wait for a decision on UMG's motion to dismiss the case outright. Judge Jeannette A. Vargas in New York federal court held a hearing at the end of June on the question, and her upcoming ruling will determine whether or not Drake's claims are legally viable enough to move forward.

President Donald Trump has implored people to stop talking about Jeffrey Epstein. The internet isn't listening. 

Trump and many in his administration are now facing the wrath of the more conspiracy theory-minded people whom they counted among their most ardent supporters, sparked by the Department of Justice and Trump's own pleas for people to stop asking questions about Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose name has become synonymous with a broader distrust of the government and the media. 

“One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it's the 'HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World,” Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social. “Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

If anything, Trump's post only further invigorated discussion. Data from Google showed that searches for Epstein spiked after Trump's post. The fallout, which started in early June and ramped up over the weekend, has even hit some of Trump's most loyal spaces. Trump's Truth Social post has received more than 45,000 responses, far more than other recent posts, with many of the top comments expressing frustration with the president.

“This statement breaks my heart, Mr. President,” one commenter wrote.

“We want the ELITE PEDOS exposed!” another wrote. 

Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide, but conspiracy theories claiming that “Epstein didn't kill himself” began to spread almost immediately in the aftermath.

Trump has used conspiracy theories for political gain since before he ran for president, when he stoked false claims that Barack Obama's birth certificate was fake. Since then, he and his supporters have embraced or at least entertained a wide variety of outlandish claims, with many centering on child abuse. During his most recent presidential campaign, Trump said he would have “no problem” looking into an Epstein client list — a list that some people believe exists and that contains the names of powerful clients of Epstein's. 

Trump further leaned into the conspiracy mindset, appointing to senior positions people who have similarly used conspiracy theories to make broad accusations of corruption and abuse, most notably FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino.

“Nobody exploited those questions more than Donald Trump,” said Russell Muirhead, a professor at Dartmouth College who has written on the online intersection of conspiracy theories and politics. “And he did that because, as always, he wanted to paint government officials as liars, as self-serving, as liberal ideologues, as people who just deserve to be fired. Well, now government officials are people he appointed, and now he's saying, ‘Hey, there's nothing to see here.'”

Suspicions about the treatment of the Epstein case and his death have festered online across the political spectrum for years. The phrase “Epstein didn't kill himself,” a rebuttal to the official explanation of Epstein's death, has taken on a cultural meaning beyond the facts of the case, popping up in recent years everywhere from holiday decorations and stickers to internet memes.

Joseph Uscinski, a political science professor at the University of Miami who has written extensively on conspiracy theories, stressed that claims of shadowy groups of elites abusing children have been around for millennia, with the Epstein theories only a more recent and high-profile example.

“These ideas have been there,” he said. “We just weren't paying attention.”

Public interest in all things Epstein has remained high since last week, when Axios first reported that a two-page memo from the Justice Department featured a conclusion that an “exhaustive review” of materials related to Epstein found no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list'” or evidence for prosecuting other people connected to him. It also confirmed that Epstein had died by suicide. 

The memo inspired a large amount of backlash from Trump's supporters, which led to exhortations from Trump supporting Attorney General Pam Bondi and questioning the continued interest in Epstein — backlash that was only further exacerbated by Trump's Truth Social post.

Together, the combination has led to a sustained viral commotion over the last week that has been nearly inescapable online, from Reddit and YouTube to X and even Trump's own Truth Social.

Some of that unrest made its way offline. 

Over the weekend, at the conservative Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit, discussion of Epstein was unavoidable. Clips from that event, with people openly questioning the administration's credibility, also spread across social media. In a live taping of Steve Bannon's War Room podcast at the conference, one attendee told Trump's former campaign CEO and senior counselor that he believed “now Trump has become the deep state,” saying, “What is more deep state than covering up for pedophiles?”

There's not much the White House can do to quell the response. On Instagram, the White House restricted the ability to comment with GIFs on its official account and the @POTUS account, after users kept posting GIFs depicting Trump and Epstein together. 

Uscinski noted that Trump and officials in his administration did not do themselves any favors by fanning the flames around Epstein, particularly around Epstein's death, only to now be told to stop talking about it. But he added that Epstein theories broke beyond partisan lines in ways other conspiracy theories haven't.

“Their audience was listening to them, because they were telling them what they already believed,” Uscinski said of Trump administration officials. “Now that they're telling them something different, they don't want to go along with it.”

Having covered several administrations, I know from my own experience that there's one common complaint among White House reporters, no matter who is president: Lack of access. Why isn't he more available? Why won't he take our questions? 

That's not true of President Trump, though. He'll stop and take questions anywhere, anytime, on any topic. Well, almost any topic.

As we discovered last week, he'll take questions on any topic but one. 

“Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?” Trump exploded to a reporter who asked about Epstein at a July 8 Cabinet meeting. “This guy's been talked about for years. … And people are still talking about this guy, this creep?”  

Trump doesn't want to talk about Epstein for a couple of reasons. For one, he'd rather brag about his “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” that recently passed. For another, he'd rather forget about a convicted sexual predator whom, years earlier, he once described to New York Magazine as a “terrific guy” and “a lot of fun to be with.” 

But people are still talking about Epstein and, to Trump's dismay, will continue talking about him. Trump's problem is that it's not Democrats who are talking about Epstein but his MAGA base, who are angry at the way they believe Trump has sold out on the Epstein scandal. 

Trump begged MAGA supporters not to waste any more time on Epstein. He's even tried to blame it all on Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. But many of his MAGA supporters aren't buying it. Why? Because, ever since his apparent suicide in a federal prison cell in August 2019, MAGA commentators, with Trump's blessing, whipped up a conspiracy that the Biden Justice Department was lying about Epstein's suicide and covering up his client list to protect the “elites” who allegedly took part in Epstein's sexual depravity — and promised that, under a Trump Department of Justice, the sordid Epstein files would be released.

In a 2023 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, for example, MAGA activist Kash Patel accused Congress of blocking the release of Epstein's purported client list “because of who's on that list.” On his own podcast, Dan Bongino repeatedly questioned the handling of the Epstein investigation. “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?” he asked in 2023. 

But now Patel is director of the FBI. Bongino is his deputy director. Pam Bondi, another Epstein conspiratorialist, is attorney general. And, after Bondi told Fox News in February that the Epstein list was “sitting on my desk right now,” the Justice Department and FBI released a joint statement that contradicted everything Patel, Bongino and others had claimed for years: There is, in fact, no evidence that Epstein was murdered or kept a client list. 

That abrupt reversal, attempting to bury the whole Epstein matter, has inflamed the president's MAGA base against Bondi and Trump himself. In effect, they now accuse him of selling out and demand Bondi's resignation.

It was the main topic of conversation at last weekend's conservative Student Action Summit in Tampa. “I don't think they're telling us the truth about Epstein,” podcaster Brandon Tatum told the assembled crowd of 7,000 student activists. Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly asked the crowd a simple question: “Who do you believe? Bondi or Bongino?”

“Bongino!” they roared in response. 

Former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon accused Trump of not being as “transparent” as he promised and urged him to name a special counsel to take over the Epstein case. And, in a post, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn warned Trump: “Please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away.”  

The irony is that Bondi is probably right. Most likely, Epstein did commit suicide and did not keep a client list. But Trump and others did such a good job of selling MAGA leaders the lies about Epstein that it's now impossible to sell them the truth. This split in the MAGA world is entirely of Trump's own making.  

Starting with the Obama birther movement, Trump has long thrived on conspiracy theories. Now he is paying the price. If there's a lesson to be learned, it's this: Be careful of the monsters you create with your conspiracy theories, because they might come back to haunt you — which is exactly what Epstein is doing to Trump now.

Dan Rivera, a Connecticut paranormal investigator and one of the handlers of the famed Annabelle doll, died suddenly over the weekend, according to the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR).

Rivera, a Connecticut native, has cared for the doll made famous by "The Conjuring" movie series that was based on the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren.

      Attached are raw images from my iPhone. 1st photo is the original photo and the 2nd photo is zoomed in.
    


      Date/Time: 07/12/2025 at 9:31 PM EST. Location: Lansing, MI Duration: ~5 second - 10 seconds Shape: Teardrop / Bell-shaped / Unknown Number of objects: 1 Color: Dark silhouette Lighting Conditions: Sunset Sound: No sound Motion: Hovering or stationary, then sudden disappearance Weather: Clear and very little wind
    


      Facing North/NorthWest Approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon. Approximately 215 feet from me horizontally.
    


      I was outside around sunset when I noticed a large, dark object in the sky. It was bell-shaped or possibly teardrop-shaped, hovering silently above the horizon. The shape of the flying object was something I have personally never seen before. It looked solid and symmetrical, with no visible lights, no blinking indicators, and no sound — just a jet black silhouette against the colorful sky.
    


      At first, I thought it might be a cluster of balloons or maybe a drone, but it felt too big and still for either. The object remained completely motionless for about 5 seconds, and then — without warning — it disappeared. It didn't drift away, fly off, or shrink into the distance. It just vanished.
    


      I have accumulated hours of experience around drones from personally operating drones to watching and learning from others operating. This was something much larger than a standard drone that me, you, or the neighbor could get ahold of.
    


      There were no aircraft in the area, and the skies were otherwise clear. It wasn't windy, and I didn't hear any drones or buzzing sounds. It didn't behave like anything I've seen before, and I haven't been able to come up with a solid explanation since.
    


      I've honestly never really looked into UFO's or drones prior to last Saturday. I knew the pentagon released information confirming an influx of drones/unidentifiable flying objects from social media but now I can't stop looking into all of the facts that we as humans know - specifically information coming from renowned scientists, the US military, government, and prior individuals in authority. I don't know honestly, I'm at a lost and just looking for a solid explanation because the only thing I can land on is “UFO”. Open to hearing and discussing all options!

Listen to Story

The trailer of JP Thuminad's Kannada film 'Su From So' was released on July 15. 'Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana' fame Raj B Shetty is presenting the film under his banner Lighter Buddha Films. The film is a supernatural comedy drama set in a village backdrop, showcasing the vibrant life of the villagers—until one day, the devil arrives.

The trailer presents a third person's point of view into the lives of the villagers, with the voiceover of one of the protagonists, played by the director JP Thuminad, inviting viewers into his village. Set in the coastal Mangaluru–Udupi region of Karnataka, the trailer carries the essence of 'Kantara' and 'Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana', particularly through its dialect and depiction of local life.

 

While presenting the picturesque visuals of the location, delicious regional delicacies and the everyday life of the people, the trailer steadily introduces the audience to the lead characters—Ravi, Satish, Chandra and Ashoka, who is narrating the story. The peaceful lives of the villagers take a chilling but comedic turn when Sulochana from Someshwar (Su from Sa) starts haunting them. What follows is a hilarious chain of events that flips the entire village upside down.

'Su From So' stars Shaneel Gautham, JP Thuminad, Sandhya Arakere, Prakash K Thuminadu, Deepak Rai Panaje and Mime Ramdas, all of whom are familiar to audiences for their appearances in films helmed by Raj B Shetty, Rishab Shetty or Rakshit Shetty. The music for the film has been composed by Sumedh K, and one of its songs, 'Danks Anthem', has gone viral on social media. The film has been produced by Shashidhar Shetty Baroda, Ravi Rai Kalasa and Raj B Shetty.

'Su From So' is scheduled to release in theatres on July 25, 2025.- EndsPublished By: Sanjay Ponnappa CSPublished On: Jul 15, 2025ALSO READ |  KD teaser: Sanjay Dutt, Dhruva Sarja promise action-packed commercial entertainerMust Watch:

A psychic has detailed what it's like to 'die' after claiming to have experienced the feeling four times.

Amie Balesky, a spiritual medium with more than three million followers on TikTok, claims to have been 'helping spirits and people since 1995' and has taken to her social media account to share her latest near-death experience, which she says occurred due to a brain infection.

At the time she 'passed over', Balesky was on the operating table with doctors and nurses 'freaking out' trying to keep her alive during a dangerous procedure on her spine - which put her body into a state of shock.

The clairvoyant remembers the experience vividly: she was laid on her side watching the heart monitor when she noticed the numbers on the screen were plummeting, at which point her experiences change drastically.

Advert

"I stopped caring about what was going on around me and the feelings I had were more 'in'," she explained to her huge following on TikTok, noting that the room was getting quieter, despite all the commotion continuing.

"I could see it, I couldn't hear it anymore... silent. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, without any feeling, transition or anything like that, I notice that my vision or what I was seeing [was] beginning to drift to a different perspective - it was drifting up. I was looking down. All I could feel was love.

Advert

"So I only thought of two things. The first one was, 'Wow, that sucks that that's happening to my body' - I knew that it was my body. Second thing, I could feel how much love I had.

"All I wanted to do was tell my mom that I loved her. [It] was utter bliss. I could see everybody and [had] no pain. [It] was amazing."

The next thing she experienced was that she awoke two weeks later in a hospital room, and was told that she had died.

"So for me, the transition was beautiful. For me, it was peaceful - didn't even recognize that it was happening, and all my pain, anxiety, worries, all of that was gone simply in one breath," she continued.

Advert

The American, who goes by '@TheBalesky' on TikTok, explained that 'when you cross over' you're either met with one of your loved ones or a guy - although she didn't go into detail about whether that said person was Jesus, which many people have underwent similar experiences believe they have met.

Having had four near-death experiences, which she believes is the reason why her 'superpower' is so 'charged', she has urged people not to fear dying as it is as benign as stubbing your toe.

"Being worried about what it's going to feel like to pass is the equivalent of being worried about if you're going to stub your toe on the coffee table again - it's going to happen, it may hurt just a second, but as soon as it's there, it's gone," Balesky explained.

"You keep moving on because you are eternal - you are spirit."

University of California, Irvine (UCI) scientists conducting a fresh analysis of data from hundreds of exoplanets, including Earth-like planets that could potentially sustain extraterrestrial life, have discovered several cases where ‘interstellar contamination' caused by light from nearby stars resulted in previous models overestimating a planet's size.

Because a planet's size is a critical component in most models predicting potential exoplanet habitability, UCI doctoral student and study lead author Te Han believes the team's findings could eliminate several candidate exoplanets previously considered favorable places for astrobiologists to search for extraterrestrial life.

“We found that hundreds of exoplanets are larger than they appear, and that shifts our understanding of exoplanets on a large scale,” Han explained in a statement.

Since 1995, when scientists discovered the first planet outside of Earth's solar system, newer and more powerful observation tools have increased the confirmed list of exoplanets to over 5,000. Although researchers have employed several techniques to make those discoveries, most discoveries involve measuring the dip in a star's light as an exoplanet passes between it and Earth.

“We're basically measuring the shadow of the planet,” explained Paul Robertson, UC Irvine professor of astronomy and study co-author.

Dubbed the transit method, this technique allowed the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to discover more exoplanets than any other tool, including the Hubble Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. Along with determining an exoplanet's likely orbit, mass, and density, the TESS data helps scientists estimate its size.

Curious if models predicting the size of an exoplanet had factored in the interstellar contamination caused by light from nearby stars, Han's team combed through the TESS data archives. As expected, they found that light from a neighboring star can end up added to the light from a host star. If models don't take this excess light into account, they may assume a planet is smaller than it is, since a smaller planet would block less of its host planet's light during transit.

Having confirmed the interstellar contamination, Han and colleagues reexamined hundreds of previous TESS exoplanet discoveries. First, they categorized the studies based on the method of exoplanet radius measurement employed by the researchers. Han said this data allowed the UCI team to estimate how much the exoplanet's size had been biased due to interstellar contamination. Next, the team compared the data with observations gathered by the GAIA satellite mission, which further supported the interstellar contamination findings.

“TESS data are contaminated, which Te's custom model corrects better than anyone else in the field,” Robertson explained.

In their study, Han, Robertson, and colleagues explain how correcting for this interstellar contamination has led to significant changes in the characteristics of the exoplanets they studied. Robertson said that perhaps the study's most significant discovery, especially for researchers searching for extraterrestrial life, is that exoplanet candidates that might be home to ET “may systematically be larger than we initially thought.”

“It raises the question: Just how common are Earth-sized planets?” Robertson asks.

One example cited by Han was the discovery of single-planet systems by TESS. According to the researcher, only three such TESS discoveries were thought to have compositions similar to Earth. After correcting for interstellar contamination, “all of them are actually bigger than we thought.”

In the study's conclusion, the research team explains how their interstellar contamination findings affect the search for Extraterrestrial life. For example, although some scientists have begun to rethink what form life outside Earth might take, most models still favor looking for places that can support liquid water, are rocky like Earth, and have a relatively similar size. If Han's new model is correct and many planets we initially thought were Earth-like are much larger, they may not be rocky at all. Instead, they may be theoretical ‘water worlds' covered by one giant ocean. They may also be gaseous planets like Neptune and Uranus.

“This has important implications for our understanding of exoplanets, including, among other things, prioritization for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, and the controversial existence of a galactic population of water worlds,” Roberston explained.

Hoping to add to the potentially habitable exoplanet list instead of taking away from it, Han and his team plan to reexamine TESS data for candidates that were previously dismissed but now may be viable candidates for extraterrestrial life due to the inclusion of interstellar contamination in their size and composition estimates. The team also wants to let other exoplanet researchers know about the interstellar contamination phenomenon so they can correct for it in their transit models.

The visit of a doll steeped in paranormal legend to Gettysburg ended in tragedy this weekend with the sudden passing of one of the national tour's lead organizers, according to the New England Society for Psychic Research, the organization behind the tour.

Dan Rivera, 54, the lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research and a U.S. Army veteran, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, July 13, 2025, during his visit to Gettysburg, the society announced on Monday evening.

Rivera was among the leading faces of the viral "Devils on the Run Tour," in which Rivera and other members of the New England Society for Psychic Research had brought the allegedly haunted doll, Annabelle, across the country to various sites.

Adams County dispatch scanner archives show that firefighters and medical personnel had been called to a hotel in Gettysburg on Sunday evening for a report of CPR in progress on a male patient of Rivera's age.

The Gettysburg leg of the tour, which was hosted by Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours at the Soldiers National Orphanage, completely sold out, organizers said, selling over 1,260 tickets across three days on the weekend of Friday, July 11, 2025, with the visit concluding on Sunday afternoon.

Rivera had helped bring the tour to international attention through his public outreach, including numerous viral TikTok videos that Rivera produced with paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell that racked up millions of views as the doll was taken across the country.

The tour had garnered extensive publicity in recent months, even sparking outrage in several locations as many took to social media over superstitions regarding the doll's storied past.

In the hours that followed the announcement of Rivera's death on Monday evening, an outpouring of tributes and memorials to Rivera began to pop up across the paranormal community, remembering Rivera for his passion for sharing the paranormal and as a caring husband, father and friend.

On Saturday, the Evening Sun was in attendance at the Gettysburg event as Rivera led one of the sold-out tours for patrons to view the Annabelle doll.

Prior to leading the group into the room to view the doll, Rivera was full of charisma as he joked with visitors about the viral fame of the tour and emphasized his focus on making a positive experience for their visit.

"I want you guys to have a good time," he told the group gathered at the orphanage.

Rivera, who was mentored by famous paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren, told those gathered at the event about the steps he had taken to "protect them" from the doll, including the case housing the doll that Rivera had built himself.

That case, Rivera told the group, he built with three crosses, representing the holy trinity, and is stained in a finish that contained holy water.

In his remarks, Rivera joked that "we did not burn down that plantation," and "we did not free those prisoners," referencing some of the viral instances that social media had attempted to tie to the doll's journey.

Later in the tour, Rivera added that Annabelle had not caused a 911 outage that sent wireless emergency alerts blaring across cellphones Pennsylvania, including inside of the first showings of the doll a day prior.

Speaking of his late mentor, Rivera shared with the audience that her guidance for protecting oneself from "evil spirits" entailed almost a form of meditation.

"What Lorraine would say to protect yourself," said Rivera, "is to close your eyes and envision yourself in a halo of white light."

Biographies for Rivera described an "insatiable curiosity" about the paranormal from a young age that led to Rivera founding his own paranormal investigation group after his service in the U.S. Army.

That curiosity also led Rivera to attend lectures from Lorraine Warren, where biographies said Warren had taken Rivera under her wing and mentored him in the last years of her life, eventually leading to his appointment as the lead investigator for NESPR in 2011.

NESPR was founded in 1952 by Ed and Lorraine Warren, who were known for their paranormal investigations of "The Amityville Horror" house on Long Island, the "Enfield Poltergeist," and the Annabelle doll.

The legend of Annabelle, and the stories of the Warrens, went on to inspire a lucrative film series, "The Conjuring," which became the highest-grossing horror series worldwide as of 2023, cementing the Warrens', and Annabelle's, place in pop culture history.

After Ed Warren's passing in 2006, then Lorraine's passing in 2019, NESPR and the Warrens' occult museum collection in Connecticut has been maintained by their daughter, Judy Spera, and their son-in-law, Tony Spera.

While the museum closed to the public in 2019 over zoning issues, the items within the Warrens' museums have in recent years traveled around the country to be displayed.

In addition to his work with NESPR, Rivera had been featured as a paranormal investigator on television, such as the Travel Channel's "Most Haunted Places," as well as serving as a producer for paranormal television series such as Netflix's "28 Days Haunted."

In a tribute to Rivera by Buell, Buell shared that Rivera had cared extensively for Lorraine near the end of her life.

"He devoted his time, passionately, to keeping Ed and Lorraine's legacy alive," Buell wrote in the post.

Buell, who worked with Rivera on the tour, noted Rivera's success in helping continue the Warrens' story in recent years through organizing the paranormal convention ParaCon, which visited Gettysburg in 2024, as well as the Annabelle tour, which Buell said had "introduced a whole new generation to Ed and Lorraine Warren's legacy."

Rivera's work involving the paranormal extended beyond publicity, according to the post, including what Buell said was private work that Rivera and NESPR undertook to assist families that were allegedly haunted.

"Just as Ed and Lorraine did," Buell noted.

The news of Rivera's passing quickly spread among those involved in the tour and through social media on Monday night.

In the announcement by NESPR, fellow investigator Chris Gilloren, who was among those at the Gettysburg event, recalled Rivera's passion and enjoyment of sharing his love for the paranormal with others.

"Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal," Gilloren wrote. "His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him."

"We are heartbroken and still processing this loss," Gilloren said in the statement from himself, fellow NESPR investigator Wade Kirby, and Spera.

"Thank you for your support and kind thoughts during this difficult time."

Mary Jo Chudley, of Penn Paranormal in Bucks County, had been among those who participated in the event on Saturday, and shared a tribute to the group's extensive social media following.

"A true legend was lost, both in life and in the paranormal," Chudley wrote. "He was one of the kindest, most genuine and funniest guys I've ever known."

On Buell's post, hundreds of comments and thousands of reactions were shared within just two hours of the post being made, many of which were additional tributes to Rivera.

Many of those commenters spoke highly of their own interactions with Rivera at various paranormal events, recalling his enjoyment of sharing his love for the paranormal with others.

As the news circulated around various paranormal communities, some resurfaced a 2020 post from Rivera that was made in tribute to his own personal mentor, Lorraine, on the anniversary of her passing.

"Does life really end?" Rivera began the 2020 post which included a photograph of the joint grave of the two famous investigators, "I've asked myself that question today."

"My answer was, in life, we leave a piece of ourselves with loved ones and friends on our journey through life until there are no more pieces to give away. You would think that is the end, but, when you look back at all the pieces you gave away, those pieces will always be remembered."

"So I say I will never die," Rivera wrote. "My journey has only begun."

Gabe Torres lining up a shot on the set of the movie "Brake" in 2010. 

Reporting intern





A 1986 mystery by a Cayuga County native returned to the big screen last weekend before a crowd on the shores of Cayuga Lake.

“The Legend of Firefly Marsh,” directed by Gabe Torres, of Aurora, tells the story of a legendary lake monster. Many such stories have emerged from his hometown since the 1800s, which is why the short film was selected to lead off the 51st annual AuroraFest village celebration, whose theme was "mystical lake creatures." 

Shot both locally and in California, the film features many local names and settings. Torres, who now lives in Los Angeles, joined the screening to answer questions via Zoom. 

While local and national audiences have been familiar with the mystery films of Torres for decades, in recent years his work has been seen in much greater numbers thanks to "Unsolved Mysteries" on Netflix. After directing episodes of the documentary series in the early 2000s, Torres returned for the popular reboot, which has reached No. 1 on the streamer's most-watched list.

In the wake of that success, and his screening of "Firefly Marsh" in Aurora, The Citizen caught up with Torres to talk more about his past, present and future projects. 

A depiction of the Mothman —  a cryptid that some believe lives in Point Pleasant, West Virginia —  on the set of Gabe Torres' "Unsolved Mysteries."

When The Citizen spoke to Torres at around 7:30 a.m. Pacific time, he was already at work.

The Aurora native was brokering phone and video calls for his latest project, a documentary drama about different factions hunting for the fabled cryptid Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. 

It's familiar territory after "Unsolved Mysteries," for which Torres directed five episodes in 2022 and 2024.

“One day they called and asked if I wanted to do it again,” he told The Citizen. “They said, 'We're bringing it to a new generation, and upping the production value.'” 

Torres' episodes cover some well-known topics, such as Bigfoot's West Virginian cousin, the Mothman, and the discovery of what some believe to be UFO debris in Roswell, New Mexico. 

However, much to Torres' pleasure, he got to cover lesser-known stories as well.

“The dream of it is to find the story that has not been told,” Torres said. 

One new episode that stuck out to Torres was “The Body in the Basement.” 

It covers the story of a bloody, unsolved murder in Calgary — a true story that Torres, holding his tongue to prevent spoilers, said is unraveled in reverse order. 

Another, “Something in the Sky,” chronicles the aftermath of mass UFO sightings over Lake Michigan in the 1990s. 

To Torres, that pair of episodes was a welcome break from business as usual in modern television, reminding him of when he was first starting decades ago.





“In the Netflix era, the streaming execs want us to explore stories that would drive their algorithms more,” he said, noting frequent pitches from them about Jack the Ripper, Roswell and the Mothman.

"In the old days, we would just pick the best mystery.” 

Still, the streamer decided not to renew the series after its fifth volume came out in October 2024. It's now being shopped to other platforms. 

Torres said he's appreciative the series gave him the chance to direct mysteries again, and hopes it finds a home somewhere else. 

“To bring something to an audience where no one knows what happens — that's much more gratifying, and much more fun,” he said.

While Torres likes making documentaries, he called it his “day job.” 

His true passion, he said, is making films — and his voice brightened as he started talking about two he is currently working on.

He just finished the script for one of them, a horror film called “Dragon Fall,” and is now looking for a teenage lead actor who can help sell it. 

The other, “Nothing to Lose,” has already been picked up by production company Dolphin Entertainment and is set to begin shooting in Nashville after it casts its lead actors. 

Torres' passion for filmmaking started young, at age 12. After watching films like “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” he became fascinated with how they looked. 

“It was really films like that had a lot of action and visual elements that would get me asking, ‘How did they do that?' and, ‘How did they make it look like that?'” he said. 

He lucked into finding a Kodak Super 8 film camera at his neighbor's house and set out making disaster shorts, like sinking ships and collapsing dams. 

“It wasn't until my senior year that I focused on stories rather than special effects,” Torres said, “and that's where my passion lies now.” 

As Torres continues to add new projects and credits to his resume, people still contact him about "Firefly Marsh" as well.

Just last month, he said, a fan from the United Kingdom who used to watch it on the Disney Channel reached out in hopes of getting a copy, which Torres provided.

“There's all these kids that grew up in the '90s that loved everything,” he said. “It's always great to have your work, that you pour so much into, get recognized.”

A lot has changed in Hollywood since Torres got his start, like the meteoric rise of streaming. But he still clings to old-school habits — all his scripts find life on yellow legal pads, and physical copies of films and vinyl soundtracks still line his shelves. He'll also never stop tapping into the childhood magic that made films so special for him growing up.

“I think 'Firefly Marsh' is a throwback to the magic of childhood, when you believe in myths and in monsters,” he said. “Everything is possible, if you believe.”

Scientists are looking down at the alien-looking creatures on the bottom of Earth's deep sea to figure out what kind of extraterrestrial life may exist up in space.

Extraterrestrial life is most likely to be microbial, contrary to popular culture's depiction of little grey beings with big heads and black eyes. There are some candidate moons and planets within our own solar system which could harbour such life.

The discovery of life evolving somewhere else would be one of the greatest in the history of science, answering the age-old question: are we alone?

Finding extraterrestrial life within our own solar system would suggest that, not only are we not alone, but the universe is likely to be teeming with inhabited worlds.

One candidate for extraterrestrial life is Europa, Jupiter's fourth largest moon.

Europa has a surface of solid ice. But it is one of at least 3 Jovian moons which astronomers believe could have salty oceans of liquid water beneath its icy exterior. NASA observations suggest that Europa's icy crust could be 15–25km thick. The liquid ocean beneath could be up to 150km deep.

One more ingredient would make Europa habitable: if the moon has a hot, molten core which supplies the ocean floor with heat and crucial minerals.

“We think, based on our own planet, that Europa may have conditions that can support life,” says James Holden, a microbiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US.

Holden is leading an expedition, not to outer space, but to a region which is even less understood: Earth's deep ocean floor. He believes that the hydrothermal vents thousands of metres beneath the surface are prime sites to study what life on other worlds might be like.

“I've been looking at deep-sea volcanoes since 1988,” he says. “To get our microbes from them, we use submarines – sometimes human-occupied, sometimes robotic – to dive a mile below the surface and bring the samples ashore and back into my lab.”

NASA has awarded Holden's team nearly $1 million (US$621,000) to study Earth's deep-sea microbes over 3 years, providing insights into possible life on Europa including what signs to look for to confirm whether Jupiter's moon also supports life.

“Because Europa's conditions might be similar to the conditions these microbes come from, we think that Europan life, if it exists, should look something like our own hydrothermal microbes,” Holden explains.

“We have long had a basic interest in knowing if there is life beyond our planet and how that life would function. It's exciting to think that the answer to the secret might be here on our own planet.”

On Earth, deep-sea microbes produce energy by breaking down hydrogen from the hydrothermal vents using enzymes called hydrogenases. Different types of hydrogenases work in different ways, performing a variety of functions in different cells.

Holden's team will use their understanding of Earth's deep-sea microbes to try and understand how microbes on a world with different chemistry would live.

“We need to figure out the different chemical processes that Europan microbial life might be using in order to create energy,” Holden says. “Different chemistries could create very different kinds of microbes.”

NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft launched in October 2024 and is on a 5-year mission to provide new observations of Jupiter's moon which could, along with insights from Holden's Earth-based studies, provide evidence that there is life on Europa.
