                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newly uncovered metadata reveals that nearly three minutes of footage were cut from what the US Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation described as “full raw” surveillance video from the only functioning camera near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead. The video was released last week as part of the Trump administration's commitment to fully investigate Epstein's 2019 death but instead has raised new questions about how the footage was edited and assembled. WIRED previously reported that the video had been stitched together in Adobe Premiere Pro from two video files, contradicting the Justice Department's claim that it was “raw” footage. Now, further analysis shows that one of the source clips was approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds longer than the segment included in the final video, indicating that footage appears to have been trimmed before release. The nearly three-minute discrepancy may be related to the widely reported one-minute gap—between 11:58:58 pm and 12:00:00 am—that attorney general Pam Bondi has attributed to a nightly system reset. The footage was released at a moment of political tension. But last week, the DOJ and FBI issued a memo stating that no “incriminating ‘client list'” exists and reaffirmed the government's long-standing conclusion that Epstein—whom the US government accused of committing conspiracy to sex traffic minors and sex trafficking minors—died by suicide. That announcement triggered immediate backlash from pro-Trump influencers and media figures, who essentially accused the administration of a cover-up. In response to detailed questions about how the video was assembled, WIRED sent a request for comment to the Department of Justice at 7:40 am on Tuesday morning. On Friday, WIRED published an analysis of metadata embedded in the video, confirmed by independent video forensics experts, which indicates that the file was assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ's website, where it was presented as “raw” footage. WIRED's initial analysis found that those saves took place over a 23-minute span; however, further analysis of additional metadata shows the file was actually edited and saved several times over a period of more than three and a half hours on May 23, 2025. Both analyses found that the two clips, labeled “2025-05-22 16-35-21.mp4” and “2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4,” were stitched together. WIRED reviewed its findings with two independent video forensics experts, each with over 15 years of experience in Premiere and video production, who confirmed that the edit occurred just before the missing minute mark and that approximately three minutes of footage were cut from the original clip. Both versions include internal comment markers, annotations typically used in editing software to flag moments of interest. The enhanced version, which the FBI referred to as Video 2, contains 15 such markers that apparently correspond to visible movement near “46 door” at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). This door is near the cell block where Epstein was being held while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. These markers appear to have been left by analysts during their review, but they do not include the original comment text. Both the 2023 OIG report and the DOJ-FBI memo published last week state that anyone entering or attempting to access the tier containing Epstein's cell from the SHU common area on August 9 or 10, 2019, would have been visible on that camera. However, Epstein's cell door itself was not within the camera's field of view. Amid backlash from supporters and critics alike, President Donald Trump defended Bondi on Saturday, saying she was doing a “fantastic job.” “What's going on with my ‘boys' and, in some cases, ‘gals?' They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palmer Luckey, cofounder of the weapons manufacturer Anduril, along with firms connected to Palantir cofounders Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, are investing in a new bank that is aiming to fill a gap left by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse two years ago. The venture is expected to be backed by upwards of $250 million in funding from Luckey, Lonsdale's venture firm 8VC, Thiel's Founders Fund, crypto-focused VC Haun Ventures, and several angel investors whose identities are not yet publicly known. Like Anduril and Palantir, Erebor Bank is named after a term coined by J.R.R. The bank's organizers and backers have remained tight-lipped about their vision. But their national bank charter application filed in June with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as well as interviews with more than a dozen industry sources, suggest the organizers are leveraging current regulatory openness in banking, as well as their political power, to build a crypto-focused Silicon Valley Bank successor made in their image. The leadership team named in Erebor's application includes Michael Hagedorn, an experienced bank executive who will serve as Erebor's president; Trevor Capozza, head of operations at Palmer Luckey's family office; and co-CEOs Owen Rapaport, cofounder of crypto compliance platform Aer Compliance, and Jacob Hirshman, who has served in regulatory and advisory roles at the stablecoin provider Circle. Erin Gleason, chief communications officer of Founders Fund, told WIRED that Thiel was “not involved” in the deal and that Founders Fund invested $1 million into Erebor. Luckey and Lonsdale are not named in the nonconfidential sections of Erebor's filings; the application notes that major shareholders will not be involved in day-to-day operations. Luckey, 8VC, Erebor's organizers, and their attorney, Adam Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment. Erebor's intended client base is similar to that of Silicon Valley Bank, which served as the go-to business-banking partner for the San Francisco Bay Area tech industry and its affiliates. (SVB famously collapsed in March 2023 after economic volatility and risky liquidity practices led to a run on the bank. First Citizens Bank purchased SVB after the collapse; it now operates as a subsidiary.) It also plans to assist foreign banks with some dollar-based activities. Erebor claims its target business clients are currently “not well served by either traditional or disruptive financial institutions, in particular with respect to insufficient access to credit” and says it will maintain a conservative balance sheet to account for the risks of “having a loan portfolio focused on frontier industries.” Erebor also has crypto aspirations, including becoming “the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions” and facilitating “broader acceptance of stablecoins.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a currency or traditionally less-volatile commodity; they are often backed by cash or instruments like treasury bills with the aim of maintaining a consistent value. The bank additionally says it would accept cryptocurrencies as collateral for some loans. (An OCC spokesperson said the agency "does not comment on pending licensing applications or specific financial institutions" in response to a request for comment by WIRED.) In March, for example, Rodney Hood, then-acting head of the OCC, overturned a Biden-era directive that had compelled banks to prove that they had “controls in place to conduct [stablecoin] activity in a safe and sound manner” before using stablecoin products and services. The Trump family, meanwhile, launched its own Trump-branded stablecoin earlier this year. Stablecoin advocates say the technology can be used to make real-time, cross-border payments more affordable. Migrating to a digital system that has experienced crashes and is weakly regulated also raises fears of contagion, which could elevate risk and erode trust in financial systems. Crypto companies Circle, Ripple, BitGo, and a subsidiary of Protego are all applying for banking charters; Coinbase is “actively considering” a charter application; and payments firm Wise has also filed with the OCC. If approved by the OCC and other regulators, Erebor can accept deposits, make loans, and be eligible for Federal Reserve payment systems as well as FDIC insurance. Some new charter applications reflect “the adoption of ‘pay to play' in a whole lot of areas that traditionally did not work that way,” says Todd Baker, a financial services executive and senior fellow at Columbia Business School and Columbia Law School. That the cofounders of a weapons manufacturer and surveillance behemoth have set their sights on banking may raise some eyebrows. There are some statutes, such as the Bank Holding Company Act and Change of Bank Control Act, that aim to prevent commercial ventures and their owners from engaging in banking activities or exerting control over banks (with a few exceptions). At the same time, as an early adopter of blockchain-based cross-border payments technologies for defense and law-enforcement purposes, such as for paying assets overseas, Erebor may be considered useful by the US government as a clearing house for blockchain-based government activities, according to Kevin Lehtiniitty, an executive in stablecoin-based payments infrastructure who has counted US government agencies as clients. "What I imagine is going on here is that should this become a new chartered bank … the bank would be providing this ‘cash in, obfuscated crypto out' type of a product that would allow these agencies to be able to make payments,” he says. In Anduril's case, Palmer Luckey and his cofounders started by targeting the US government's border-security technologies, identifying them as a “fringe” part of the defense market. They offered an “imperfect but good enough technological solution and then [rode] the wave of improvement in that technology,” McDonald tells WIRED. Stephen Marcus, cofounder and general partner of Riot Ventures, which invests in some of the industries Erebor intends to serve, says Erebor will soon have to speak publicly about its products and determine how it will “communicate the stability” to potential business clients. Granted, that assumes Erebor gets that far; for all the deregulation making charter approvals speedier and more likely, regulators may see Erebor's application as too unprecedented or systemically risky. According to Evey Guo, principal at lobbying firm and consulting group FS Vector (founded by the former chief compliance officer and general counsel of Circle), Erebor's “novel elements” may elicit “additional regulatory scrutiny and require particularly robust controls.” Another banking industry specialist said Erebor's “monocrop” client profile could also cause concern, as a lack of client diversity partially contributed to the bank collapses of 2023. Additionally, Baker, the senior fellow at Columbia, contends Erebor's conservative approach to lending relative to its balance sheet may impose hurdles, as regulators have rejected previous banking proposals that shied away from lending.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As publishers fret about decreased traffic from Google, the search giant has begun rolling out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google's search app on iOS and Android. Now, instead of seeing a headline from a major publication, users will see multiple news publishers' logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources. The app warns that these summaries are generated with AI, “which can make mistakes.” Though not flagged as powered by AI, some stories will include a set of bullet points below the headline or will be grouped with similar news. Outside of Google, this same trend is seen across other AI apps, like ChatGPT or Perplexity. Recently, Google tried to appease publishers with the launch of Offerwall, a feature that allows publishers to generate revenue beyond the more traffic-dependent options, like ads. With Offerwall, publishers who use Google Ad Manager can try out different methods to provide access to their content, like micropayments or having users take surveys, sign up for newsletters, watch ads, and more. But for many publishers, these tools are coming too late, as traffic is already in a steep decline. A story by The Economist this week noted that worldwide search traffic fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, citing data from market intelligence company Similarweb. Earlier data from the firm also found that the number of news searches on the web that result in no click-throughs to news websites had grown from 56% in May 2024, when AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% as of May 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok have exploded in popularity as AI becomes mainstream. These tools don't have the ability to make new scientific discoveries on their own, but billionaires are convinced that AI is on the cusp of doing just that. And the latest episode of the All-In podcast helps explain why these guys think AI is extremely close to revolutionizing scientific knowledge. When the topic turned to AI, Kalanick discussed how he uses xAI's Grok, which went haywire last week, praising Adolf Hitler and advocating for a second Holocaust against Jews. “I'll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I'll start to get to the edge of what's known in quantum physics and then I'm doing the equivalent of vibe coding, except it's vibe physics,” Kalanick explained. And I've gotten pretty damn close to some interesting breakthroughs just doing that.” The guys on the podcast only briefly addressed Grok's failures without getting into specifics about the MechaHitler debacle, and none of that stopped Kalanick from talking like Grok was this revolutionary tool that was so close to making scientific discoveries in revolutionary ways. I'm just like, dude, if I'm doing this and I'm super amateur hour physics enthusiast, like what about all those PhD students and postdocs that are super legit using this tool?” Kalanick said. Now with Grok 4, like, there's a lot of mistakes I was seeing Grok make that then I would correct, and we would talk about it. Because anyone who actually understands large language models knows that it can't achieve new ways of thinking. It's just putting together words in the most statistically likely way, forming connections that may sound like a well-thought-out argument but are actually not a form of true “intelligence” as humans would define it. Kalanick said that he hasn't used Grok 4 because he was having technical difficulties accessing it, suggesting that perhaps a later version of Grok might be capable of such a thing. But he admitted the AI couldn't yet come up with new discoveries. “No, it cannot come up with the new idea. These things are so wedded to what is known. And they're so like, even when I come up with a new idea, I have to really, it's like pulling a donkey. Palihapitiya went a step further than Kalanick, insisting that synthetic data could train new AI models. “When these models are fully divorced from having to learn on the known world and instead can just learn synthetically, then everything gets flipped upside down to what is the best hypothesis you have or what is the best question? Musk revealed a similar line of thinking recently when he suggested “general artificial intelligence” was close because he had asked Grok “about materials science that are not in any books or on the Internet.” The idea, of course, is that Musk had hit the limits of known science rather than the limit of his scientific understanding. The billionaire really seems convinced that Grok was working on something new. That was how I felt when asking Grok 4 questions about materials science that are not in any books or on the Internet https://t.co/2wEP3mtD2j These guys are hyping up the idea of general artificial intelligence (AGI), which doesn't even have an exact definition. But it's far from the only term getting tossed around right now. AI folks also drop words like “superintelligence” without defining what that means, but it sure keeps the investors intrigued. These AI chatbots are pulling off a magic trick. They can often seem like they're “thinking” or applying rational thought to a given answer, but they work by spitting out the word that's most likely to be next in a sentence, not by actually applying critical reasoning. Apple has gotten a lot of shit for not committing to AI in a more forceful way, something the All-In guys talked about, but the company understands perhaps better than most that there are limitations to this tech. In fact, Apple released a paper last month that shows how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) struggle, facing “a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities.” Apple's paper won't dampen the hype, of course. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Monday that his company was building enormous new data centers to work on superintelligence. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. Grok's new “Companions” feature taps into waifu culture, emotional dependency, and viral fandom. The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is the kind of companion that doesn't want to do anything but watch movies and cuddle. From Hitler apologist to anime waifu: Musk's xAI debuts "Companions" in a whiplash-inducing pivot. The ChatGPT maker was about to release its first major open-weight model, but a last-minute discovery has put the project on ice, fueling speculation about what went wrong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's reportedly a potential new player in AR glasses, and you'll never guess who it is. No, not Tinder; get your mind out of the gutter. I'm talking about TikTok, or more specifically, ByteDance, which owns TikTok and also, according to The Information, which cites sources within the company, has aspirations of entering the burgeoning world of XR hardware. ByteDance's entrant, according to the report, is a pair of goggle-like AR glasses that sit somewhere in between Meta's Quest and Apple's Vision Pro, and I have to say… they sound kind of cool? According to The Information, the AR goggles, codenamed Phoenix, will have digital passthrough, which is to say, they'll have XR similar to what you might see on a Quest 3, and they'll weigh just 100 grams. That smaller form factor will definitely come with some limitations, though. Reducing the weight is all well and good, but it's still hard to miniaturize some of the high-end tech found in headsets like Vision Pro—I can't say for sure, but I wouldn't expect any high-res micro-OLED display here. That being said, the report says that Phoenix will still borrow some of the capabilities from more premium headsets like the Vision Pro, including a UI that's centered around hand and eye-tracking instead of controllers, just like Apple's visionOS that powers the Vision Pro. While The Information doesn't say anything about price, I'm going to assume that Phoenix, if it ever sees the light of day, will be much cheaper than the Vision Pro, though that's not saying much since Apple's only headset—sorry, “spatial computer”—is still a conversation-ending $3,500. If the report is correct, what we're looking at here is a lightweight AR headset that, yes, may be a little bit dumber than the rest of the pack, but is also a lot more accessible both weight-wise and monetarily. That's basically Meta's playbook with the Quest 3S, which costs just $299 and still does pretty much all of the things you'd want an XR headset to do, just not at a fancy-schmancy Vision Pro level. That lower capability but accessible price and weight strategy has been a fruitful one for Meta. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, for example, are shells of what competitors like Xreal are putting out—they don't even have displays in them—but they've resonated with people who want something affordable, lightweight, and with just enough features to make the price feel worthwhile. XR is still a nascent field at the end of the day, so it's too early to prognosticate on whether ByteDance's Phoenix glasses will be any good or anywhere close to successful. As a reality check, ByteDance notably owns the company Pico, which makes VR hardware that has yet to really challenge Meta's Quest dominance. That being said, this is a new product, and ByteDance may nail the strategy with Phoenix. Plus, with TikTok-level resources, it's hard to count anyone out.

Firmware security research company Binarly has discovered four new vulnerabilities affecting the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) on multiple Gigabyte motherboards. The cause of concern is said to lie within the System Management Mode (SMM), a high-privilege operating mode on x86 processors meant for low-level system management tasks. SMM grants UEFI access to the system hardware, where all the code is executed in a secure memory area called System Management RAM (SMRAM). This memory can only be accessed using Special System Management Interrupt (SMI) handlers, which rely on specific communication buffers to process data. However, in case these handlers do not validate the data, it can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code before the operating system is loaded. Unchecked RBX register enables arbitrary SMRAM writes via OcHeader/OcData pointers Unvalidated function pointers allow attacker control over flash operations As per CERT's report, an attacker with administrative access could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code in SMM and bypass key UEFI protections, including Secure Boot. Since SMM operates below the OS kernel, it can be hard to spot or disable the vulnerability using traditional security tools. Gigabyte is already rolling out firmware updates for many of the affected models. As per the latest security advisory, the company has shared a list of impacted products and corresponding BIOS versions, which includes a large number of Gigabyte motherboard models across the Intel 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 series platforms. Binarly has confirmed to Bleeping Computers that over a hundred product lines are potentially at risk, including various revisions and region-specific models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joseph Rutakanga spent eight years looking for tools to help companies gather consumer insight data. Now his startup, called Rwazi, has raised a $12 million Series A led by Bonfire Ventures to help companies with market intelligence and consumer insights. But when it came to international markets, including economic giants like India, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Turkey, and China, there was nothing usable,” he told TechCrunch. “No real picture on consumption, what consumers wanted, or how their behavior was shifting.” At first, he thought to solve the issue by purchasing statistics from government trade agencies. But eventually, he found that data to be outdated, fragmented, or sometimes simply nonexistent. It was what we now call zero-party data; consumption data that's voluntarily shared by the consumer, within their own routines, captured using advanced validation and verification systems, across any location, in real time,” Rutakangwa said. The pair via their startup, ended up building an AI-powered intelligence software system that lets businesses have real-time visibility into their consumer markets. It helps predict consumer behavior and identify important areas to pay attention to, which, in turn, can help reduce the cost of customer acquisition and boost customer loyalty. The company previously raised a $4 million seed round in 2022, also led by Bonfire Ventures. Rutakangwa described the fundraising process this time around as “selective,” saying he and Sewankambo focused on “finding the right partners, those who deeply understood the problem.” Other investors in this round include Santa Barbara Ventures, Newfund, and Alumni Ventures. It currently pulls data from 190 countries, with customers primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Rwazi does have competition,n including from legacy consumer insights companies GFK and Ipsos. But Rutakangwa said Rwazi is different from its competitors because it doesn't rely on modeled or inferred data. Instead, its own infrastructure allows for insight and execution; knowing what to do and what to do about it, he continued. “Winning today means anticipating shifts, seeing around corners, and making confident moves before the competition even senses a change,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a very busy week for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. After meeting with President Donald Trump and senior officials in Beijing in recent days, Huang has secured a major victory for his AI-chip empire. On Monday, Nvidia announced that the U.S. government will allow it to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The H20 chip is a dialed-down version of Nvidia's powerhouse H100 semiconductor, built specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The restrictions are also part of a broader effort to maintain America's edge in AI. Back in April, those curbs tightened even more. But now, it appears all but certain that Huang has managed to convince Trump that selling to China is actually a win for America. According to the company, during Huang's meeting with Trump and other U.S. policymakers, he reaffirmed “NVIDIA's support for the Administration's effort to create jobs, strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and onshore manufacturing, and ensure that America leads in AI worldwide.” Huang has also made the case that if the future is AI, it's better that it runs on American hardware. “General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation,” Huang told reporters in D.C. “We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.” This news comes just days after Nvidia made history, becoming the first company ever to reach a $4 trillion market cap. Founded in 1993, Nvidia's chips were mostly known for decades for their use in gaming and computer graphics; however, they have now become the backbone in some major tech advances including AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. His fortune has already surpassed that of old-school business titan Warren Buffett and is just $1 billion shy of catching up to internet pioneer Sergey Brin. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. It's his second shot at a streaming comeback.

Independent security journalist Brian Krebs reports that Marko Elez, a special government employee who in recent months has worked on sensitive systems at the U.S. Treasury, the Social Security Administration, and Homeland Security, recently published code to his GitHub containing the private key. The key allowed access to dozens of models developed by xAI, including Grok. Philippe Caturegli, founder of consultancy firm Seralys, alerted Elez to the leak earlier this week. “If a developer can't keep an API key private, it raises questions about how they're handling far more sensitive government information behind closed doors,” Caturegli told KrebsOnSecurity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just days after xAI's chatbot Grok sparked outrage for spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric and praising Adolf Hitler, the billionaire shifted the narrative by unveiling a new feature called Companions, which lets users interact with flirty, customizable AI avatars like Ani, a goth anime girl, and Rudy, a red panda. While xAI has apologized for Grok's previous behavior, the backlash hadn't fully died down. The timing of this release was telling, and effective. Within 48 hours, the Companions announcement racked up nearly 30 million views on X (formerly Twitter). The new Companion feature is part of a broader strategic pivot by Musk. While OpenAI and Meta race to make the most powerful language models, xAI is going after emotional engagement. He hinted that users may soon be able to create their own digital companions with customized voices, appearances, and personalities. “We will make this easier to turn on in a few days,” the CEO of Tesla and founder of xAI and SpaceX said in another post. But the reactions online show that people are split. SuperGrok now has two new companions for you, say hello to Ani and Rudy! “She sounds awesome,” one user replied under the announcement post. “Currently subscribed to a ton of AI tools: Grok, Claude, Manus, Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, and GitHub Copilot,” another added. “But after putting them all through the wringer, I'm about to hit ‘cancel' on most. I'm keeping Grok – it's smarter, funnier, and way less drama.” But critics were quick to point out the potential risks, especially for young men. “This is not going to help the birth rate,” one user warned. Musk himself has long voiced concern about declining birth rates in developed countries. Ironically, his own product may now be feeding the problem. When someone replied “gg birthrates,” Musk responded: “Or maybe they get better.” The Companion feature is clearly inspired by waifu culture, a subgenre of anime fandom where fans form emotional or romantic bonds with fictional characters. Platforms like Replika and Character.ai have long enabled similar AI relationships, with some users reporting deep attachments or even addiction. Now, Musk is bringing that dynamic to a global stage, with meme virality and billionaire marketing power behind it. And unlike most competitors, Grok Companions live inside X. That makes them not just personal assistants but viral agents of influence. And they feed engagement on Musk's struggling social media platform.

Meta is accelerating its investment in the infrastructure it believes will be needed to power the future of artificial intelligence training and inference, with a number of high-capacity, fast-deployment data centers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined plans for gigantic, "multi-GW clusters" at truly gargantuan scale, and he's doing it extremely quickly by leveraging a number of cost and time-saving measures inspired by xAI. Meta is also building "tented" data centers, rather than traditionally roofed structures. Deservedly, much has been said about the Meta's talent warsBut underrated is their extensive, vast, and fast moving infrastructure plan. Even if no one has quite made the AI business model profitable yet, that isn't stopping the world's largest tech companies from investing a collective hundreds of billions of dollars in powering the AI future they are so sure is coming. Alongside Nvidia pushing $500 billion global datacenter investment, and Elon Musk's xAI shipping a power station across the world, Meta is building a number of gigantic datacenters of its own. Although its Llama models might not be capturing the AI zeitgeist like Meta hoped, it may soon be leading the way in domestic AI compute power. Earlier this month, Semi-Analysis reported that Meta will be the first company to build out and deploy a gigawatt-scale datacenter for AI. That will give it over three billion TFLOPS of compute power, we're told. And according to Mark Zuckerberg, this is just the beginning. The 1GW "Prometheus" datacenter will come online in 2026, but Meta is also building "Hyperion," he said, which will take a few years to build up to scale and will eventually require as much as 5GW of power. Meta is also working on several other data centers in the longer term, and each of these "titan clusters" could be as large as a sizeable portion of Manhattan. The self-styled "Zuck" went on to say that "Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher," which may hint at the business model Meta is targeting. Semi-Analysis detailed how Meta has reinvented its datacenter strategy about building them with AI in mind. Meta will reportedly use a new "tent" style of structure that is faster to build and has less redundancy to further increase the pace of deployment. Where traditional data centers have backup diesel generators should they encounter a power outage, the new Meta sites will do away with that entirely.

Just hours after Nvidia announced that the sale of H20 chips in China is set to be approved by Washington, AMD has now confirmed it also plans to resume shipments of its MI308 chips in the country, following a similar shift by the administration. The company confirmed to Tom's Hardware that its license applications to export the chip will be moving forward for review, with the implied understanding that they will be granted. AMD says it was recently informed by the Department of Commerce that its license applications to export MI308 would be going ahead, and says it "plans to resume shipments as licenses are approved." As with Nvidia, AMD has chafed under restrictions on AI hardware export restrictions put forward by both the previous Biden administration and the current Trump administration. While not quite the $5.5 billion write-off suffered by Nvidia, that's enough to hurt anyone's bottom line, making today's shift in policy a welcome break for Team Red. AMD shares have surged by nearly 5% in pre-market trading following the news, a similar jump to Nvidia, as shareholders welcome the development. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been a notable detractor of such measures, calling export control a failure and praising President Trump's move to roll back the AI diffusion rule. Huang has repeatedly stated that export controls could limit U.S. power in the advancing world of AI and force countries like China to look inward for innovation and alternative hardware solutions, possibly buoying the country's efforts rather than stalling them. He reiterated that in order for America to have AI leadership," it needs to make sure the American tech stack is available to markets all over the world."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. And you don't know chapped hands until you've been wrist-deep in hot, soapy water multiple times a day. Enter the baby bottle washer: A unicorn for new parents. Just plop in the dirty bottles, fill the water reservoir, and in less than two hours you have sparkling-clean, ready-to-go bottles. It's a game changer, and I've lost count of “well in my day …” comments I've received during the testing process of these miracle machines. But here at WIRED, we're getting ahead of the curve and have tested every baby bottle washer available to see if the appliance is worth it. The interior cavity is deep, and the tray is wide enough to hold a variety of bottle and pump parts without issue. I had no trouble fitting everything from tall eight-ounce bottles to short, wide ones and pump flanges inside the machine. The machine has four core modes—Quick Wash (19 minutes), Normal Wash (29 minutes), Sterilize and Dry, and Storage—customizable into nine combinations, so you can mix‑and‑match cycles to suit your schedule. The Grownsy is surprisingly quiet—there are no rumbling sounds, just the subtle sounds of swishing water, which I find calming in a quiet house during nap time. But if you've got the room, it's an efficient and reliable option, and it's less expensive than its competitors. It paved the way for what I think will be a booming baby product in the next few years, and the Brezza specifically is consistently a top seller across retailers, so it felt like a natural to try first. It washes and sterilizes well, and it uses less water than many competitors—great if you're working with limited filtered or purified water. Like most bottle washers I've tried, some pieces may still come out a little wet even after the dry cycle, but that's pretty standard. Not only does it look (and sound) like a rocket ship on the counter, but you also need to take into consideration the clearance needed above the machine so that steam won't warp your cabinets. The racks are fixed and shallow, which works fine for standard bottles, but wide bottles or pump flanges can feel cramped or tip over if you're not meticulous. And taking the lid off when it's full can be awkward; it's easy to knock things over if you're not careful. If counter real estate is limited or you need flexibility for various bottle sizes and pump parts, it can be a bit picky, but if you're looking for a dependable, hands-off solution to bottle cleaning, the Baby Brezza is a solid pick. The Momcozy KleanPal Pro Baby Bottle Washer is sleek and looks as good on a countertop as any hefty tabletop washing machine can. It comes in a clean, soft white with teal accents and blends into most kitchen decor. In terms of appearance—and even some facets of performance—the Momcozy and the Grownsy machines are strikingly similar, though a few subtle differences set them apart. The machine also has a rapid wash cycle option, which is a quick 19 minutes, but you can't pair Rapid Wash with Dry. To me, this kind of defeats the purpose of the quick-wash option; I'd probably just wash by hand if I needed bottles in a rush. The spray appears gentler, which is great for noise control but made me question its cleaning power. I occasionally noticed some residue on intricate bottle and pump parts, especially compared to the Brezza, which definitely sounds like it's working hard. Can I Wash Other Baby Items in a Bottle Washer? Check the instructions of the specific bottle washer you're using, but most machines can wash things like pacifiers, breast pump parts, and small toys and teethers, so long as the pieces are steam-resistant. How Often Should I Clean a Baby Bottle Washer? How Do I Clean a Baby Bottle Washer? Follow the instructions for your machine, and make sure to rinse all parts well afterward. Do I Have to Use the Brand's Detergent Tablets? All bottle washing machines are calibrated for their own dissolvable tablets. Can I Wash Glass Bottles in a Bottle Washer? Just make sure the glass bottles are dishwasher-safe, and handle them carefully when loading and unloading, especially because glass will hold heat from the dryer. Also avoid sudden temperature swings (like moving an ice‑cold bottle straight into a hot cycle) to prevent cracking. How Long Does a Typical Cleaning Cycle Take? I tested these bottle washing machines in my own kitchen as a new parent to a now 8-month-old, starting when my daughter was around 3 months. I tested each machine for at least a month, running two cleaning cycles a day early on when she was still taking bottles overnight. Now that she's sleeping through the night, we've settled into one full wash per day. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content.

Quinn Nelson, the creator behind popular YouTube channel Snazzy Labs, fell foul to the long arm of Nintendo law, and now assumes the “old copy of Bayo 3 on eBay” they bought must have been dumped/ripped by its previous owner and got flagged by big N's anti-piracy servers. Bought an old copy of Bayo 3 on eBay and WELP, my 1-month-old $450 Switch 2 is BANNED.This cart must have been dumped by whoever owned it before me.Hoping Nintendo will understand/unlock for me, else, this SUCKS! Nelson kindly posted the above warning as a PSA (public service announcement) for other Switch 2 owners who may be considering building their game library via the used market. “Be EXTREMELY careful buying used Nintendo Switch games,” they stress. All access to Nintendo's online services have been cut off. To be clear, if this happens to you, the physical cartridges that you own will remain playable, without updates, and some previously downloaded digital games may remain accessible. Other social media users were quick to reassure Nelson of two things. Firstly, hardware bans received for using second-hand game carts that have been cloned by tools like MIG Flash are not uncommon. And, probably more importantly, Nintendo is receptive to owners who can provide corroborating evidence that they are innocent of Nintendo-flavored piracy. All that seems to be required to iron out this digital wrinkle is some online correspondence with Nintendo and some kind of paper trail (or screenshots) showing that the offending game cart was bought used without any awareness of bad provenance. Not all social media responses to Nelson's situation were supportive, though – this is X in 2025., afterall A particular point was raised by Centro LEAKS, a Pokémon leaks, rumors and news site, which highlighted Nelson's previous posts, one mentioning that he intended to run “my MIG Flash game dumps” on the Switch 2. This is the best way to carry all of your physical games all at once without risking a ban on an unmodded console. Nelson clarified in that referenced Tweet that he used the flash cart to vastly improve the portability of a large game collection. Not your own," implying he doesn't think the ban is related to this activity. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Taking Nelson's claims at face value, let's hope they get their Switch 2 back online shortly. Having an almost new console restricted and locked down like this, while being innocent of any piracy, would definitely not be fair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People occasionally ask me if AI is coming for my job. The robot is a side project from Seattle Ultrasonics, a tiny operation run by Scott Heimendinger, an alumni of Modernist Cuisine and Anova, and cofounder of the beloved Sansaire sous vide company. Before all that, he was at Microsoft, working on software that became Power Query and Power BI. More recently, he's been working on creating an ultrasonic knife for home kitchens, due out later in 2025. But it's Heimendinger's data-gathering side project, which he calls the Quantified Knife Project, that has grabbed my attention. For the experiment, he bought 21 chef's knives, attached them to a robot arm, ran them through a battery of tests, then crunched the gobs of data to calculate a "food cutting rank." To do all of his testing, he did a weekday's worth of ingredient shopping, queued up the Real Genius soundtrack, and ran his robot arm hard over a full weekend to collect the data. That's 525 individual robot cuts, from which Heimendinger accrued 100,000 data points for his rankings. Dedicated knife nerds will be happy to know that he also ran each knife through a BESS sharpness test that measures the force needed to cut through a synthetic wire and sent the blades away for CATRA edge-retention tests. He then incorporated that data into the cutting rank. I suppose I should have been scared, or even jealous, of what he and his robot arm were doing. There were things I was curious about, and while I might have made little modifications to the tests or chosen different knives, mostly it just felt exciting. The Excel nerd now had reams of data. I wanted to see for myself how he was testing, learn more about the knives he thought were best, compare our testing styles, and see how my favorite knife compared to his. I put that favorite knife, a Glestain with enormous dimples, in my knife roll and went to visit Heimendinger at his downtown Seattle lab. There's a lot to take in in his tiny space: a drill press, 3-D printers, specialized photo and video gear, a tiny shop vac, optical and digital microscopes, his “crazy handy” oscilloscope. There's also the robot arm, a uFactory xArm 6, which he has dubbed Dr. J. You can move this "cobot,” or collaborative robot, around while it records the movements, then it will mimic those movements over and over again. "It means it knows how much force is being applied and can stop if too much resistance is being met," he says. In other words, if you've got the settings right, it won't chop through your table or your arm. Scott took my knife, attached it to the robot's gripper, and started collecting data, running through the same battery of tests as his other 21 knives. He mounts everything he's cutting to a 3-D printed plate with spikes that keep it from rolling or sliding away. That sits on a scale connected to his computer, allowing him to create a graph of how much force is being applied as the blade moves through the food. After the fifth tomato, I had to know how my knife did. Without judgment, Heimendinger announced that it placed "second to last in the cohort." I felt responsibility for this knife, and a little embarrassment, until I remembered his knives came straight out of the box and into the testing process with an unblemished factory edge. My knife, on the other hand, had been in regular use in my test kitchen for more than six months receiving only the occasional honing. Plus, I noted protectively that these tomatoes appeared bigger than the ones he used during his main battery of testing. He continued through the other four foods: potatoes, cheese cubes, baby carrots, and King's Hawaiian rolls, the latter chosen for their extremely uniform interior. Bread rolls were also used in the testing. Understandably, my knife didn't fare particularly well, but I was able to get an appreciation for Scott's testing and data-gathering process. Every piece of food needed to be loaded and unloaded from the scale, the knife wiped, cleaned, and dried after every stroke, the room kept cool, the whole thing happening during that monotonous bender of a weekend, Don Henley and Tears for Fears playing over and over. Number four was weird: The $300 Wüsthof Amici (very similar to their fantastic Classic but with a different bolster and handle) aced everything except the carrots, at which it was quite bad. The last two slots, 20 and 21, were also well secured, by a Henckels Classic and the $18 Zwilling Solution Fine Edge. Yet the stuff in the middle—slots five to 19, more than two-thirds of the test group—were what he was referring to when he said “scattered,” performing well in one category and poorly in another. "You would think that a great tomato knife would make a great potato knife," he said before noting that wasn't necessarily the case. Tomatoes are a real test of slicing ability. Those three knives at the top of his rankings feel like safe bets. I'd even feel pretty good about lumping that Wusthöf in there. And if I had been considering purchasing one of those two at the bottom of his list, I'd abandon the idea. For his part, Scott appreciated their lack of predictability. This might be the first time we're understanding that what matters for a tomato is different than what matters for a potato," he said. I thought he was going to generalize about blades, but instead he said the Wüsthof Amici, which, thanks to a particularly well-honed apex, just sliced right through. Then again, the way I test probably feels subjective to other reviewers. If it were my test, I'd make Dr. Choppenheimer's tomato motion more of a slice. Something I'd want to feel more sure of are things this testing doesn't take into account. Is the top of the spine rounded where pinch-grip user would lay their index finger over it so they get blisters while chopping up a bag of onions? Is it weighted in a way you like? Some knives are center-weighted while others feel heavier toward the front of the blade or back in the handle; years ago I tested a Shun nakiri that was super weight forward, which, I learned, was not my jam. What you like about a knife is very personal. If you don't take stuff like that into account, the possibility that you'll like your new knife is kinda up in the air. I'd noticed his ability to be dispassionate about his wall of beautiful knives he'd amassed for testing, but I still I hoped he'd be interested, even excited about mine, with its monster dimples. These will make for better numbers," when he ran it through the BESS tests. As someone who wears his knife-sharpness pride on his sleeve, I was happy to see that the Glestain leapt into eighth place in his rankings after it had been sharpened. Not that the two of us had staked out opposing positions on that first day in the lab, but I started appreciating how this data would make a nice addition to my kind of testing. He certainly understands the value of hands-on time with whatever blade you're researching. If you buy a knife that feels good and is backed up by his data, I dare say you'll be ready to slice and dice to your heart's content. You could hold the worst performer and love it," he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research shows models can be directly edited to hide selected voices, even when users specifically ask for them. A technique known as “machine unlearning” could teach AI models to forget specific voices—an important step in stopping the rise of audio deepfakes, where someone's voice is copied to carry out fraud or scams. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have revolutionized the quality of text-to-speech technology so that people can convincingly re-create a piece of text in any voice, complete with natural speaking patterns and intonations, instead of having to settle for a robotic voice reading it out word by word. “Anyone's voice can be reproduced or copied with just a few seconds of their voice,” says Jong Hwan Ko, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea and the coauthor of a new paper that demonstrates one of the first applications of machine unlearning to speech generation. Copied voices have been used in scams, disinformation, and harassment. Ko, who researches audio processing, and his collaborators wanted to prevent this kind of identity fraud. “People are starting to demand ways to opt out of the unknown generation of their voices without consent,” he says. There is a big elephant in the room: outright bans might not even be technically feasible. AI companies generally keep a tight grip on their models to discourage misuse. However, as many examples over time have shown, clever prompt engineering or model fine-tuning can sometimes get these models to say things they otherwise wouldn't. Machine unlearning instead asks whether an AI can be made to forget a piece of information that the company doesn't want it to know. The technique takes a leaky model and the specific training data to be redacted and uses them to create a new model—essentially, a version of the original that never learned that piece of data. While machine unlearning has ties to older techniques in AI research, it's only in the past couple of years that it's been applied to large language models. Jinju Kim, a master's student at Sungkyunkwan University who worked on the paper with Ko and others, sees guardrails as fences around the bad data put in place to keep people away from it. But unlearning, she says, attempts to remove the bad data altogether, so there is nothing behind the fence at all. The way current text-to-speech systems are designed complicates this a little more, though. These so-called “zero-shot” models use examples of people's speech to learn to re-create any voice, including those not in the training set—with enough data, it can be a good mimic when supplied with even a small sample of someone's voice. So “unlearning” means a model not only needs to “forget” voices it was trained on but also has to learn not to mimic specific voices it wasn't trained on. All the while, it still needs to perform well for other voices. To demonstrate how to get those results, Kim taught a recreation of VoiceBox, a speech generation model from Meta, that when it was prompted to produce a text sample in one of the voices to be redacted, it should instead respond with a random voice. In practice, this makes the new voice unmistakably different. While these percentages are a bit hard to interpret, the demo the researchers released online offers very convincing results, both for how well redacted speakers are forgotten and how well the rest are remembered. A sample from the demo is given below. Their method also requires an audio clip about five minutes long for each speaker whose voice is to be forgotten. In machine unlearning, pieces of data are often replaced with randomness so that they can't be reverse-engineered back to the original. “I have seen people optimizing for randomness in other contexts,” says Vaidehi Patil, a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who researches machine unlearning. Machine unlearning may still be at too early a stage for, say, Meta to introduce Ko and Kim's methods into VoiceBox. But there is likely to be industry interest. Patil is researching unlearning for Google DeepMind this summer, and while Meta did not respond with a comment, it has hesitated for a long time to release VoiceBox to the wider public because it is so vulnerable to misuse. The voice unlearning team seems optimistic that its work could someday get good enough for real-life deployment. “In real applications, we would need faster and more scalable solutions,” says Ko.
