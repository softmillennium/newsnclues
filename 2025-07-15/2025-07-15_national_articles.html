                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that last week's memo declining to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “speaks for itself,” rejecting questions about making more documents public. “Today our memo speaks for itself, and we will get back to you about anything else,” Bondi told reporters Tuesday, responding to questions about President Donald Trump's earlier comment that Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible.” At the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he stood behind Bondi, responding to a question about his daughter-in-law Lara Trump saying that there needs to be “more transparency” around the Epstein investigation. “I would like to see that also,” the president added, in an apparent reference to the call for more transparency. Additionally, Trump said Bondi has not told him that his name appears in the Epstein files, despite previous accusations from ex-Trump ally Elon Musk. Bondi's comments came during a press conference at the Drug Enforcement Agency, highlighting law enforcement seizures of 64,000 pounds of methamphetamines — including those in pill form — in drug busts since January. Though the surge in drugs like meth-laced pills is a national threat — and drug cases are of particular importance to the attorney general — it was not enough to divert attention from the Epstein controversy. The department is keen to change the current conversation around Epstein, sources tell CNN, and is prioritizing putting Bondi in front of cameras to discuss other Trump priorities like the drug busts discussed Tuesday. Bondi repeatedly said she would not answer questions on the matter. Bondi said that she, Patel and Bongino are “all committed” to “fighting as a team” to accomplish Trump administration priorities like reducing violent crime. “I'm going to be here as long as the president wants me here, and I believe he's made that crystal clear it's four years,” Bondi said of the drama and subsequent calls for her resignation. “Well, three and a half now, right?” she said. Trump was also asked at the White House if he has faith in Bongino, who CNN has reported has clashed with Bondi over the release of files related to the Epstein investigation.

In a press gaggle on Thursday, President Donald Trump hailed the Big Beautiful Bill's passing both houses of Congress and referred to it as an economic "rocket ship." FIRST ON FOX: The White House rolled out an interactive map of the U.S. showing the savings Americans can expect from initiatives under President Donald Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act on a state-by-state basis, Fox News Digital learned Tuesday. Trump signed the massive piece of legislation into law on the Fourth of July, touting that its tax cuts will make the U.S. economy similar to a "rocket ship" as Americans begin feeling its effects. On Tuesday, the White House published an interactive map of the 50 states that provides breakdowns of how much Americans can expect to save and see in their pocketbooks compared to if the bill had not been passed and signed into law. The interactive map focused on data such as: real wage increases, which are understood as the increase to a worker's income after accounting for inflation; a family's expected real take-home pay increase; how many seniors benefit from the no tax on Social Security; the percentage of a state's labor force who are expected to benefit from not paying taxes on tips; the number of jobs protected in a state, and other data. President Donald Trump rallied Republican lawmakers to pass a massive piece of legislation advancing his administration's agenda. In California, the nation's most populated state, residents can expect a real wage increase of $4,900 to $8,800 and a real take-home pay increase of $8,500 to $12,500 for a typical family with two kids, according to the map. "A typical family with two children in California can expect to see higher take-home pay of about $8500 to $12500 with OBBB compared to if it was not passed," states the map, which includes links to more detailed data on any given state. Around 6.0 million seniors in California could benefit from the no taxes on Social Security provision of the OBBB." On the East Coast, residents of New Jersey can expect real wage increases of $5,000 to $9,000, and a real take-home pay increase of $8,600 to $12,700 for typical families with two children, according to the data reviewed by Fox News Digital. New Yorkers can expect a $4,400 to $8,000 real wage increase, and a real take-home pay increase of $8,000 to $11,700, data show. Trump had been rallying Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation since the early days of his administration this year, as it advances his agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. House Speaker Mike Johnson played a pivotal role in passing the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act for Trump's signature on July 4, 2025. House and Senate Republicans delivered the legislation to Trump's desk in July after a hard-fought battle that included a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in their condemnation of the bill, mostly over its increase to the debt limit. It also rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump's mass deportation efforts, and institutes Medicaid reforms. "That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country.… After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.… It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families.… The Golden Age of America is upon us." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised the bill in an opinion piece published on Fox News Digital earlier in July, celebrating that Americans can expect to keep "an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages." "The bill prevents a $4.5 trillion tax hike on the American people," he wrote in an op-ed published July 4. Add to this the president's ambitious deregulation agenda, which could save the average family of four an additional $10,000. "The One Big Beautiful Bill also codifies no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay — both policies designed to provide financial relief to America's working class," he added. "These tax breaks will ensure Main Street workers keep more of their hard-earned income. And they will bolster productivity by rewarding Americans who work extra hours. All Americans can learn how President Trump's tax cuts will impact their lives for the better with a new White House calculator."

Former White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, nominee for U.S. Representative to the United Nations, wears a watch as he attends a Senate Foreign Relations Committee nomination hearing, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Mike Waltz painted an image for lawmakers Tuesday of what the United Nations would look like as the U.S. — its largest donor — reviews its support, opting to go “back to basics” under a Trump administration push to “make the U.N. great again.” It was the first time senators could grill Waltz since he was ousted as Trump's national security adviser in May after he mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans. On the agenda for Waltz would be combating China's influence, reviewing U.S. funding to U.N. agencies with “often duplicative and wasteful mandates,” as well as rooting out what Waltz called deep antisemitism within the U.N. system. The Signal episode — in which Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other high-level officials faced intense criticism — didn't come up at the hearing for more than an hour. It was revealed in March that Waltz added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen. “We both know Signal is not an appropriate and secure means of communicating highly sensitive information,” said Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who was first to raise the issue. He added that Waltz shared “demonstrably sensitive information” in an improper manner. Fellow Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia called it “an amateurish move.” “What's been troubling to me about your nomination from the beginning is your failure to just stand up and take accountability for mistakes that you made.” The world body is reeling from Trump's decision to slash foreign assistance — affecting its humanitarian aid agencies — and it anticipates U.S. funding cuts to the U.N. annual budget. Facing financial instability, the U.N. has spent months shedding jobs and consolidating projects while beginning to tackle long-delayed reforms. The U.N. is also facing growing frustration over what critics describe as a lack of efficiency and power in delivering on its mandate to end conflict. “The U.S. must ensure that every foreign aid dollar and every contribution to an international organization, particularly the U.N., draws a straight and direct line to a compelling U.S. national interest,” Waltz said. He said the administration's diplomatic strategy would be focused on cutting costs to what he called “waste, fraud, and abuse that are endemic to the U.N. system.” Waltz also accused the U.N. of “pervasive antisemitism.” He testified that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has been promoting “antisemitic hate” in its schools in Gaza. Israel later alleged that about 100 other Palestinians in Gaza were Hamas members but didn't provide evidence to the United Nations. A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Waltz stayed on to “ensure a smooth and successful transition given the extreme importance of the role of NSA.” Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, questioned why Waltz was still being paid by the administration. Associated Press writers Edith M. Lederer at the U.N. and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon provides an update after nine people were killed and over 30 injured after a fire broke out at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts on Sunday, July 13, 2025. A survivor of a Sunday blaze that tore through an assisted living facility in Massachusetts has claimed that staff members abandoned the burning scene leaving the elderly residents to fend for themselves – while another said that workers didn't even knock at doors to alert the seniors as the flames spread. Resident Lorraine Ferrara, 70, told the Associated Press of her shock to see staff running away from the fire that ultimately killed 9 people and injured dozens more at Gabriel House in Fall River. "They left us alone and ran," Ferrara said. "I was hanging out the window — ‘Help! Michael Pimentel, center, a resident at the Gabriel House assisted living facility, in Fall River, Mass., receives assistance from an emergency medical worker outside a temporary shelter on July 14, 2025, in Fall River, following a fire that started late Sunday. Meanwhile, resident Robert Cabral also said that workers fled the terrifying scene as smoke filled rooms. "They didn't knock on one door," Cabral said. Fox News Digital reached out to Gabriel Care, the operators of the facility, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. As well as workers apparently fleeing the scene, reports have emerged of an alleged lack of fire drills at the facility, while a firefighters union said inadequate staffing hindered the response to the blaze. Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts Secretary of Elder Affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned by reports about the apparent lack of fire drills as well a low number of staff for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows. "It's a terrible tragedy that should have never happened," Lanzikos told the Associated Press. A fire erupted at an assisted living residence in Massachusetts on Sunday, killing at least nine residents. About 50 firefighters responded to the scene at around 9:50 p.m., including 30 who were off duty. Police also helped break down doors and carried about a dozen residents to safety. Five injured firefighters were released from the hospital Monday. Edward Kelly, president of the national firefighters union, said eight additional firefighters would have been on scene if national staffing recommendations were followed. Frank O'Reagan said there was no breathing equipment available when he arrived, so he started going door to door on the third floor without an air tank until the smoke got to him. O'Reagan's brother and fellow firefighter Michael O'Reagan said he was shocked that 40 minutes after firefighters arrived, a large part of the building had not been searched. A fire broke out at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts on Sunday, July 13, 2025. Officials said it did not appear suspicious, Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon told Boston 25 News that staffing levels is not unique to Fall River and that municipalities across the Commonwealth face similar concerns. "The crews were faced with an incredibly difficult situation. "When you combine the two at the level this call asked for, it was almost an impossible situation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A demonstrator holds a sign during a protest against the Trump administration's new travel bans, June 9, 2025, at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at the Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles. President Donald Trump speaks during the White House Faith Office luncheon in the State Dining Room, Monday, July 14, 2025, in Washington. In a decision late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle said President Donald Trump's June order banning the entry of people from 12 countries “expressly states” that it does not limit the ability of people to seek refugee status. The order, dubbed “Proclamation 10949—Restricting The Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,” includes a provision that says nothing in it “shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT, consistent with the laws of the United States.” In his ruling, Whitehead said “by its plain terms, the Proclamation excludes refugees from its scope.” He ordered the administration to immediately resume processing 80 “presumptively protected refugees” that were rejected based on the travel ban. The State Department did not immediately have comment Tuesday. The decision left thousands of refugees who had already gone through a sometimes years-long vetting process to start new lives in America stranded at various locations around the world, including relatives of active-duty U.S. military personnel and more than 1,600 Afghans who assisted America's war efforts. Under a framework established by an appellate court, those refugees should be admitted if they had previously been cleared for travel to the U.S., had arranged and confirmable travel plans and had taken steps such as selling property or giving up their home that showed a reliance on the U.S. government's assurance of their refugee status. The administration has previously said 12,000 people had been approved and booked for travel as refugees before it suspended the refugee program. Many of those cases will now have to be examined individually to see whether they meet the appeals court's criteria for entry. The lawsuit Whitehead is overseeing was filed in February by some individual refugees along with refugee aid organizations who said the administration froze their funding. Whitehead said the suspension likely amounted to a nullification of congressional will, since Congress created and funded the refugee admissions program. He issued a preliminary injunction barring the federal government from suspending refugee processing and refugee aid funding. Circuit Court of Appeals put most of that decision on hold in March, finding the administration was likely to win the case because the president has broad authority to determine who is allowed to enter the country.</p>

It's a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the game, a system that might forever change one of the ficklest parts of an incredibly fickle game: The ever-changing, unpredictable strike zone put in place by all-too-human home plate umpires. Pitchers are largely unfazed – at least before the game gets going. I'm probably not going to use them in the future. “Pitchers think that everything's a strike, then you go back and look at it and it's two, three balls off,” he said Monday. “So, we should not be the ones that are challenging it. I think this is one of those things that you kind of think that umpires are great until they're not, and so I could kind of care less either way, to be honest.” According to MLB, the challenge system will have the same rules as were used in spring training: Each team starts the game with two challenges and they keep their challenge if they are deemed correct. Only the pitcher, catcher and hitter can challenge a call and the system is put into place when one of those players taps the top of his cap or helmet twice. Play would then resume after the short break. It's unclear exactly how the league will determine the size of those strike zones for each batter, and that's something Los Angeles Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw wants to know. “I did a few rehab starts with it. “I just don't really understand how they're doing the box for the hitter, because I think every different TV or national streaming service has their own box. I think I just hope that they figure out, because Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes, so … know they've obviously thought about that. I haven't talked to MLB about it, but as long as that gets figured out, I think it'd be fun.” It's one of the things that can make baseball so perfectly imperfect – the ability of umpires to simply get it wrong and make a massive impact on the game. From Jim Joyce ruling a batter safe to ruin Armando Galarraga's perfect game bid to Don Dekinger's World Series-changing call in 1985, ruling Kansas City Royals player Jorge Orta was safe at first base even though replays showed he was out by a step. But it's also something that many fans would rather see cast off into obscurity. Chris Sale, the Atlanta Braves pitcher and reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, said he still wants it to be part of the game. “Honestly, for me, I kind of like the human element, right? Like I understand why they want to use ABS. And I don't think it's a perfect system yet,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration NEW YORK (AP) — As his supporters erupt over the Justice Department's failure to release much-hyped records in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking investigation, President Donald Trump's strategy has been to downplay the issue. That nothing-to-see-here approach doesn't work for those who have learned from him that they must not give up until the government's deepest, darkest secrets are exposed. Trump quickly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi and chided a reporter for daring to ask about the documents. This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. On Saturday, Trump used his Truth Social platform to again attempt to call supporters off the Epstein trail amid reports of infighting between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the issue. He suggested the turmoil was undermining his administration — “all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.” At least one follower responded to Trump's post by saying it seemed as though the president was just trying to make the issue go away — but assured him it wouldn't. The political crisis is especially challenging for Trump because it's one of his own making. “The faulty assumption Trump and others make is they can peddle conspiracy theories without any blowback,” said Matt Dallek, a political scientist at George Washington University. Last week's two-page statement from the Justice Department and the FBI saying they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a client list roiled Trump's supporters, who pointed to past statements from several administration officials that the list ought to be revealed. Bondi had suggested in February that such a document was sitting on her desk waiting for review, though last week she said she had been referring generally to the Epstein case file and not a specific client list. Far-right commentator Jack Posobiec said at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit on Saturday that he would not rest “until we go full Jan. 6 committee on the Jeffrey Epstein files.” Trump's weekend post sought to divert attention by calling on supporters to focus instead on investigating Democrats and arresting criminals rather than “spending month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein.” His first-term national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, pleaded with him to reconsider. “@realdonaldtrump please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away,” Flynn wrote, adding that failing to address unanswered Epstein questions would make facing other national challenges “much harder.” She told Politico's Playbook newsletter on Sunday that a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the handling of the files on Epstein, who was found dead in his federal jail cell in 2019 about a month after he was arrested. Experts who study conspiracy theories warned that more sunlight does not necessarily make far-fetched narratives disappear. The president and many figures in his administration — including Bondi,Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel — earned their political capital over the years in part by encouraging disproven conspiracy theories on a range of topics, from elections to vaccines. FBI Director Kash Patel testifies during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 8, 2025. Last week, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted on X what seemed like an endorsement of a notorious conspiracy theory that the contrails left by aircraft are releasing chemicals for potentially nefarious reasons. He said Trump has exploited that “more ably than anybody probably in American history.” That's because it's rooted in truth: A wealthy and well-connected financier did spend years abusing large numbers of young girls while escaping justice. As a result, Trump needs to come forward with truth and transparency on the topic, Muirhead said. If he doesn't, “large segments of his most enthusiastic and devoted supporters are going to lose faith in him.” Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk speaks during a campaign rally, Oct. 24, 2024, in Las Vegas. As right-wing outrage over Epstein dominates the political conversation, Democrats and other Trump rivals have been taking advantage. Several Democratic lawmakers have called for the release of all Epstein files and suggested Trump could be resisting because he or someone close to him is featured in them. Conservatives expressed concerns that Trump's approach on Epstein could hurt them in the midterms. “For this to go away, you're going to lose 10% of the MAGA movement,” right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon said during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit on Friday. And Loomer, who is close to Trump, said Friday she was told that Bongino was “seriously thinking about resigning.” Bongino showed up at work Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues. “It's possible at some time voters are going to notice the things they want or expect government to do aren't being done because the people in charge are either incompetent or off chasing rabbits,” he said.

Former White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, nominee for U.S. Representative to the United Nations, attends a Senate Foreign Relations Committee nomination hearing, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. As Mike Waltz, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday for his confirmation hearing, focus returns to his ousting as national security adviser over what some referred to as “Signalgate.” The former Florida Republican congressman served mere weeks in Trump's administration before revelations that he mistakenly added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic to a private Signal chat that was used to discuss sensitive military plans, including planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen. Calls came quickly for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be removed from office, accompanied by criticism of the Trump administration for failing to take action against the top national security officials who discussed plans for the military strike in Signal. After weeks of scrutiny, Waltz left his security post but was swiftly nominated to the U.N. position. Months after the chat was disclosed, questions remain over the controversy, including if federal laws were violated, if classified information was exposed on the commercial messaging app and if anyone else will face consequences. KNOWN: Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked. It is not approved for carrying classified information. One known vulnerability is that a malicious actor, if they have access to a person's phone, can link their own device to the user's Signal — and monitor messages remotely. NOT KNOWN: How frequently the administration and the Defense Department use Signal for sensitive government communications, and whether those on the chat were using unauthorized personal devices to transmit or receive those messages. The department put out an instruction in 2023 restricting what information could be posted on unauthorized and unclassified systems. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard would not say whether she was accessing the information on her personal phone or government-issued phone, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Security Council. KNOWN: Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon's security protocols — known in the IT industry as a “dirty” internet line — set up in his office to use Signal on a personal computer, two people familiar with the line have told The Associated Press. Other Pentagon offices have used them, particularly if there's a need to monitor information or websites that would otherwise be blocked. NOT KNOWN: If use of the line left any Defense-related materials more vulnerable than they would have been on a Pentagon secure line. The group, called “Houthi PC Small Group,” likely for Houthi “principals committee” — was comprised of Trump's senior-most advisers on national security, including Gabbard, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Gabbard, Ratcliffe and the White House have all said it was not classified, and Hegseth said the same in a post on social media. KNOWN: Hegseth has adamantly denied that “war plans” were texted on Signal, something current and former U.S. officials called “semantics.” War plans carry a specific meaning. They often refer to the numbered and highly classified planning documents — sometimes thousands of pages long — that would inform U.S. decisions in case of a major conflict. But the information Hegseth did post — specific attack details selecting human and weapons storage targets — was a subset of those plans and was likely informed by the same classified intelligence. Posting those details to an unclassified app risked tipping off adversaries of the pending attack and could have put U.S. service members at risk, multiple U.S. officials said. Sharing that information on a commercial app like Signal in advance of a strike “would be a violation of everything that we're about,” said former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who served under Democratic President Barack Obama. KNOWN: Hegseth began cracking down on unauthorized leaks of information inside the Defense Department, and his chief of staff issued a memo on March 21 saying the Pentagon would use polygraph tests to determine the sources of recent leaks and prosecute them. KNOWN: In April, Dan Caldwell, a senior Hegseth adviser who in the Signal chat had been designated as the secretary's point person, was placed on administrative leave and escorted out of the Pentagon by security. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters told The AP that the former Marine's sudden downfall was tied to an investigation into unauthorized disclosure of department information. NOT KNOWN: If any others affiliated with the Signal situation will face reprisals. KNOWN: Also in April, Hegseth was forced to defend himself against a second assertion that he shared classified material through an unapproved and unsecured network, this time taking airstrike information from a military communications channel and sharing it in a Signal chat with his wife, his brother and others. A person familiar with the chat confirmed to The AP that Hegseth pulled the information — such as launch times and bomb drop times of U.S. warplanes about to strike Houthi targets in Yemen — he posted in the chat from a secure communications channel used by U.S. Central Command. NOT KNOWN: If that's the extent of Hegseth's Signal usage. KNOWN: The Pentagon's watchdog has begun looking into Hegseth's use of Signal, and also whether any of Hegseth's aides were asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter. NOT KNOWN: What the inspector general will find, or what will be done as a result of those findings.</p>

Counterterrorism expert Jonathan Gilliam said Iranian sleeper cells might be hiding "in plain sight" as Iran has issued threats against America. A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman confirmed Tuesday that five Iranians were arrested while attempting to illegally cross the U.S. northern border with Canada. "On July 1, Border Patrol Agents from the Champlain, New York Station, responded to suspicious activity near Mooers Forks, NY," CBP's Swanton Sector said on Facebook. Swanton is a rural town in Vermont near Highway 89 just south of the Canadian Border.

The Stowe Community Church surrounded by green forest and mountain, Vermont, United States. CBP said that all seven men had been previously arrested for attempting to cross the border illegally. All seven aliens are detained and awaiting deportation. "They are currently detained and pending removal proceedings," CBP said. Earlier this month, a counterterrorism expert told Fox News Digital that Iranian terrorist sleeper cells could be hiding in plain sight. The U.S. military crippled several Iranian nuclear sites after targeted airstrikes on June 22. "Where these sleeper cells may be is in plain sight," former FBI special agent and terrorism task force member Jonathan Gilliam said. "And that's the real terrifying part of this is that putting people in place, as we've seen over the past four years, everyone's scrambling because certain amounts of people could come in here and get in here." Gilliam pointed to the Biden administration's border policies as a reason for concern. "They could even go to the border and say they [want to] seek asylum, and the Biden administration, instead of putting them into DHS housing or ICE housing and holding them there so they could have their first appearance. To be vetted and whether or not they get asylum," he said. In a 2023 terrorism report released by the State Department in December of last year, the federal government outlined numerous instances of worrying behavior by Iranian nationals in western countries. "In 2023 the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging three individuals connected with Iran in a plot to assassinate an Iranian dissident in New York City," that report said. "Also in 2023, a United Kingdom court found a man guilty of attempting to collect information for terrorist purposes on the London-based Iran International, a media company that is critical of the Iranian regime." Iranian worshippers hold up their hands as signs of unity with Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during an anti-Israeli rally to condemn Israel's attacks on Iran, in downtown Tehran, Iran, on June 20, 2025. Denmark similarly recalled its ambassador from Tehran after learning of an Iran-backed plot to kill an Iranian dissident in that country." Fox News' Adam Sabes contributed to this report.

This year's event will take place at Bethpage Black outside of New York City. It will be the second time a team competition has been in the tri-state area, along with the 2017 Presidents Cup at Liberty National in Jersey City. Xander Schauffele, right, and his father pose for a photo after the United States victory in the 2020 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits on Sept. 26, 2021 in Kohler, Wisconsin. Xander Schauffele has been a part of Team USA for each Ryder and Presidents Cup since 2019, and he currently has an automatic bid as the second-ranked American in the FedEx Cup standings (the top six players get automatic bids). However, his own dad wants no part of it. Stefan Schauffele told The London Times that he is "not going" to the Ryder Cup in September. "I'm afraid of what's going to happen in New York. I was there [at Whistling Straits] when they called Shane Lowry's wife a whore in front of him. I couldn't believe my ears," Stefan revealed. Shane Lowry of Team Europe and wife Wendy Lowry pose with the Ryder Cup Trophy before departing Heathrow Airport ahead of the 43rd Ryder Cup on Sept. 20, 2021 in London. Stefan also said he was turned off by the tempers flaring between Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava, in Rome two years ago. McIlroy was not happy with LaCava's celebration of a long putt from Cantlay, who opted not to wear a hat in protest of players not being paid to play in the event. "That was utterly disgusting claiming this money bulls---, and Rory behaved disgustingly in my opinion," Schauffele continued. It's ruined my appetite for the Ryder Cup. Team Europe's Rory McIlroy, left, argues with Joe LaCava, caddie of USA's Patrick Cantlay, on the 18th during the four balls on day two of the 44th Ryder Cup at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome on Saturday, Sept. 30, 2023. The rivalry between the two teams is undoubtedly hotter than ever - but apparently, Mr. Schauffele has no interest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley raised no money in the latest campaign finance reporting period, despite being up for reelection next year. Bradley has not formally announced her reelection bid but told WisPolitics in April that she planned to run to “ensure that there is a voice for the constitution and for the rule of law to preserve that in the state of Wisconsin.” “The overwhelming support for Judge Taylor early in this race shows how committed Wisconsinites are to reinforcing the majority on the court and electing a justice who will protect their rights and freedoms,” Taylor campaign manager Ashley Franz said in a statement. “Judge Taylor's broad base of support reflects her commitment to serving all Wisconsinites and ensuring our courts remain fair and independent.” Bradley was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by then-Gov. Justice-elect Susan Crawford and her conservative opponent, Brad Schimel, raised a combined $100 million. Crawford's win means liberal-leaning justices will retain control of the high court until at least 2028. Liberal-leaning candidates have won four of the last five Wisconsin Supreme Court elections by double-digit margins. If conservatives lose Bradley's seat next year, the court's 4-3 liberal majority will grow to 5-2. The election, which is technically nonpartisan, will take place on April 7, 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's growing concern for another significant rain and flooding event this week, this time along the Gulf Coast, from what could become the Atlantic basin's next tropical system. The potential storm's flood threat is just the latest in what has been a summer full of deadly and devastating floods. Right now, the would-be storm is a broad area of showers and thunderstorms off the east coast of Florida. It will drift west across Florida Tuesday, raising the flood threat there, and into the Gulf by midweek where it has a medium chance of becoming a tropical depression, according to the National Hurricane Center. If it can muster a more defined center of circulation and strengthen further it would become Dexter, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season — a mark typically reached around mid-August. If it does form, it would do so just off the Gulf Coast — a reminder that storms are more likely to form in the warm, shallow water closer to land in July. Warm water acts like fuel for storms to form and strengthen and ocean surface temperatures are well above average where the system is expected to track. Conditions aren't looking favorable for a strong storm right now because this system will likely not have much time to mature over water and will also have to overcome hostile upper-level winds that can rip apart storms. Even if it isn't named, this system will bring tropical downpours to Florida and parts of the Gulf Coast over the next several days. There's a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain in parts of the Florida Peninsula including Tampa and Orlando Tuesday as the system taps into rich tropical moisture and enhances rainfall rates and the flood potential. Rainfall totals could range between 3 to 5 inches. Rain chances increase midweek across the north-central Gulf Coast, including Alabama, Mississippi and southeast Louisiana. A Level 2 of 4 threat for flooding rain is in place Thursday for southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans and parts of coastal Alabama and Mississippi. By Friday, the threat increases to a Level 3 of 4 for parts of Louisiana including Baton Rouge over fears that heavy rain could linger. Several inches of rain are possible in the worst-case scenarios. It's clear that heavy rain and flooding will threaten much of the north-central Gulf Coast, but exactly where and how much remain in question. It will all depend on how strong the system becomes, where it tracks and how fast it moves – questions that will become sorted in the next couple of days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two research analysts made waves last week when they called for a major shakeup at tech giant Apple. The analysts weren't suggesting a logo or product redesign. Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone of LightShed Partners, a New York-based technology, media and telecommunications research firm, are questioning whether Cook is still the right person to lead one of the world's most valuable companies amid concerns that it's fallen behind in AI — a technology that's already disrupting work, education and other facets of everyday life. Apple has already faced pressure to come up with a new hit product as sales of smartphones, Apple's biggest revenue driver, have slowed across the industry. Replacing Cook would be a high-stakes move for Apple; the company is already undergoing leadership changes elsewhere in the C-suite, and changing CEOs could further pull focus away from running Apple's core business. Cook is also widely supported by Apple's board and has “staying power akin to other captains of industry” such as Disney's Bob Iger and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, reports Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has long tracked Apple's business strategy. There's no evidence to indicate Cook is going anywhere soon. Shares of Apple (AAPL) have skyrocketed under Cook's tenure, during which he's also built other lucrative products after the iPhone's success — such as smartwatches, earbuds and digital services. To be sure, the LightShed note is just one take in a crowded field of analysts and researchers who follow Apple's business. But it is perhaps an indication that Apple's AI setbacks are bigger than a standard product delay — to some, they're shaking confidence in Apple's ability to innovate. They need a tech visionary,” said Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Apple has grappled with a litany of challenges so far in 2025, among them: President Donald Trump's tariff threats; fresh restrictions from the European Union on how it runs its valuable App Store; and a federal judge allowing an antitrust lawsuit alleging it has monopolized the smartphone market to proceed. But concerns about the iPhone maker's slow progress in AI have been front and center. The company in March said it's delaying a long-awaited update to Siri that would have enabled it to answer more complex questions with personalized answers and handle tasks on a user's behalf. That type of change would bring Siri closer to more modern AI agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. The company hasn't said much about when the revamped Siri will arrive aside from needing “more time to reach our high-quality bar,” Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said in June at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference. The concern is broader than Siri alone, it's that Apple doesn't seem to have much to show for its AI efforts so far, Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin told CNN earlier this year. Apple Intelligence, which arrived in 2024 following the iPhone 16's September launch, includes tools that can summarize notifications, transcribe phone calls, erase objects in photos, and use an iPhone's camera to search Google or prompt ChatGPT and create images. Although Apple delayed the Siri update, it did announce a batch of new AI features coming this fall, including live-language translation, AI-generated workout insights for the Apple Watch and enhancements to existing features. But many of these upgrades are Apple playing catch-up to tools already offered by other tech companies, and may not be enough to position Apple as a leader. “(Cook) has done a great job of getting Apple to where it is, but the environment certainly has changed,” said Thomas Martin, partner and senior portfolio manager at investment firm Globalt. Under Cook's watch, other high-profile products or projects have fallen short of expectations in recent years. But more than a year on, it remains a niche, novelty device as some of Apple's competitors are moving ahead with more stylish and practical augmented reality glasses. Also in 2024, Apple reportedly ended a decade-long effort to build an electric car, known internally as Project Titan, pulling the plug on what was believed to be an ambitious, expensive endeavor. Apple has made other significant changes to its leadership. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri was replaced at the start of 2025, although he remains vice president of corporate services according to Apple's website. Under Cook's leadership, Apple's market cap went from just over $342 billion in August 2011 to roughly $3 trillion today. Even the two LightShed Partners analysts have acknowledged that Cook has done “a great job.” “I don't think Apple would even consider doing that.” He added that while it's clear Apple isn't moving fast enough in AI, “getting rid of Tim Cook” may not be the answer. Instead, the company could address its AI challenges with an acquisition — the company has reportedly discussed buying AI startup Perplexity — or by deepening its partnership with OpenAI, or following in Meta's footsteps by investing more heavily in top talent, Zino said. It's rare for any company to keep a CEO for more than 10 years, says William Klepper, academic director in executive education at Columbia Business School and author of the book “The CEO's Boss: Tough Love in the Boardroom.” “And where they are now is in what I would call kind of a static state.” Keppler notes that the 10-year time frame isn't random. “From my research and my model, you need a change agent … because you got to start a second wave,” he said. Companies usually install new CEOs for three reasons: in response to a scandal, to fix a crisis or over a loss of trust and competence, says Sandra Sucher, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. None of those scenarios apply to Cook or Apple. But one thing's clear: Pressure is mounting on Apple to figure it out –— and fast. “Do we have an Intel-ing of Apple?” said Martin, referring to the once-leading American chipmaker that fell far behind rivals like Nvidia and AMD after missing several major technology waves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The response goes, over and over, like this: “FEMA is shifting from bloated, DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens … The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.” The Trump administration has been using this line for more than a month now, in response to criticism of its plans to remake, or perhaps disband, FEMA. And many people who study emergency response agree that, to some degree, the agency needs reform. And it is violating a basic precept of emergency management: Be prepared. In any disaster, responding quickly can help save people and salve the harm. An active disaster that killed more than 130 people, with more than 160 still missing, is not the occasion to switch up the norms. “This is exactly what many of us are concerned about,” Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Urban Institute, told me. However much FEMA might benefit from change, remaking it in an ad hoc fashion will just result in more devastation, he said: “In the context of a really complicated emergency where lots of people's lives are at stake—that's just not where you want to see experimentation happening.” And FEMA's response to the Texas flash-flood disaster has not been business as usual. Noem didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of urban-search-and-rescue teams—deployed in the past within hours during similar events—until more than 72 hours after the flooding had begun, per CNN reporting. FEMA had fewer than 100 people on the ground in Texas within four days of the disaster, and 311 by day five; within a week of Hurricane Helene, during what Donald Trump deemed a failed response to the flooding, FEMA deployed 1,500. “Like with any really catastrophic event, it's hard to understand what's happening at a micro level,” Rumbach said. No missing person has been found alive since last Friday. “It's clear that the initial response was much smaller and more measured than you would expect from FEMA,” Rumbach said. Due to vacancies, there is currently no FEMA regional administrator in any state along the Gulf Coast, just deputies. Right now, rather than “lean” and “deployable,” it might be more appropriate to describe FEMA as  “starved and hobbled.” But ostensibly, a FEMA-review council assembled by the Trump administration is meant to offer a plan to overhaul the agency. Noem has retained FEMA employees who looked like they'd be let go; Trump said last month that he intends to phase out FEMA only after this hurricane season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florida‘s attorney general speculated that weather modification technology could have played a role in the deadly Texas flash floods. On Monday, James Uthmeier wrote a letter to all public-use airports in the state, warning against any geoengineering or weather modification technology, which the state had recently banned. Most notable, however, was a line in the letter in which the Republican attorney general speculated that “cloud seeding” technology could have played a role in the Texas floods that have killed 132 people and left 101 missing. “Developing reports show that a weather modification company conducted ‘cloud seeding' operations just days before the deadly flood.” “Florida's new law seeks to prevent anything like that from ever happening,” he added. This morning, I sent a letter to all public-use airports in Florida addressing the state's new ban on weather modification.This landmark legislation marks another victory for health, freedom, and environmental protection in Florida.We expect full cooperation from our airports… pic.twitter.com/VyL6FQjSuh Uthmeier referred to concerns over a 20-minute cloud seeding mission by Rainmaker Technology Corporation on July 2 over Karnes County, southeast of the flood zone. Two clouds were targeted and dissipated later that day. “Natural clouds typically have lifespans of 30 minutes to a few hours at most, with even the most persistent storm systems rarely maintaining the same cloud structure for more than 12-18 hours. Doricko also released a detailed meteorological report around the mission. I encourage the meteorology community to ask questions and scrutinize our claims, and we will continue to be fully transparent in answering.Attached is a meteorological report on the events. Veteran Houston meteorologist Travis Herzog with ABC 13 argued against the theory, arguing that there was no scientific evidence for it. He pointed out that floods of the July 4 type are rare but had ample precedent long before cloud seeding technology was created. “Due to the hilly terrain, when high amounts of rain fall in a short period of time, the water flows quickly through the creek and river valleys, sometimes with devastating and deadly consequences like we are witnessing on this July 4th holiday weekend. “Cloud seeding cannot create a storm of this magnitude or size. “All it can do is take an existing cloud and enhance the rainfall by up to 20%, and even that is on the high end.” If I blow out a candle with my breath, does that mean I can then go blow out a raging wildfire?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal workers warned for months that the high-energy biscuits would go to waste. This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Five months into its unprecedented dismantling of foreign-aid programs, the Trump administration has given the order to incinerate food instead of sending it to people abroad who need it. Within weeks, two of those sources told me, the food, meant for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, will be ash. Since January, when the Trump administration issued an executive order that halted virtually all American foreign assistance, federal workers have sent the new political leaders of USAID repeated requests to ship the biscuits while they were useful, according to the two USAID employees. But since Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency disbanded USAID and the State Department subsumed the agency, no money or aid items can move without the approval of the new heads of American foreign assistance, several current and former USAID employees told me. From January to mid-April, the responsibility rested with Pete Marocco, who worked across multiple agencies during the first Trump administration; then it passed to Jeremy Lewin, a law-school graduate in his 20s who was originally installed by DOGE and now has appointments at both USAID and State. Two of the USAID employees told me that staffers who sent the memos requesting approval to move the food never got a response and did not know whether Marocco or Lewin ever received them. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told representatives on the House Appropriations Committee that he would ensure that food aid would reach its intended recipients before spoiling. Rubio has insisted that the administration embraces America's responsibility to continue saving foreign lives, including through food aid. But in April, according to NPR, the U.S. government eliminated all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Yemen, where, the State Department said at the time, providing food risks benefiting terrorists. (The State Department has offered no similar justification for pulling aid to Pakistan.) Instead, the biscuits in the Dubai warehouse continue to approach their expiration date, after which their vitamin and fat content will begin to deteriorate rapidly. At this point, United Arab Emirates policy prevents the biscuits from even being repurposed as animal feed. One current USAID staffer told me he'd never seen anywhere near this many biscuits trashed over his decades working in American foreign aid. But several of the aid workers I spoke with reiterated that they have never before seen the U.S. government simply give up on food that could have been put to good use. The emergency biscuits slated for destruction represent only a small fraction of America's typical annual investment in food aid. In fiscal year 2023, USAID purchased more than 1 million metric tons of food from U.S. producers. Typically, the biscuits are the first thing that World Food Programme workers hand to Afghan families who are being forced out of Pakistan and back to their home country, which has been plagued by severe child malnutrition for years. The WFP projects that, globally, 58 million people are at risk for extreme hunger or starvation because this year, it lacks the money to feed them. Based on calculations from one of the current USAID employees I spoke with, the food marked for destruction could have met the nutritional needs of every child facing acute food insecurity in Gaza for a week. Despite the administration's repeated promises to continue food aid, and Rubio's testimony that he would not allow existing food to go to waste, even more food could soon expire. According to USAID inventory lists from January, more than 60,000 metric tons of food—much of it grown in America, and all already purchased by the U.S. government—were then sitting in warehouses across the world. A former senior official at USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance told me that, by the time she'd left her job earlier this month, very little of the food seemed to have moved; one of the current USAID employees I spoke with confirmed her impression, though he noted that, in recent weeks, small shipments have begun leaving the Djibouti warehouse. Read: ‘In three months, half of them will be dead' Such operations are more difficult for USAID to manage today than they were last year because many of the humanitarian workers and supply-chain experts who once coordinated the movement of American-grown food to hungry people around the world no longer have their jobs. (A State Department spokesperson told me that the department had recently approved additional purchases, but both CEOs told me they have yet to receive the orders. The State Department has not responded to further questions about these purchases.)</p>
