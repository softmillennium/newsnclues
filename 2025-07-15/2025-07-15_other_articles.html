                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has implored people to stop talking about Jeffrey Epstein. Trump and many in his administration are now facing the wrath of the more conspiracy theory-minded people whom they counted among their most ardent supporters, sparked by the Department of Justice and Trump's own pleas for people to stop asking questions about Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose name has become synonymous with a broader distrust of the government and the media. “One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it's the 'HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World,” Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social. Data from Google showed that searches for Epstein spiked after Trump's post. The fallout, which started in early June and ramped up over the weekend, has even hit some of Trump's most loyal spaces. Trump's Truth Social post has received more than 45,000 responses, far more than other recent posts, with many of the top comments expressing frustration with the president. “This statement breaks my heart, Mr. President,” one commenter wrote. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide, but conspiracy theories claiming that “Epstein didn't kill himself” began to spread almost immediately in the aftermath. Trump has used conspiracy theories for political gain since before he ran for president, when he stoked false claims that Barack Obama's birth certificate was fake. Since then, he and his supporters have embraced or at least entertained a wide variety of outlandish claims, with many centering on child abuse. During his most recent presidential campaign, Trump said he would have “no problem” looking into an Epstein client list — a list that some people believe exists and that contains the names of powerful clients of Epstein's. Trump further leaned into the conspiracy mindset, appointing to senior positions people who have similarly used conspiracy theories to make broad accusations of corruption and abuse, most notably FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. “Nobody exploited those questions more than Donald Trump,” said Russell Muirhead, a professor at Dartmouth College who has written on the online intersection of conspiracy theories and politics. Joseph Uscinski, a political science professor at the University of Miami who has written extensively on conspiracy theories, stressed that claims of shadowy groups of elites abusing children have been around for millennia, with the Epstein theories only a more recent and high-profile example. Public interest in all things Epstein has remained high since last week, when Axios first reported that a two-page memo from the Justice Department featured a conclusion that an “exhaustive review” of materials related to Epstein found no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list'” or evidence for prosecuting other people connected to him. It also confirmed that Epstein had died by suicide. The memo inspired a large amount of backlash from Trump's supporters, which led to exhortations from Trump supporting Attorney General Pam Bondi and questioning the continued interest in Epstein — backlash that was only further exacerbated by Trump's Truth Social post. Together, the combination has led to a sustained viral commotion over the last week that has been nearly inescapable online, from Reddit and YouTube to X and even Trump's own Truth Social. Clips from that event, with people openly questioning the administration's credibility, also spread across social media. In a live taping of Steve Bannon's War Room podcast at the conference, one attendee told Trump's former campaign CEO and senior counselor that he believed “now Trump has become the deep state,” saying, “What is more deep state than covering up for pedophiles?” Uscinski noted that Trump and officials in his administration did not do themselves any favors by fanning the flames around Epstein, particularly around Epstein's death, only to now be told to stop talking about it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having covered several administrations, I know from my own experience that there's one common complaint among White House reporters, no matter who is president: Lack of access. He'll stop and take questions anywhere, anytime, on any topic. As we discovered last week, he'll take questions on any topic but one. “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?” Trump exploded to a reporter who asked about Epstein at a July 8 Cabinet meeting. Trump doesn't want to talk about Epstein for a couple of reasons. Trump's problem is that it's not Democrats who are talking about Epstein but his MAGA base, who are angry at the way they believe Trump has sold out on the Epstein scandal. Trump begged MAGA supporters not to waste any more time on Epstein. He's even tried to blame it all on Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. But many of his MAGA supporters aren't buying it. Because, ever since his apparent suicide in a federal prison cell in August 2019, MAGA commentators, with Trump's blessing, whipped up a conspiracy that the Biden Justice Department was lying about Epstein's suicide and covering up his client list to protect the “elites” who allegedly took part in Epstein's sexual depravity — and promised that, under a Trump Department of Justice, the sordid Epstein files would be released. “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?” he asked in 2023. And, after Bondi told Fox News in February that the Epstein list was “sitting on my desk right now,” the Justice Department and FBI released a joint statement that contradicted everything Patel, Bongino and others had claimed for years: There is, in fact, no evidence that Epstein was murdered or kept a client list. That abrupt reversal, attempting to bury the whole Epstein matter, has inflamed the president's MAGA base against Bondi and Trump himself. In effect, they now accuse him of selling out and demand Bondi's resignation. It was the main topic of conversation at last weekend's conservative Student Action Summit in Tampa. “I don't think they're telling us the truth about Epstein,” podcaster Brandon Tatum told the assembled crowd of 7,000 student activists. Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly asked the crowd a simple question: “Who do you believe? Former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon accused Trump of not being as “transparent” as he promised and urged him to name a special counsel to take over the Epstein case. And, in a post, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn warned Trump: “Please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away.” But Trump and others did such a good job of selling MAGA leaders the lies about Epstein that it's now impossible to sell them the truth. This split in the MAGA world is entirely of Trump's own making. Starting with the Obama birther movement, Trump has long thrived on conspiracy theories. If there's a lesson to be learned, it's this: Be careful of the monsters you create with your conspiracy theories, because they might come back to haunt you — which is exactly what Epstein is doing to Trump now.

At first, I thought it might be a cluster of balloons or maybe a drone, but it felt too big and still for either. The object remained completely motionless for about 5 seconds, and then — without warning — it disappeared. It didn't drift away, fly off, or shrink into the distance. I have accumulated hours of experience around drones from personally operating drones to watching and learning from others operating. This was something much larger than a standard drone that me, you, or the neighbor could get ahold of. It didn't behave like anything I've seen before, and I haven't been able to come up with a solid explanation since. I've honestly never really looked into UFO's or drones prior to last Saturday. I knew the pentagon released information confirming an influx of drones/unidentifiable flying objects from social media but now I can't stop looking into all of the facts that we as humans know - specifically information coming from renowned scientists, the US military, government, and prior individuals in authority.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trailer of JP Thuminad's Kannada film 'Su From So' was released on July 15. 'Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana' fame Raj B Shetty is presenting the film under his banner Lighter Buddha Films. The film is a supernatural comedy drama set in a village backdrop, showcasing the vibrant life of the villagers—until one day, the devil arrives. Set in the coastal Mangaluru–Udupi region of Karnataka, the trailer carries the essence of 'Kantara' and 'Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana', particularly through its dialect and depiction of local life. The peaceful lives of the villagers take a chilling but comedic turn when Sulochana from Someshwar (Su from Sa) starts haunting them. What follows is a hilarious chain of events that flips the entire village upside down. 'Su From So' stars Shaneel Gautham, JP Thuminad, Sandhya Arakere, Prakash K Thuminadu, Deepak Rai Panaje and Mime Ramdas, all of whom are familiar to audiences for their appearances in films helmed by Raj B Shetty, Rishab Shetty or Rakshit Shetty. The music for the film has been composed by Sumedh K, and one of its songs, 'Danks Anthem', has gone viral on social media. The film has been produced by Shashidhar Shetty Baroda, Ravi Rai Kalasa and Raj B Shetty. 'Su From So' is scheduled to release in theatres on July 25, 2025.- EndsPublished By: Sanjay Ponnappa CSPublished On: Jul 15, 2025ALSO READ |  KD teaser: Sanjay Dutt, Dhruva Sarja promise action-packed commercial entertainerMust Watch:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A psychic has detailed what it's like to 'die' after claiming to have experienced the feeling four times. Amie Balesky, a spiritual medium with more than three million followers on TikTok, claims to have been 'helping spirits and people since 1995' and has taken to her social media account to share her latest near-death experience, which she says occurred due to a brain infection. At the time she 'passed over', Balesky was on the operating table with doctors and nurses 'freaking out' trying to keep her alive during a dangerous procedure on her spine - which put her body into a state of shock. "I stopped caring about what was going on around me and the feelings I had were more 'in'," she explained to her huge following on TikTok, noting that the room was getting quieter, despite all the commotion continuing. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, without any feeling, transition or anything like that, I notice that my vision or what I was seeing [was] beginning to drift to a different perspective - it was drifting up. All I could feel was love. "So I only thought of two things. I could see everybody and [had] no pain. The next thing she experienced was that she awoke two weeks later in a hospital room, and was told that she had died. "So for me, the transition was beautiful. For me, it was peaceful - didn't even recognize that it was happening, and all my pain, anxiety, worries, all of that was gone simply in one breath," she continued. The American, who goes by '@TheBalesky' on TikTok, explained that 'when you cross over' you're either met with one of your loved ones or a guy - although she didn't go into detail about whether that said person was Jesus, which many people have underwent similar experiences believe they have met. Having had four near-death experiences, which she believes is the reason why her 'superpower' is so 'charged', she has urged people not to fear dying as it is as benign as stubbing your toe. "Being worried about what it's going to feel like to pass is the equivalent of being worried about if you're going to stub your toe on the coffee table again - it's going to happen, it may hurt just a second, but as soon as it's there, it's gone," Balesky explained.

Because a planet's size is a critical component in most models predicting potential exoplanet habitability, UCI doctoral student and study lead author Te Han believes the team's findings could eliminate several candidate exoplanets previously considered favorable places for astrobiologists to search for extraterrestrial life. “We found that hundreds of exoplanets are larger than they appear, and that shifts our understanding of exoplanets on a large scale,” Han explained in a statement. Since 1995, when scientists discovered the first planet outside of Earth's solar system, newer and more powerful observation tools have increased the confirmed list of exoplanets to over 5,000. Although researchers have employed several techniques to make those discoveries, most discoveries involve measuring the dip in a star's light as an exoplanet passes between it and Earth. Along with determining an exoplanet's likely orbit, mass, and density, the TESS data helps scientists estimate its size. Having confirmed the interstellar contamination, Han and colleagues reexamined hundreds of previous TESS exoplanet discoveries. “TESS data are contaminated, which Te's custom model corrects better than anyone else in the field,” Robertson explained. In their study, Han, Robertson, and colleagues explain how correcting for this interstellar contamination has led to significant changes in the characteristics of the exoplanets they studied. “It raises the question: Just how common are Earth-sized planets?” Robertson asks. After correcting for interstellar contamination, “all of them are actually bigger than we thought.” For example, although some scientists have begun to rethink what form life outside Earth might take, most models still favor looking for places that can support liquid water, are rocky like Earth, and have a relatively similar size. If Han's new model is correct and many planets we initially thought were Earth-like are much larger, they may not be rocky at all. Instead, they may be theoretical ‘water worlds' covered by one giant ocean. They may also be gaseous planets like Neptune and Uranus. Scientists Develop Infrared Contacts That Enable Sci-Fi-Style Night Vision—Even With Eyes Closed Hoping to add to the potentially habitable exoplanet list instead of taking away from it, Han and his team plan to reexamine TESS data for candidates that were previously dismissed but now may be viable candidates for extraterrestrial life due to the inclusion of interstellar contamination in their size and composition estimates. The team also wants to let other exoplanet researchers know about the interstellar contamination phenomenon so they can correct for it in their transit models.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dan Rivera, 54, the lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research and a U.S. Army veteran, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, July 13, 2025, during his visit to Gettysburg, the society announced on Monday evening. Adams County dispatch scanner archives show that firefighters and medical personnel had been called to a hotel in Gettysburg on Sunday evening for a report of CPR in progress on a male patient of Rivera's age. Rivera had helped bring the tour to international attention through his public outreach, including numerous viral TikTok videos that Rivera produced with paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell that racked up millions of views as the doll was taken across the country. The tour had garnered extensive publicity in recent months, even sparking outrage in several locations as many took to social media over superstitions regarding the doll's storied past. In the hours that followed the announcement of Rivera's death on Monday evening, an outpouring of tributes and memorials to Rivera began to pop up across the paranormal community, remembering Rivera for his passion for sharing the paranormal and as a caring husband, father and friend. That case, Rivera told the group, he built with three crosses, representing the holy trinity, and is stained in a finish that contained holy water. In his remarks, Rivera joked that "we did not burn down that plantation," and "we did not free those prisoners," referencing some of the viral instances that social media had attempted to tie to the doll's journey. Later in the tour, Rivera added that Annabelle had not caused a 911 outage that sent wireless emergency alerts blaring across cellphones Pennsylvania, including inside of the first showings of the doll a day prior. Speaking of his late mentor, Rivera shared with the audience that her guidance for protecting oneself from "evil spirits" entailed almost a form of meditation. "What Lorraine would say to protect yourself," said Rivera, "is to close your eyes and envision yourself in a halo of white light." Biographies for Rivera described an "insatiable curiosity" about the paranormal from a young age that led to Rivera founding his own paranormal investigation group after his service in the U.S. Army. That curiosity also led Rivera to attend lectures from Lorraine Warren, where biographies said Warren had taken Rivera under her wing and mentored him in the last years of her life, eventually leading to his appointment as the lead investigator for NESPR in 2011. NESPR was founded in 1952 by Ed and Lorraine Warren, who were known for their paranormal investigations of "The Amityville Horror" house on Long Island, the "Enfield Poltergeist," and the Annabelle doll. After Ed Warren's passing in 2006, then Lorraine's passing in 2019, NESPR and the Warrens' occult museum collection in Connecticut has been maintained by their daughter, Judy Spera, and their son-in-law, Tony Spera. In a tribute to Rivera by Buell, Buell shared that Rivera had cared extensively for Lorraine near the end of her life. "He devoted his time, passionately, to keeping Ed and Lorraine's legacy alive," Buell wrote in the post. Buell, who worked with Rivera on the tour, noted Rivera's success in helping continue the Warrens' story in recent years through organizing the paranormal convention ParaCon, which visited Gettysburg in 2024, as well as the Annabelle tour, which Buell said had "introduced a whole new generation to Ed and Lorraine Warren's legacy." Rivera's work involving the paranormal extended beyond publicity, according to the post, including what Buell said was private work that Rivera and NESPR undertook to assist families that were allegedly haunted. "Just as Ed and Lorraine did," Buell noted. The news of Rivera's passing quickly spread among those involved in the tour and through social media on Monday night. "Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal," Gilloren wrote. "His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him." "We are heartbroken and still processing this loss," Gilloren said in the statement from himself, fellow NESPR investigator Wade Kirby, and Spera. "Thank you for your support and kind thoughts during this difficult time." Mary Jo Chudley, of Penn Paranormal in Bucks County, had been among those who participated in the event on Saturday, and shared a tribute to the group's extensive social media following. "He was one of the kindest, most genuine and funniest guys I've ever known." As the news circulated around various paranormal communities, some resurfaced a 2020 post from Rivera that was made in tribute to his own personal mentor, Lorraine, on the anniversary of her passing. "My answer was, in life, we leave a piece of ourselves with loved ones and friends on our journey through life until there are no more pieces to give away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many such stories have emerged from his hometown since the 1800s, which is why the short film was selected to lead off the 51st annual AuroraFest village celebration, whose theme was "mystical lake creatures." Torres, who now lives in Los Angeles, joined the screening to answer questions via Zoom. While local and national audiences have been familiar with the mystery films of Torres for decades, in recent years his work has been seen in much greater numbers thanks to "Unsolved Mysteries" on Netflix. In the wake of that success, and his screening of "Firefly Marsh" in Aurora, The Citizen caught up with Torres to talk more about his past, present and future projects. A depiction of the Mothman —  a cryptid that some believe lives in Point Pleasant, West Virginia —  on the set of Gabe Torres' "Unsolved Mysteries." It's familiar territory after "Unsolved Mysteries," for which Torres directed five episodes in 2022 and 2024. “One day they called and asked if I wanted to do it again,” he told The Citizen. “They said, 'We're bringing it to a new generation, and upping the production value. Torres' episodes cover some well-known topics, such as Bigfoot's West Virginian cousin, the Mothman, and the discovery of what some believe to be UFO debris in Roswell, New Mexico. It covers the story of a bloody, unsolved murder in Calgary — a true story that Torres, holding his tongue to prevent spoilers, said is unraveled in reverse order. To Torres, that pair of episodes was a welcome break from business as usual in modern television, reminding him of when he was first starting decades ago. Torres said he's appreciative the series gave him the chance to direct mysteries again, and hopes it finds a home somewhere else. “To bring something to an audience where no one knows what happens — that's much more gratifying, and much more fun,” he said. Gabe Torres, right, on the set of Netflix's "Unsolved Mysteries" alongside members of the production crew in Calgary, Canada. While Torres likes making documentaries, he called it his “day job.” He just finished the script for one of them, a horror film called “Dragon Fall,” and is now looking for a teenage lead actor who can help sell it. The other, “Nothing to Lose,” has already been picked up by production company Dolphin Entertainment and is set to begin shooting in Nashville after it casts its lead actors. Torres' passion for filmmaking started young, at age 12. After watching films like “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” he became fascinated with how they looked. and, ‘How did they make it look like that? He lucked into finding a Kodak Super 8 film camera at his neighbor's house and set out making disaster shorts, like sinking ships and collapsing dams. “It wasn't until my senior year that I focused on stories rather than special effects,” Torres said, “and that's where my passion lies now.” As Torres continues to add new projects and credits to his resume, people still contact him about "Firefly Marsh" as well. Just last month, he said, a fan from the United Kingdom who used to watch it on the Disney Channel reached out in hopes of getting a copy, which Torres provided. “It's always great to have your work, that you pour so much into, get recognized.” A lot has changed in Hollywood since Torres got his start, like the meteoric rise of streaming. But he still clings to old-school habits — all his scripts find life on yellow legal pads, and physical copies of films and vinyl soundtracks still line his shelves. He'll also never stop tapping into the childhood magic that made films so special for him growing up. “I think 'Firefly Marsh' is a throwback to the magic of childhood, when you believe in myths and in monsters,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists are looking down at the alien-looking creatures on the bottom of Earth's deep sea to figure out what kind of extraterrestrial life may exist up in space. There are some candidate moons and planets within our own solar system which could harbour such life. Finding extraterrestrial life within our own solar system would suggest that, not only are we not alone, but the universe is likely to be teeming with inhabited worlds. One candidate for extraterrestrial life is Europa, Jupiter's fourth largest moon. But it is one of at least 3 Jovian moons which astronomers believe could have salty oceans of liquid water beneath its icy exterior. NASA observations suggest that Europa's icy crust could be 15–25km thick. One more ingredient would make Europa habitable: if the moon has a hot, molten core which supplies the ocean floor with heat and crucial minerals. “We think, based on our own planet, that Europa may have conditions that can support life,” says James Holden, a microbiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US. He believes that the hydrothermal vents thousands of metres beneath the surface are prime sites to study what life on other worlds might be like. “To get our microbes from them, we use submarines – sometimes human-occupied, sometimes robotic – to dive a mile below the surface and bring the samples ashore and back into my lab.” “Because Europa's conditions might be similar to the conditions these microbes come from, we think that Europan life, if it exists, should look something like our own hydrothermal microbes,” Holden explains. On Earth, deep-sea microbes produce energy by breaking down hydrogen from the hydrothermal vents using enzymes called hydrogenases. Holden's team will use their understanding of Earth's deep-sea microbes to try and understand how microbes on a world with different chemistry would live. NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft launched in October 2024 and is on a 5-year mission to provide new observations of Jupiter's moon which could, along with insights from Holden's Earth-based studies, provide evidence that there is life on Europa.
