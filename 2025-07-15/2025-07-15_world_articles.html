                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The protesters tore through the city chanting angry slogans and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake: shattered glass, broken doors and furious graffiti – “get out of Mexico.” Some, dressed in black, smashed windows of local businesses. The march, which took place in central Mexico City earlier this month, was an angry local response against a growing global phenomenon: Gentrification, which locals blame on foreigners who have flocked to the capital since the coronavirus pandemic. Residents of the capital say these so-called ‘digital nomads' are taking advantage of Mexico's relatively cheap living standards but pricing out locals in the process. Making matters worse: a flood of Airbnbs have overtaken the metropolis' most desirable, central neighborhoods (more than 26,000 listings according to the Inside Airbnb advocacy group), replacing longtime residents with tourists and short-term renters. It is a trend that's been echoed around the world, in cites like Barcelona, Genoa and Lisbon, where tourist apartments have proliferated, turning long-term residents into a rarity and causing anger among locals who have seen their communities eroded. “The xenophobic displays at this demonstration must be condemned,” she said during a daily news conference last week. “No matter how legitimate the demand, in this case gentrification, we can't just say ‘Out!' But many Mexicans were sympathetic to the marchers' anger. Watching the protest play out on social media from his mother's home in the nearby city of Puebla, where he was forced to move after being priced out of Mexico City, Daniel Benavides says all he could think was: “Hell yeah!” Unlike the already trendy Roma Norte and Condesa, Roma Sur still felt like a quiet neighborhood, without the hip bars, restaurants and Airbnbs that had flooded other areas. “They all had little incandescent lightbulbs held up by rope,” he said. Benavides also started to notice an influx of foreigners, mostly Americans. Soon, the rent for his apartment started to go up. Such an increase is relatively modest, particularly by Mexico City standards. Cecilia Portillo, a 30-year-old designer, has lived in Condesa for three years. Recently, she told her landlady that she was moving out, but that a friend was ready to take her place. “The rent is going to go up by 50%,” said the landlady, according to Portillo, who has also watched a flood of foreigners arrive in her building. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2024 found that, over a 20 year period, average housing prices in the Mexican capital had quadrupled, without considering inflation. In the swanky neighborhood of Polanco, prices increased eightfold between 2000 and 2018. Instead, the study suggested that “displacement and gentrification predominantly originate from government policies and politics.” According to Mexico's national statistics agency, Mexico City had the lowest rate of new housing built between 2010 and 2020 of any state in the country. “If there is no housing, then the purchasing power of those few people [who can afford to live in desirable areas], whether it be a foreigner or an upper-class Mexican, will obviously push up the price of the few homes that are available.” The lack of new housing, and the resulting surge in prices, leaves many lower-income residents with nowhere to go: According to state figures, 23,000 families leave Mexico per year. In 2022, Benavides' landlord announced that he had sold the apartment to a French woman: Benavides and his roommates would have to move out. Benavides decided to move out but suddenly found that rental prices in his neighborhood had skyrocketed up to 25, 35, 40 even 100,000 pesos a month. “I pushed the emergency eject button,” he said woefully, adding that, particularly as a gay man, he still misses the capital.</p>

LONDON, July 15. /TASS/. Melania Trump could have significantly influenced US President Donald Trump's decision to supply Ukraine with interceptor missiles for Patriot complexes, The Times quoted Mary Jordan, who authored a book about the first lady, as saying.

"Trump listens to certain people on certain things," says Jordan. "He particularly listens to people who are really close to him. And especially if their last name is Trump."

As The Times points out, despite the large number of national security advisers and foreign policy analysts in the White House, it is the wife of the US president whose opinion may be the most significant.

On July 14, Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev, if Europe would pay for such supplies. Coordination was laid on NATO.

CNN reported that besides the Patriot complexes, the United States may also transfer short-range missiles and howitzer ammunition to NATO countries for a subsequent shipment to Ukraine.</p>

When movement is restricted and ambulances are scarce, the smallest wound can become a death sentence in Gaza. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! On a late March morning in 2024 in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, 24-year-old Yasmin Siam felt sharp pain grip her stomach. Ambulances had become rare after months of Israeli attacks — too few to answer every cry for help. Airstrikes were ongoing, and Gaza had fallen into total immobility. And ambulances, often targeted, had mostly been destroyed or left in flames. With no other option, Siam's family placed her on a donkey cart — the only remaining form of “transportation” in a time where movement itself had died. The journey to Nasser Hospital, which should have taken 20 minutes, took over an hour due to the wreckage, craters, and collapsed roads across Khan Younis. By the time she arrived, Siam was bleeding dangerously. But then came the words that shattered her: “Your baby didn't make it.” The child did not die because of war wounds, but because movement throughout Gaza has been decimated. Yasmin Siam's heartbreaking story is just one of many amid the widespread crisis gripping Gaza's transportation system. During the temporary ceasefire that lasted about 60 days — from late November 2023 until the end of January 2024 — the displaced residents of northern Gaza, who had fled south and remained trapped far from their destroyed homes for over a year, began to return north. But Palestinians couldn't wait; fear of the war restarting consumed them. So, many returned on foot, walking more than 30 kilometers. We search for it in far-off places, then carry it home through harsh, punishing paths. Among them was the family of my uncle Iyad, who had fled to Khan Younis. He told me the story of an elderly man, about 80 years old, who suddenly collapsed while walking — dying on his way back home. The story was heartbreaking, but I felt that the very attempt to return gave him a small measure of joy after a year of sorrow. For this man, returning home was a dream. But the most painful story — the one I witnessed with my own eyes and will never forget — happened during the ground siege imposed by Israeli forces in February 2024. During those terrifying days, we sealed every window shut. Any sign of life could bring death to everyone in the neighborhood. Outside, I saw him — a young man who had been riding his bicycle. A tank had fired on him, and he was struck in the shoulder. It wasn't a fatal injury. He was lying directly beneath my home, crying out, asking for water. I knew that stepping outside meant death. But in my heart, I also knew: during the siege, no ambulances ever came. Even the smallest wound became a death sentence. He kept bleeding for hours, his voice growing weaker… until it vanished. Three days later, after the Israeli army withdrew, neighbors found his body and buried him in the yard of Al-Qahira School in Al-Rimal. There were no proper burials anymore. There was no transport left to reach them. Schoolyards and hospital courtyards are now our mass graves. The suffering caused by the absence of transportation doesn't stop — it continues in countless forms. When aid is distributed, it's often near the Netzarim checkpoint, the dividing line between northern and southern Gaza. People from both sides walk more than 15 kilometers just to reach it — on foot. Imagine someone walking 15 kilometers to reach the aid, then another 15 kilometers back — and often returning with nothing. He has lost over 20 kilograms — not just because of the lack of food, but from the endless walking. When basic supplies become available, he walks and walks to get them and comes back utterly exhausted. The ones who carry heavy water containers on their backs because there is no transport to help them? We search for it in far-off places, then carry it home through harsh, punishing paths. What we suffer from today is beyond words — even donkey carts are vanishing. The horse-drawn carts disappeared long ago, most of them targeted and destroyed, as if no form of movement should be left to us. The few donkeys that survived are now dying slowly from hunger. Seeing a living animal on Gaza's streets has become rare. On June 28, 2025, I saw it with my own eyes: A donkey had collapsed on the road, too weak to stand, while its owner struggled helplessly to lift it. He tried everything — pulling, calling, pleading — but nothing worked. If even our last means of transport collapses in the street, what hope is left for the humans who still need to run? If even our last means of transport collapses in the street, what hope is left for the humans who still need to run? Imagine a father running down a silent street in Gaza, his child bleeding in his arms. “We'll get to the hospital.” But there are no cars. All that remains are tents — and exhausted bodies slowly dying, silently, in all the ways Gaza teaches us to die.

One week after the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document stating that there was never a Jeffrey Epstein “client list” — a supposed list of child sex predators and traffickers that is the center of a conspiracy theory that right-wingers have promoted for years — President Donald Trump, who benefited from that conspiracy theory, has expressed frustration that his MAGA base isn't moving on. Believers in the Epstein “client list” conspiracy theory allege that Epstein, a financier and former friend of Trump's, used the list as political leverage against public figures, including liberal and left-leaning individuals. Members of Trump's own administration, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, played a role in spreading the theory prior to assuming their posts. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. “I'd certainly take a look at it,” Trump said in regards to releasing the files relating to Epstein, adding that he'd be “inclined” to release such a list and would have “no problem” with doing so. Earlier this month, however, the DOJ announced that there is no Epstein “client list,” that there was “no credible evidence” of a blackmail conspiracy, and that Epstein indeed died by suicide while in jail, contradicting years of questions regarding the official narrative that Trump had benefited from. The document is also a stark departure from what Bondi had stated earlier this year. In an interview in February, when asked if an Epstein list would be released, Bondi responded affirmatively, saying it was on her desk waiting for review. Some of Trump's allies in Congress, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), have also expressed skepticism over the administration's new line. “I have to be honest, it's just a red line that it crosses for many people,” Greene said in an interview on Monday. The loyal MAGA base Trump relied on for so many years now appears to be “genuinely fractured,” read an assessment of the situation from Politico published this week. Days after the DOJ document was released, a reporter asked Bondi to comment during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Do you want to waste the time?” he asked. A few days later, Trump told his base it was time to move on. “We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Trump peddled a new conspiracy theory within that same post, baselessly claiming that several figures (including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and others) had written the Epstein files themselves in an effort to hurt him. Let's “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,” Trump added. The Democratic National Committee (DNC), for example, has created a new profile on X to remind viewers daily that the supposed Epstein list hasn't been released. Trump administration officials are either lying about the file and keeping it covered up to protect themselves, or they lied about its existence in a shameless political ploy to get elected. Either way, it is disgusting, and they have to be held accountable. Democratic lawmakers have also spoken out about the matter. “Either [Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there! “This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam Bondi and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several years, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.” The fracturing of Trump's MAGA base is somewhat evident in recent polls. According to a new Economist/YouGov poll published Tuesday morning, 79 percent of all U.S. voters want the Epstein files to be publicly released, including 83 percent of voters who backed Trump in 2024. Trump's approval rating among those who voted for him last year is still high, with 84 percent backing him and 13 percent disapproving.

India's Prime minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh, saying he was “extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness.” Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911. A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father's eyes. Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left all alone. He went to live with his youngest son in London. That's where sports enthusiast Singh attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community and took part in sprints. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Marathon. Singh ran his last competitive race in 2013 at the age of 101, finishing the Hong Kong Marathon's 10-kilometre (6.25-mile) race in 1 hour, 32 minutes, 28 seconds. Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped “people will remember me and not forget me.” He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events “rather than forget me altogether just because I don't run anymore.” “He was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination,” Modi said. My thoughts are with his family and countless admirers around the world.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

This general felt he was doing the right thing by them. There's a sense of obligation to them, as taxpaying citizens. You're a comedian with no Ukrainian heritage in your background. Former SCTV star Dave Thomas goes to Ukraine: ‘Most of my career is behind me, so why don't I go over there and see what I can do?' They're giving medical supplies and teaching field triage. They have evacuation teams that go behind enemy lines to rescue Ukrainian people who are trapped there, including women and children. On SCTV, you portrayed Bob Hope, famous for entertaining troops abroad. I wonder if he ever got shot at. But drones are the weapons of choice now. Ukrainian soldiers told me how difficult they are to shoot down. They're almost like those model airplanes hobbyists fly. I saw one Russian drone hanging in a bar. It doesn't look threatening at all, and yet they carry ordnance. The communications officer I mentioned lost his legs. He's still good from the legs up. What about the civilians you spoke with? I talked to a woman who was being evacuated from the south, near Odessa. Her husband was packing the car, and a Russian sniper shot him in the head. She saw it happen from the window of her house. Nobody should have to witness that. Did you speak with people about President Trump and U.S. support? They're very careful not to say anything negative about the United States. There's a Ukrainian phrase that translates to, ‘Everything will be fine.' I heard about drone strikes on a mall in Kyiv. Cardboard replaced the walls, and they were open for business as usual. I have to admit, I was mad at myself for being disappointed, because I brought my video crew to shoot the devastation and it was already under repair. They're dedicated to making things appear normal. You had plans to visit comedy clubs. I wanted to know what Ukrainians were laughing at. They want to laugh at normal things.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Singh's east London running club confirms death in India of athlete thought to be first centenarian to run a marathon The runner Fauja Singh, believed to be the oldest person to complete a marathon, has died in a road accident in India aged 114. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs in the City, confirmed his death and said its upcoming events in Ilford would be a celebration of his life and achievements. Singh's coach, Harmander Singh, wrote on Facebook: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm our icon of humanity and powerhouse of positivity Fauja Singh has passed away in India. Singh made his name by beating a number of records for marathon times in different age brackets. A profile on the Olympics website said Singh was born in Punjab, then under British rule, on 1 April 1911 and was the youngest of four children in a farming family. He moved to England and settled in east London with his son after the death of his wife, Gian Kaur, in Jalandhar. It was not until 2000, aged 89, that he took up running, quickly rising to fame by completing his maiden marathon in London in six hours and 54 minutes. Singh ran numerous marathons, completing the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon in five hours and 40 minutes, his personal best. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me. Her fellow Labour MP Jas Athwal, who represents Ilford South, said on X: “Deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Sardar Fauja Singh Ji. He was a global Sikh icon, that inspired millions across the world. “His spirit and legacy of resilience will run on forever. My heartfelt condolences to all his family and friends.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow will not be dictated to, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS, commenting on recent statements by US President Donald Trump. "Certainly, above all, we note that any attempts to put forth demands or, moreover, ultimatums, are unacceptable to us," the senior Russian diplomat pointed out. He emphasized that Moscow favors a diplomatic resolution of the Ukraine conflict and is ready to negotiate. "It is necessary to focus on political and diplomatic work. "However, if this is not met with a proper response, if we cannot reach our set goals through diplomacy, then the special military operation will go on," the Russian deputy foreign minister cautioned. Moscow is "unshakable" in this stance, he highlighted. "We would like for Washington and NATO in general to treat it with the utmost seriousness," Ryabkov said. In his assessment, Trump's recent statements "fit in with the general line we have been seeing from the US side lately." In the presence of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the US leader said that he was "disappointed" in Russia and its president as well as announced his decision to continue supplying weapons and military hardware to the Kiev regime if Europe foots the bill with NATO coordination. Additionally, Trump said that the US will impose about 100% import tariffs on Russia and its trade partners if within 50 days Moscow and Washington do not reach an agreement on the Ukrainian settlement.</p>

July 15 (Reuters) – A million more children completed the critical three-dose vaccination against diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to new data released by the World Health Organization. Despite the progress, drastic changes in funding, growing global conflicts, and rising vaccine misinformation threaten to further stall or even reverse progress which poses a threat. “We've hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult,” WHO's director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, Kate O'Brien, told reporters. In 2024, 89% of infants globally, about 115 million, received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, and roughly 109 million completed all three doses of the staple shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, also known as whooping cough, according to the new national immunization coverage data released on Tuesday by the WHO and UNICEF. But, nearly 20 million infants missed at least one dose of DTP-containing vaccine, which includes 14.3 million “zero-dose” children who never received a single dose of any vaccine. Data shows a quarter of the world's infants live in just 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict, or humanitarian crises, yet make up half of all unvaccinated children globally. Despite the challenges, countries have been able to scale up vaccines for diseases such as HPV, meningitis, pneumococcal disease, polio, and rotavirus. While this is far from the 90% coverage target by 2030, it represents a substantial increase from the 17% coverage in 2019. Global coverage against measles also improved, but the overall coverage rate is far below the 95% needed in every community to prevent outbreaks. “The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
