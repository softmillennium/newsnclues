France's top military officer falsely claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin labeled the country as Moscow's main adversary in Europe, French media have reported.

General Thierry Burkhard, France's chief of the defense staff, claimed on Friday that Russia considers France its “main adversary” on the continent, citing Paris' military support for Ukraine. “It was Putin who said this,” Burkhard declared to reporters.

Jean-Dominique Merchet of L'Opinion newspaper was among the first to challenge the claim. He said on social media that he had contacted the General Staff and was told Burkhard's remarks were a “turn of phrase” and were not based on an actual statement by the Russian leader.

Instead, the military referred to a Russian public opinion poll conducted by state pollster VTsIOM in April, which found that 45% of respondents viewed France as having tense or hostile relations with Russia – up sharply from previous years.

A separate survey by Russia's independent Levada Center in May showed Germany topping the list of countries perceived as hostile, with France not featuring among the top five. Only 32% of respondents named France as hostile in that poll.

Broadcaster TF1 also reported on Monday that it could find no record of Putin ever making such a statement.

Western officials and media have often been criticized for misquoting or oversimplifying Putin's statements, such as his 2005 remark describing the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century – frequently interpreted as a desire to restore the USSR.

Putin was describing the “drama of the Russian people” as many Russians found themselves living on foreign soil as ethnic minorities. In a 2010 interview, Putin clarified further: “Anyone who wants to rebuild [the USSR] has no head.”

France has advocated for stronger EU defense capabilities in recent years, while Moscow has accused the bloc of exaggerating a Russian threat to justify increased military spending.

China has blasted US plans to hit Russia's trade partners with steep secondary tariffs, calling the proposed 500% duties “illegal unilateral sanctions” that undermine efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict.

The rebuke follows legislation floated by hawkish senator Lindsey Graham, which if adopted would grant US President Donald Trump the authority to impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries that maintain trade with Russia. Graham singled out China, India, and Brazil, emphasizing that Trump would have “maximum flexibility” in applying the sanctions.

Responding to a question about the tariff threat, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Tuesday that Beijing “firmly opposes any illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.” He added, “There are no winners in a tariff war,” and reiterated that “dialogue and negotiation are the only viable way” to end the conflict.

Graham claimed the measure would give Trump a “sledgehammer” against Russia. Moscow has denounced the sanctions as illegal and accused Western nations of exploiting the Ukraine conflict to stifle its development.

The bill, however, has been put on hold as Senate Republican leader John Thune said on Monday that Trump could act unilaterally. The lawmaker was cited by Politico as saying it “sounds like… the president is going to attempt to do some of this on his own,” but if Trump later decides it would “add value and leverage” to his negotiations, “we'll be ready to go.”

Trump said on Monday that he was “very unhappy” with Russia and threatened tariffs of up to 100% on countries that continue trading with Moscow unless a deal to end the Ukraine conflict is reached within 50 days. He made the remarks during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office.

China has become Russia's top trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting a record $245 billion in 2024. Beijing has consistently opposed “unilateral” sanctions on Moscow and offered to mediate a ceasefire in Ukraine. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Moscow, vowing to deepen the two countries' “strategic partnership” and boost trade ties.

Germany has asked to purchase Typhon medium-range missile launchers from the US amid tensions with Russia over Ukraine, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said. Typhon deployments would have been banned under the now-defunct 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).

Pistorius confirmed on Monday that Berlin had sent Washington a formal request to buy the Typhon system, which can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles and SM-6 multi-role missiles. The Typhon has an operational range of around 2,000km and could reach targets far beyond Moscow if fired from German territory. 

The system would fill a capability gap until European countries produce their own long-range missiles, which could take between seven to ten years, Pistorius said.

However, he acknowledged uncertainty over whether the US remains committed to deploying long-range missiles to Germany from 2026, under a plan first announced in 2024 by the administration of former President Joe Biden. “I am very confident that last year's agreement is still valid, but we are still waiting for a final decision,” the minister said.

The announcement of the long-range missile deployment drew a sharp rebuke from Moscow, which warned that it would consider itself “free” from a unilateral moratorium on the deployment of similar missiles. 

Potential deployment of Typhon launchers and other long-range assets bears certain parallels to the highly contentious decision by NATO to deploy Pershing II nuclear-capable missiles with a range of more than 2,000km in West Germany in the 1980s. The move sparked massive protests across Europe and a new spiral of tensions between the Soviet Union and the US, ultimately leading to a détente and the signing of the INF Treaty.

Typhon launcher deployments would have been banned under the INF Treaty, in which the Soviet Union and the US agreed to eliminate all ground-based missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500km.

The pact collapsed in 2019 when Washington withdrew, citing Russian violations. Russia has denied the claims, accusing the US of developing the banned missiles. President Vladimir Putin has warned that the collapse of the INF will significantly erode the global security framework.

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. The Kremlin has taken note of US President Donald Trump's statement on Monday about military aid supplies to Kiev and will thoroughly analyze his rhetoric, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing.

""The latest statements from the US president are very serious. Something in them concerns President [Vladimir] Putin personally,"" Peskov said. ""We will certainly need time to analyze the rhetoric from Washington,"" he added.

On July 14, Trump revealed his statement on resolving the Ukraine conflict. At a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the US leader said he was ""disappointed"" with Russia and personally President Vladimir Putin. He also announced sending more US weapons and military aid to Kiev to be purchased by European nations with coordination from NATO.

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. The European Union has begun informal discussions on a 19th package of anti-Russian sanctions, Czech MEP Tomas Zdechovsky told Izvestia.

""Discussions on the 19th package are already underway, although they are at an early and informal stage. The main problem is sanctions fatigue - not political, but technical. After 18 packages, restrictions have already been imposed on most obvious targets. Now the focus is on tightening controls, expanding secondary restrictions, and clarifying export and import controls,"" Zdechovsky stated.

The 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions has not yet been agreed upon within the EU. Hungary and Slovakia continue to oppose the European Commission's plan to ban oil and gas supplies from Russia to the EU by early 2028.

On June 23, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that during a meeting of EU foreign ministers that day, he and his Slovak counterpart, Juraj Blanar, blocked the approval of the 18th package and demanded that Brussels' energy plan be removed from the agenda.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump lashes out at Moscow, and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky reshuffles his cabinet. Meanwhile, the EU is struggling to agree on an 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions. These stories topped newspaper headlines across Russia on Tuesday.

 

The latest US restrictions on Russia pledged by President Donald Trump in the event of a lack of progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict cannot harm the Russian economy: even 100% tariffs will be of no use amid a record low bilateral trade. As for more sanctions, most essential goods have long been manufactured in Russia or imported via countries not subject to US restrictions, the State Duma explained to Izvestia. Meanwhile, new weapons supplies, including Patriot systems, will not be a gamechanger on the battlefield. Experts doubt US-made Patriots are a superweapon and believe that most threats will likely remain mere rhetoric.

On Monday, the US leader voiced his claims against Russia and proposed both military and economic measures that he thinks should pressure Russia to end the Ukraine conflict. At a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on July 14, Trump announced sending more US weapons to be purchased by European nations. Among other weapons, the deal would see Kiev receive 17 Patriot batteries within the next few days.

""Strange that someone still views the notorious Patriot systems as superweapons, even as we have repeatedly destroyed these US [missile] systems in Ukraine, too, — our Kinzhal [missiles] pierce them easily. And the S-400 Triumf missile system is in service with our army, which has better tactical and technical characteristics than US systems,"" State Duma Deputy and First Deputy Chairman of the Defense Committee Alexey Zhuravlev told Izvestia.

According to him, Moscow may respond in kind to the US move, by sending the S-400 Triumf system to Iran, which has proven to need constant protection from Western missiles, or Yemen's Houthis who have learned to down US aerial targets using improvised weapons. ""I mean, it may take two to play this weapons supply game,"" the politician concluded.

Apart from military measures, Trump proposed increasing economic pressure on Russia as well, ""if we don't have a deal in 50 days."" He threatened ""tariffs at about 100%"" against Moscow and its trade partners.

Such lofty tariffs may look scary, but last year, trade between Russia and the United States amounted to some $3.5 billion — quite a small volume for both countries, Daniil Bolotskikh, an analyst with BCS World of Investments, noted. This is perhaps why Trump might have actually meant sanctions, not tariffs, he said. By the way, last year, Russia-US trade hit a record low since 1992, he added.

 

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko has been nominated for Prime Minister, Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel. Under Ukrainian laws, candidates for prime minister, nominated by the president, are appointed by the Verkhovna Rada.

Outgoing Prime Minister Denis Shmygal, who has led the government since March 2020, will become Ukraine's new defense minister, Zelensky announced a bit later, while current Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will become the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, media reported. Zelensky executed a similar reassignment earlier when he transferred former Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny to the position of ambassador to the United Kingdom.

On Monday, US Special Presidential Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on a week-long visit. On July 14, he met with Zelensky who wrote on his Telegram channel that the two sides discussed assistance to Ukrainian air defenses, the procurement of weapons by Europe, and anti-Russian sanctions.

Sviridenko's appointment has been pre-agreed with the West and completely suits Zelensky and the head of his office, Andrey Yermak, Ivan Skorikov, head of the Ukraine Department at the Institute of CIS Studies, told Vedomosti. The new PM is a technocrat politician who has no political ambitions whatsoever. So, the presidential office is recruiting `unambitious individuals' who cannot overshadow Zelensky. According to Skorikov, the cabinet reshuffle will be followed by a series of criminal cases against corrupt politicians implicated with schemes involving Western aid to Ukraine.

Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky, associate professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, says Sviridenko is a partner trusted by the West who, among other things, favors selling Ukrainian agricultural land to the Americans or lobbies for the interests of Western companies in Ukraine.

It looks like Kiev's cabinet shake-up is all about money and weapons, Alexander Malkevich, a member of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, commented to Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Zelensky will perhaps try to replace Zaluzhny, his election rival, too, and the leadership may as well oust current commander-in-chief Alexander Syrsky, a convenient person to be blamed for all failures on the front line. ""It looks like a series of reshuffles can take place here to facilitate the win of the pro-presidential party in a future election,"" the political analyst noted.

Meanwhile, media reported on Monday morning that Zelensky submitted bills to extend martial law and general mobilization for 90 days from August 7 as part of a 16th measure since the large-scale armed confrontation with Russia began in February 2022.

 

The European Union finds it increasingly difficult to impose new sanctions on Russia. This time around, Brussels failed to agree on another package of restrictions because of Malta, Politico reported. Maltese officials resisted the proposal put forward by the European Commission to set an oil price cap on Russian oil exports at 15% below the market price. Apart from Malta, Slovakia and Hungary, too, oppose exerting pressure on the Russian energy sector. However, the EU is already working on a potential 19th sanctions package, MEPs told Izvestia.

The 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions that the EU has yet to agree includes a ban on using the infrastructure of the two Nord Stream gas pipelines. Restrictions would also target two Chinese lenders that cooperate with Moscow, and a Russian oil refinery in India.

The oil price ceiling is the least effective of all sanctions imposed since 2022, says Sergey Tereshkin, Director General of Open Oil Market. According to him, EU countries are guided by bureaucratic logic as the adoption of each new package creates an appearance of ‘doing something', regardless of whether individual measures work or not.

Besides, the fundamental factors of the oil market, rather than restrictions imposed by the EU or the G7, largely impact compliance with the oil price cap, with Urals following the lead of Brent as it trades at a $10 to $12 discount to the benchmark. ""Therefore, the Urals price may drop below $50 per barrel only if Brent hovers at around $60. However, fundamental factors are not yet aligned for that, even amid a drag on demand and higher OPEC+ quotas,"" Tereshkin adds.

Apart from Malta, Slovakia, Hungary, and some other EU countries may voice concerns about maritime trade or finance, among other specific sectors, MEP Tomas Zdechovksy noted, even as there is no broad consolidated opposition beyond these three countries. And the EU is already discussing additional sanctions, despite all differences. ""A 19th package is being considered already, albeit the discussions are at an early and unofficial stage. A technical, not political weariness of sanctions has been a key hurdle,"" Zdechovksy told Izvestia. Coordinating new sanctions has been increasingly difficult as fresh measures should be targeted, legally sound, and feasible, he argued.

 

In June, global aluminum prices grew to a three-month high amid the escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict to reach the average monthly level of $2,516 per ton, last month's report from Kept shows. The metal saw a 3% rise from May and the prices continued to grow in July, according to data from the London Metal Exchange (LME): on July 14, three-month aluminum rose to $2,593 per metric ton, an increase of 6% from early June, and, on July 10, aluminum traded even higher, at $2,611/ (+7%), or a record since March.

Analysts at Kept explain last month's increase in prices with traders' concerns that political tensions in the Middle East will trigger aluminum supply disruptions. According to the International Aluminium Institute, the Gulf countries account for 9% of global aluminum production. Excluding the largest supplier, China, their share amounts to 21% globally, Kept noted.

Aluminum prices rose in June because US tariff talks with a number of countries broke down, Maxim Khudalov, an independent industry expert, maintains. Alexey Kalachev, an analyst at Finam, agrees that US import tariffs have pushed metal prices higher. Since early April, aluminum prices have grown by around 10%, even as they trade below the level seen in February, Kalachev said. According to the expert, the global market is still experiencing oversupply, and aluminum production exceeded consumption by almost 540,000 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025.

Russia is the world's third-largest aluminum supplier after China and India, and Rusal is Russia's largest aluminum producer and exporter. Last year, the Russian aluminum monopoly raised production by 4% to 3.99 million metric tons. Higher aluminum prices have supported Rusal's revenue but they do not guarantee it any growth in financial performance, Vasily Danilov, a lead analyst at Veles Capital, told Vedomosti. However, he expects Rusal's revenue to grow by 11% in 2025, predicting that its EBITDA and profitability will reach approximately 9% and 12% respectively.

 

On Monday, Bitcoin beat another historical record by climbing above $123,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency is becoming an increasingly important asset for both institutional investors and individual companies. Besides, market players expect the Fed to ease its monetary policy soon, which is pushing up demand for high-risk assets.

Alexander Kraiko, a lead analyst at Cifra Markets, noted that the Bitcoin price rose from $119,000 to $123,000 between 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. Moscow time (GMT +3) on July 14, which reflects ""the high demand for bitcoin from Asian investors.""

Market players say Bitcoin has been recognized as a financial asset on Wall Street. There has been a steady inflow of institutional funds into this segment of late, mostly through spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Experts estimate that the leading cryptocurrency could as well rise to $135,000 or even $150,000 in the coming months amid positive investor sentiment. Nor do they rule out any major price corrections. Ryan Lee, a lead analyst at Bitget Research, says Bitcoin may ""fall back to the range of $105,000 to $115,000 against the backdrop of profit-taking, debates about the rate and geopolitical risks."" Uncertainty around Trump's trade policy, too, remains. Vasily Girya, CEO of GIS Mining, told Kommersant that ""investors are balancing between optimism over potential monetary easing by the Fed, risks of escalating trade wars, and geoeconomics."" However, he doubts Bitcoin will rise above $160,000 this year in the absence of new fundamental drivers.

Chipmaker's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently met with Donald Trump as US-China trade rivalry deepens

Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, says the chipmaker has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China.

“Today, I'm announcing that the US government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing.

The news came in a company blog post late on Monday.

“The US government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,” the post said.

Huang also spoke about the coup on China's state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X. Chinese buyers have lined up to buy the semiconductors in response to the news, according to early reports.

“It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market,” he said. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.

Huang recently met with Donald Trump and other US policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials. The broadcast showed the executive meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor.

Nvidia has profited enormously from rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4tn last week. However, the trade rivalry between the US and China has been weighing heavily on the company and the industry writ large.

Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that knowhow meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities that would compete with those from the US.

In January, before Trump began his second term in office, the Biden administration launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. Then in April, Trump's White House announced that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips to China.

Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5bn, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder US competition in a leading-edge sector in one of the world's largest markets for technology.

They've also warned that US export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China's AI technology.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

GDP grows 5.2% in second quarter as world's second largest economy ‘front-loads' shipments before tariffs kick in

Business live – latest updates

China's economy grew more strongly than expected in the second quarter as it proved resilient in the face of Donald Trump's trade war.

China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.2% in April to June compared with a year earlier, slowing from 5.4% in the first quarter, but just ahead of analysts' expectations for a rise of 5.1%.

The world's second largest economy has so far avoided a sharp slowdown in part due to support by Beijing and as factories took advantage of a US-China trade truce to make shipments before tariffs kicked in, or “front-loading”.

However, investors are bracing for a weaker second half as exports lose momentum, prices continue to fall, and consumer confidence remains low.

Last month, the US and China extended the truce after two days of talks in London that resulted in a “framework” deal over export restrictions on rare earths and semiconductors.

Washington and Beijing have until 12 August to renew that deal or face a return to the staggering bilateral tariffs that risked introducing a virtual embargo on trade between the world's two biggest economies.

China's economy is heavily dependent on exports, and the US is its biggest market. In recent years, companies have moved their supply chains outside China in an attempt to avoid tariffs, and Chinese businesses have also been developing non-US markets. But no country can replace the purchasing power of US consumers.

The trade war has spread into non-tariff measures, such as restrictions on rare earths exports, causing manufacturing slowdowns for western carmakers.

China's policymakers face a daunting task in achieving the annual growth target of about 5% – a goal many analysts view as ambitious given entrenched deflation and weak demand at home.

Wei Yao, an economist at Société Générale, said: “Despite a strong first half, the outlook is set to sour in [the second half of the year] as export front-loading fades and the impact of US tariffs becomes more visible.

“Renewed weakness in house prices and the fading impact of subsidies also cast doubt over the sustainability of the consumption recovery.”

Indeed, the solid headline GDP numbers held little sway for most households including Mallory Jiang, a 30-year-old doctor in the southern tech hub Shenzhen, who told Reuters she and her husband had pay cuts this year.

“Both our incomes as doctors have decreased, and we still don't dare buy an apartment. We are cutting back on expenses: commuting by public transport, eating at the hospital cafeteria or cooking at home. My life pressure is still actually quite high.”

On a quarterly basis, GDP grew 1.1% in April to June, the National Bureau of Statistics data showed, compared with a forecast 0.9% increase and a 1.2% gain in the previous quarter.

Investors are closely watching for signs of fresh stimulus at the upcoming politburo meeting due in late July, which is likely to shape economic policy for the remainder of the year.

Beijing has ramped up infrastructure spending and consumer subsidies, alongside monetary easing. In May, the central bank cut interest rates and injected liquidity as part of broader efforts to cushion the economy from US tariffs.

Some analysts believe the government could increase deficit spending if growth slows sharply.

Singh's east London running club confirms death in India of athlete thought to be first centenarian to run a marathon

The runner Fauja Singh, believed to be the oldest person to complete a marathon, has died in a road accident in India aged 114.

The athlete, who lived in Ilford in east London, was hit by a car and suffered fatal injuries while trying to cross a road in his birth village of Beas Pind, near Jalandhar in Punjab, on Monday, according to reports in India.

His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs in the City, confirmed his death and said its upcoming events in Ilford would be a celebration of his life and achievements.

Singh's coach, Harmander Singh, wrote on Facebook: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm our icon of humanity and powerhouse of positivity Fauja Singh has passed away in India. Aged 114 years old.

“He succumbed to injuries caused by a vehicle accident while crossing the road close to his home.”

Singh made his name by beating a number of records for marathon times in different age brackets. The centenarian became an inspiration for countless athletes by running marathons past the age of 100.

A profile on the Olympics website said Singh was born in Punjab, then under British rule, on 1 April 1911 and was the youngest of four children in a farming family. He moved to England and settled in east London with his son after the death of his wife, Gian Kaur, in Jalandhar.

It was not until 2000, aged 89, that he took up running, quickly rising to fame by completing his maiden marathon in London in six hours and 54 minutes. This time knocked 58 minutes off the previous world's best in the 90-plus age bracket.

Singh ran numerous marathons, completing the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon in five hours and 40 minutes, his personal best. On 16 October 2011 in Toronto, he is thought to have become the first centenarian to run a marathon.

The MP Preet Kaur Gill said on X: “Saddened to hear about the passing of Fauja Singh. I had the honour of meeting him. A truly inspiring man. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me.

“A reminder that age is just a number, but attitude is everything. Rest in power, legend.”

Reuters

11:48 JST, July 15, 2025

July 15 (Reuters) – A million more children completed the critical three-dose vaccination against diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to new data released by the World Health Organization.

Despite the progress, drastic changes in funding, growing global conflicts, and rising vaccine misinformation threaten to further stall or even reverse progress which poses a threat.

“We've hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult,” WHO's director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, Kate O'Brien, told reporters.

In 2024, 89% of infants globally, about 115 million, received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, and roughly 109 million completed all three doses of the staple shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, also known as whooping cough, according to the new national immunization coverage data released on Tuesday by the WHO and UNICEF.

But, nearly 20 million infants missed at least one dose of DTP-containing vaccine, which includes 14.3 million “zero-dose” children who never received a single dose of any vaccine.

This is 4 million more than the target for the year needed to stay on track with Immunization Agenda 2030 goals, the report added.

The world is currently off track for the goal, which has been to halve the number of zero-dose children and achieve at least 90% global immunization coverage.

Data shows a quarter of the world's infants live in just 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict, or humanitarian crises, yet make up half of all unvaccinated children globally.

In half of these countries the number of unvaccinated children has expanded rapidly from 3.6 million in 2019 to 5.4 million in 2024.

“We're starting to see the emerging signs of slippage, and in other countries, stalling of vaccine coverage,” said O'Brien.

Despite the challenges, countries have been able to scale up vaccines for diseases such as HPV, meningitis, pneumococcal disease, polio, and rotavirus.

In 2024, 31% of eligible adolescent girls globally received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine.

While this is far from the 90% coverage target by 2030, it represents a substantial increase from the 17% coverage in 2019.

Global coverage against measles also improved, but the overall coverage rate is far below the 95% needed in every community to prevent outbreaks.

“The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

A Kremlin spokesperson called on July 15 U.S. President Donald Trump's warnings of ""severe"" tariffs ""serious"" but said Moscow needs time to analyze the message from Washington.

Trump's remarks came during a July 14 White House press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, where the U.S. president threatened to impose 100% ""secondary tariffs"" on Russia if a peace deal in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. 

""This statement from the U.S. president is quite serious. Some of what he said appears to be addressed personally to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russian state-controlled news outlet RBC. 

""We undoubtedly need time to analyze what was said in Washington. If and when President Putin considers it necessary, he will comment on it.""

Trump expressed frustration with Putin's actions, saying he had expected an agreement months ago. 

""I speak to Putin a lot about getting this done, and then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city,"" he said. In recent weeks, Russia has significantly intensified its air attacks on Ukrainian cities, targeting civilian infrastructure and causing numerous civilian casualties.

Russian Security Council Deputy Chair and former President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed Trump's warning as a ""theatrical ultimatum.""

""The world shuddered, expecting the consequences. Belligerent Europe was disappointed. Russia didn't care,"" Medvedev wrote on X.

During their joint conference, Rutte and Trump also unveiled a NATO-coordinated plan to purchase and deliver advanced U.S.-made weapons, including air defense systems, to Ukraine. 

Trump said NATO allies would fully finance the deliveries, which could be redistributed from European stocks and replaced through U.S. sales. Rutte said Ukraine would receive ""massive numbers"" of air defense systems, missiles, and ammunition.

Top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas welcomed Trump's tough rhetoric but criticized the timeline. 

""On one hand, it is very positive that President Trump is taking on a strong stance on Russia... On the other hand, 50 days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians,"" she said.

Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

Donald Trump encouraged the strategy so that Russia could ""feel the pain"" and agree to negotiations, the Financial Times reported, citing its sources.

""The stolen data includes confidential questionnaires of the company's employees, and most importantly, full technical documentation on the production of drones, which was handed over to the relevant specialists of the Ukrainian Defense Forces,"" a source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.

The vote passed by 305 deputies, with 40 abstaining, and none voting against.

The parliament is set to dismiss the government on July 16 as Prime Minister Denys Shymhal submitted his resignation.

Following talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Beijing on July 15, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that mutual trust between the two countries had ""deepened"" and called on both sides to ""strengthen mutual support on multilateral forums.""



The chief executive of Euroclear told the FT that the EU's proposal would amount to ""expropriation"" — forced seizure — because if Russia demands the assets back in the future, they would not be available.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called upon the EU to take action against Ukraine's conscription practices in an interview with Origo published on July 15, amid an ongoing dispute with Kyiv over the death of a Ukrainian conscript of Hungarian ethnicity.

""This statement from the U.S. president is quite serious. Some of what he said appears to be addressed personally to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

According to the SBU, Russian ""special services"" recruited the 27-year-old Lviv resident who was trying to obtain ""easy money"" through Telegram channels.

The facility reportedly manufactures batteries for missile guidance and glider modules, including for the Iskander system and cruise missiles, which Russia has been increasingly using to target Ukrainian cities.

""In the years to come, and by 2030, the main threat to France and Europeans is the risk of open warfare against the heart of Europe,"" France's new National Strategic Review reads.

""On one hand, it is very positive that President Trump is taking on a strong stance on Russia... On the other hand, 50 days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians,"" EU Special Envoy Kaja Kallas said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed a deal with Moscow had been close on four separate occasions.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he is ""disappointed but not done"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone interview with the BBC published on July 15. 

""I'm disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him,"" Trump said of Putin, adding, ""I trust almost no one."" 

The remarks came just hours after Trump announced plans to ramp up arms deliveries to Ukraine and to impose significant tariffs on Russia if no peace deal is reached.

During the call, Trump endorsed NATO and again warned Russia of severe consequences unless it agrees to a ceasefire in Ukraine within 50 days.

The U.S. president said he believed a deal with Moscow had been close on four separate occasions. ""We'll have a great conversation. I'll say: 'That's good, I'll think we're close to getting it done,' and then he'll knock down a building in Kyiv,"" Trump told the BBC.

The BBC interview followed Trump's meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House on July 14, where the two leaders outlined a new joint plan to supply Ukraine with advanced U.S. weaponry. 

Trump said that some Patriot air defense systems and missiles could arrive in Ukraine ""within days,"" noting that certain NATO countries were agreeing to swap out their systems to expedite delivery.

Trump also defended NATO, calling it ""the opposite of obsolete"" — a contrast to his previous criticism of the alliance. In June, during the NATO summit in The Hague, NATO member states agreed to allocate 5% of their gross domestic product annually to defense and security-related expenditures by 2035.

The former NATO critic now backs a U.S.-led initiative to sell $10 billion worth of advanced weapons to European allies, being the first wave of arms designed to support Ukraine. The package reportedly includes missiles, artillery shells, and air defense systems, according to Axios.

President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the announcements in a phone call with Trump, thanking him for ""willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.""

 U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker said in an interview with Fox News that the move sends a clear message to Moscow.

""President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it,"" Whitaker said. ""This is a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion.""

The Washington Post reported, citing a single anonymous source involved in the decision, that Trump might also authorize Kyiv to use the 18 ATACMS missiles currently in Ukraine at their full range of 300 kilometers (about 190 miles). He may also allegedly supply more of these missiles.

Trump also reportedly previously considered supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, weapons capable of striking Moscow and St. Petersburg, but their delivery is not on the table at the moment. The claims could not be independently verified.

According to the Washington Post, Trump asked Zelensky in the recent call why Ukraine had not struck Moscow. 

""We can if you give us the weapons,"" Zelensky reportedly replied. Trump is said to have responded that Ukraine must increase pressure on Putin, not just in Moscow but also in St. Petersburg.

Carolina Wilga thanked Australians for their help, saying she made it out of the wilderness because of the ""outpouring of support."" She had spent 11 nights in Australia's remote Outback.

German backpacker Carolina Wilga thanked her ""rescuer and angel"" in a statement she issued Monday from the hospital where she's recovering in Perth, the state capital of Western Australia.

Wilga, who is 26 years old, was found 11 nights after she was lost in the remote Outback of Australia, having survived dangerous terrain and harsh temperatures.

Her car was spotted a day before she was rescued by a member of the public in a chance encounter. 

A Western Australian police inspector told reporters last week that it was a ""miracle"" to have found her car because of the rugged terrain.

Wilga's family had last heard from her on June 29, and Australian farmer Tania Henley found her on July 11.

Henley told Australia's public broadcaster that Wilga was waving at her from the side of a road she had been walking along.

Wilga had walked barefoot in the remote reserve of Outback after abandoning her van away from any established track. She wrote in her statement that she had lost control of the car.

""Some people might wonder why I even left my car, even though I had water, food, and clothing there. The answer is: I lost control of the car and rolled down a slope. In the crash, I hit my head significantly. As a result of the accident, I left my car in a state of confusion and got lost,"" she said.

Australian public broadcaster ABC reported that Wilga was ultimately found over 30 kilometers (over 18.6 miles) away from where she had left her car.

Western Australian police earlier said that the traveler had survived by drinking rainwater and water from puddles.

Wilga thanked the Western Australia community for their help and said she was certain she survived because of the ""outpouring of support"" she received from people. Her statement in full is:

""First and foremost, I want to express a huge thank you from the bottom of my heart — a thank you that truly comes from the depth of my soul! For all the incredible support during the search for me.

Previously, I didn't know where my place was in a culture on the other side of the world to my own, but now, I feel a part of it. I am deeply impressed by the courage, helpfulness, and warmth that has been shown to me here. Western Australia has taught me what it really means to be part of a true community. Here, humanity, solidarity, and care for one another are what truly matter — and in the end, that's what counts most.

I am certain that I survived only thanks to this incredible outpouring of support. The thought of all the people who believed in me, searched for me, and kept hoping for me gave me the strength to carry on during my darkest moments. For this, I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Especially to the police investigators, searchers, the German Consulate, the medical staff and the wonderful nurses who took care of me with so much compassion. My deepest thanks also go to every single person who simply thought of me — and of course, to my rescuer and angel, Tania!

Some people might wonder why I even left my car, even though I had water, food, and clothing there. The answer is: I lost control of the car and rolled down a slope. In the crash, I hit my head significantly. As a result of the accident, I left my car in a state of confusion and got lost.

I am simply beyond grateful to have survived.

Thank you, Australia — you are amazing.""

Yuliia Svyrydenko would become the country's second female prime minister in history once her candidacy is approved by parliament. She is currently Ukraine's economy minister. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Monday that he had asked Yuliia Svyrydenko to become the new prime minister.

""I have proposed that Yuliia Svyrydenko lead the government of Ukraine and significantly renew its work. I look forward to the presentation of the new government's action plan in the near future,"" Zelenskyy wrote on X.

Yuliia Svyrydenko is currently Ukraine's economy minister, with her role becoming especially prominent in the media this year because of the mineral deal that eventually came to be signed by the US and Ukraine.

A televised spat between the leaders of the US and Ukraine in Washington had ended discussions on the deal in February, when the agreement was originally meant to be signed.

But Svyrydenko has been credited as the person to have traveled to Washington shortly after the spat to get the job done.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been eyeing changes to his cabinet as Ukraine continues to try and fend off Russian forces for the fourth year of war.

Zelenskyy last week announced during a gathering of leaders in Rome that he was considering replacing his current ambassador to the US.

""We need a person (as US ambassador) to be strong and to be in the context of the most important thing, in the context of strengthening Ukraine — through weapons, first of all. Therefore, one of my ideas is that it can be Ukraine's defense minister.""

But other names have also been floated for the job for the country's next ambassador to the US as well, and a final decision is pending.

Svyrydenko is 39 years old and has held a number of posts in the state administration of Chernihiv region in the north, where she was born.

She then quickly rose through the ranks and became deputy head of the presidential office, and in 2021, became the economy minister and deputy prime minister.

Svyrydenko would replace incumbent Denys Shmyhal, who was appointed as the country's prime minister in 2020.

Her candidacy would still have to be approved by Ukraine's parliament before she can step into the role.

Once approved, she would become Ukraine's second female prime minister after Yulia Tymoshenko, who led the country in the years after the 2004 Orange Revolution.

Police are probing the theft of five thumb drives with unreleased music and concert plans of pop icon Beyonce. They were stolen from a car in the southeastern US city of Atlanta just ahead of her ""Cowboy Carter"" tour.

Police in the southeastern US city of Atlanta have issued a warrant for an unnamed suspect after computer drives containing unreleased music by pop star Beyonce along with plans related to her concerts were stolen on July 8 from a rental car used by her choreographer.

The theft came two days before Beyonce kicked off the Atlanta leg of her ""Cowboy Carter"" tour, named for her 2024 album of the same name.

Beyonce's choreographer, Christopher Grant, told police that when he returned to his rental car last Tuesday, he found that its rear window had been smashed and all the luggage in the vehicle stolen.

In his report, he said the computer drives had ""contained water marked music, some unreleased music, footage plans for the show, and past and future set list (sic).""

He said other items were also missing, such as an Apple MacBook, headphones and several items of luxury clothing.

Police have searched an area where signals from the MacBook and headphones were detected, but no items were reported to have been recovered.

Police said a suspect for whom a warrant has been issued is still at large.

Beyonce's ""Cowboy Carter"" tour kicked off in April after the pop icon received her first ""Album of the Year"" Grammy for the eponymous 2024 album.

The four-night Atlanta leg of the tour ended on Monday, with with two final performances scheduled for late July in Las Vegas.

Last year, Beyonce became the most Grammy nominated artist of all time.

			Torrential rain shuts down subway lines and delays flights with officials warning of ‘life-threatening' flash floods

Heavy rain lashed New York and New Jersey on Monday night, triggering flash floods that shut down subway lines, stranded vehicles and prompted a state of emergency across parts of the US Northeast.

A flash flood warning was issued for all five boroughs of New York City, while watches and warnings were also in place across surrounding areas including Baltimore, Newark, New Jersey, and Arlington, Virginia.

Some 50 million Americans across the Northeast were under flood watches.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency late on Monday “due to flash flooding and high levels of rainfall in parts of the state”.

He urged residents to “stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel”, adding “stay safe, New Jersey”, in a post on X.

Videos posted online showed floodwaters rushing through streets. One clip captured cars submerged in New Jersey as alarms blared in the background.

Flash flooding was reported in Bergen and Union counties, where the National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening” conditions.

Some buses and trains in New Jersey were delayed due to the weather.

Meanwhile in New York City, some subway services were suspended or running with severe delays because of heavy rainfall, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.

Footage shared on social media showed water surging into underground stations. One video appeared to show a Manhattan platform completely flooded, with passengers climbing onto train seats to escape the rising water.

City officials urged residents to steer clear of flood-prone areas. “If you live in a basement apartment or low-lying area, be ready to move to higher ground,” New York City Emergency Management said in a post on X.

On Staten Island, railway services were suspended in both directions due to flooding. A flood warning was issued for the area which had recorded about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 centimetres) of rain, according to NYC's emergency notification system.

At least one water rescue operation was under way in Westchester County, north of New York City.

“At this time, residents are still strongly advised to avoid all travel unless fleeing an area that is subject to flooding, or under an evacuation order,” said Carolyn Fortino, a spokesperson for the county executive.

Airports across the East Coast also faced widespread disruption. A total of 1,966 flights were cancelled and more than 10,000 were delayed.

Ground stops were issued at LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports, while John F. Kennedy Airport warned of widespread delays.

United Airlines, which has a hub at Newark, said: “Severe weather conditions are impacting operations at Newark Liberty with a ground stop issued to manage volume and limit congestion.”

			Former Israeli prime minister also refutes claim Epstein worked for Israel's national intelligence agency

Jeffrey Epstein laughed off claims that he was an Israeli spy, his former attorney has said.

Alan Dershowitz, who helped secure the controversial “sweetheart deal” for Epstein, said the disgraced financier denied being a foreign agent when grilled on the subject.

Epstein has been accused in recent days of being a Mossad spy by the likes of Tucker Carlson – something that has been strongly denied by Israel.

It comes as the Epstein case has come under renewed scrutiny over the potentially damaging so-called ‘client list' that has failed to materialise despite promises from the Trump administration.

Asked about the claims that Epstein was a spy potentially holding leverage on the rich and powerful, Mr Dershowitz told The Telegraph: “We discussed it and the answer was no. He laughed. No intelligence agency would really trust him.” 

Mr Dershowitz said he was convinced Epstein would have told him if he was a spy “to try to get him a better deal”.

“That's not something he would keep from his lawyers. That's something he would tell his lawyers,” he said.

Theories about Epstein's supposed connection to intelligence agencies began to surface shortly after he was found to have hanged himself in his Manhattan prison cell while awaiting trial in 2019.

The conspiracy had added fuel to a growing belief in the Maga movement that Epstein was murdered to prevent the names of high-profile associates being made public.

On Monday, former Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett vigorously rebutted the claim, criticising the “vicious wave of slander and lies against” the Jewish state.

“As a former Israeli Prime Minister, with the Mossad having reported directly to me, I say to you with 100 per cent certainty: The accusation that Jeffrey Epstein somehow worked for Israel or the Mossad running a blackmail ring is categorically and totally false,” Mr Bennett wrote.

“This accusation is a lie being peddled by prominent online personalities such as Tucker Carlson pretending they know things they don't.”

Donald Trump is facing the biggest internal rebellion of his premiership after the Department of Justice last week concluded the disgraced financier had no “client list” and died by suicide, not murder.

The decision has sparked fury among Maga loyalists, who have called for Pam Bondi, Mr Trump's attorney general, to resign over her mishandling of the case.

As the White House scrambles to contain the row, Mr Trump is said to be weighing up removing redactions to previously released documents related to the deceased sex offender in a bid to placate his Maga supporters, according to Axios.

During an interview in March, Mr Dershowitz said the client list is being withheld in an effort to “protect” those involved with Epstein's crimes.

The Harvard law professor was accused by Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts of having sexual relationships with minors. She later acknowledged that she may have made a mistake in identifying Mr Dershowitz as one of her abusers.

“My position is I want everything revealed. I want everything out there,” he told The Telegraph.

“I know there are names. There are people's names that are being suppressed, and I know that there are still documents.”

Ms Bondi, Kash Patel, the FBI director, and Dan Bongino, the bureau's deputy director, have been heavily criticised by Trump supporters for failing to uncover a broader conspiracy relating to Epstein.

Conservative influencers from Megyn Kelly to Mr Carlson have called for Ms Bondi to resign over her failure to deliver, after she claimed in February that Epstein's client list was “sitting on my desk”.

“I think the real answer is Jeffrey Epstein was working on behalf of intel services, probably not American. And we have every right to ask, on whose behalf was he working?”, Mr Carlson said during a speech on Friday.

“Now, no one's allowed to say that the foreign government is Israel because we have been somehow cowed into thinking that's naughty. There is nothing wrong with saying that,” he added.

The US Supreme Court let Donald Trump resume dismantling the department of education by lifting a lower court order that required the reinstatement of as many as 1,400 workers.Granting an emergency request from the administration over three dissents, the justices put on hold a federal district court ruling that said Mr Trump's purge would leave the department unable to perform duties required under US law. The Supreme Court order will apply while the case continues on appeal. 

The court's three liberals dissented. Writing for the group, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the decision as “indefensible” and said it gave the president “the power to repeal statutes by firing all those necessary to carry them out.”“The majority is either wilfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive, but either way the threat to our Constitution's separation of powers is grave,” said Justice Sotomayor, who was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.The ruling reinforces the Supreme Court's decision last week to let Mr Trump broadly move ahead with a push to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce. The July 8 decision didn't address the lawfulness of individual agency plans, and the latest ruling could boost the administration as it defends against legal challenges to those actions.

Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said in an emailed statement: “Today, the Supreme Court again confirmed the obvious.

“The president of the United States, as the head of the executive branch, has the ultimate authority to make decisions about staffing levels, administrative organisation, and day-to-day operations of federal agencies.”Ms McMahon announced on March 11 that the department was cutting half its staff through a reduction in force. Mr Trump followed with a March 20 executive order that said McMahon should “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education.”

The effort is being challenged in two lawsuits, one brought primarily by states led by Democrats and the other filed by several Massachusetts public school systems and unions.Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward which represents schools and unions, said: “Without explaining to the American people its reasoning, a majority of justices on the US Supreme Court have dealt a devastating blow to this nation's promise of public education for all children.”The New York attorney general's office, which led the coalition of states, didn't immediately return requests for comment.US District Judge Myong Joun in Boston ruled in May that the personnel cuts would “likely cripple the department.” He said the challengers would probably succeed in showing that Mr Trump was effectively dissolving the department by getting rid of its employees, closing regional offices and moving programmes to other federal agencies.“A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” Mr Joun wrote. “This court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the department's employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the department becomes a shell of itself.”The Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals refused to block Joun's ruling, paving the way for Mr Trump's Supreme Court request.The case is the latest to address Mr Trump's authority to dismantle entities created by Congress, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the US Agency for International Development and the US Institute of Peace.

On a late March morning in 2024 in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, 24-year-old Yasmin Siam felt sharp pain grip her stomach. Labor had begun. Time was slipping away. But there was no way to get her to a hospital.

Ambulances had become rare after months of Israeli attacks — too few to answer every cry for help. Airstrikes were ongoing, and Gaza had fallen into total immobility. Cars were gone. Fuel was gone. And ambulances, often targeted, had mostly been destroyed or left in flames.

With no other option, Siam's family placed her on a donkey cart — the only remaining form of “transportation” in a time where movement itself had died. The journey to Nasser Hospital, which should have taken 20 minutes, took over an hour due to the wreckage, craters, and collapsed roads across Khan Younis.

By the time she arrived, Siam was bleeding dangerously. Her blood pressure was collapsing. Doctors tried everything they could with the little they had. But then came the words that shattered her: “Your baby didn't make it.”

It was her first child.

The child did not die because of war wounds, but because movement throughout Gaza has been decimated.

Yasmin Siam's heartbreaking story is just one of many amid the widespread crisis gripping Gaza's transportation system. During the temporary ceasefire that lasted about 60 days — from late November 2023 until the end of January 2024 — the displaced residents of northern Gaza, who had fled south and remained trapped far from their destroyed homes for over a year, began to return north. During this period, the Israeli occupation designated specific days for walking and other days for permitting vehicles for Palestinians returning north. But Palestinians couldn't wait; fear of the war restarting consumed them. So, many returned on foot, walking more than 30 kilometers.

Water is scarce in Gaza. We search for it in far-off places, then carry it home through harsh, punishing paths. Even a sip of water has become a journey of pain.

Among them was the family of my uncle Iyad, who had fled to Khan Younis. He told me the story of an elderly man, about 80 years old, who suddenly collapsed while walking — dying on his way back home. He could not bear the long journey and exhaustion; he died before reaching safety. The story was heartbreaking, but I felt that the very attempt to return gave him a small measure of joy after a year of sorrow. For this man, returning home was a dream. Yet, he never made it — his body weaker than his will.

But the most painful story — the one I witnessed with my own eyes and will never forget — happened during the ground siege imposed by Israeli forces in February 2024.

During those terrifying days, we sealed every window shut. No sound. No light. Any sign of life could bring death to everyone in the neighborhood. But at around 7:00 am, I heard a young man crying faintly, “I'm thirsty.” I crept to the window, peeking through a narrow crack. Outside, I saw him — a young man who had been riding his bicycle. A tank had fired on him, and he was struck in the shoulder.

It wasn't a fatal injury. He could have survived. He was lying directly beneath my home, crying out, asking for water. I heard every word. But I didn't — couldn't — move. I knew that stepping outside meant death. Not just for me, but for everyone in the house. I still carry the guilt. I didn't save him, though I could hear him dying. But in my heart, I also knew: during the siege, no ambulances ever came. No rescue was possible. Even the smallest wound became a death sentence.

He kept bleeding for hours, his voice growing weaker… until it vanished. Three days later, after the Israeli army withdrew, neighbors found his body and buried him in the yard of Al-Qahira School in Al-Rimal. There were no proper burials anymore. The cemeteries were full. There was no transport left to reach them. In Gaza, even the act of burying the dead has become a luxury. Schoolyards and hospital courtyards are now our mass graves.

The suffering caused by the absence of transportation doesn't stop — it continues in countless forms. When aid is distributed, it's often near the Netzarim checkpoint, the dividing line between northern and southern Gaza. People from both sides walk more than 15 kilometers just to reach it — on foot. But walking itself requires strength. And who among us still has strength after more than a year and a half of hunger and malnutrition? Imagine someone walking 15 kilometers to reach the aid, then another 15 kilometers back — and often returning with nothing.

Take my father, for example. He has lost over 20 kilograms — not just because of the lack of food, but from the endless walking. When basic supplies become available, he walks and walks to get them and comes back utterly exhausted. And what about the elderly? The ones who carry heavy water containers on their backs because there is no transport to help them? Water is scarce in Gaza. We search for it in far-off places, then carry it home through harsh, punishing paths. Even a sip of water has become a journey of pain.

What we suffer from today is beyond words — even donkey carts are vanishing. The horse-drawn carts disappeared long ago, most of them targeted and destroyed, as if no form of movement should be left to us. The few donkeys that survived are now dying slowly from hunger. Seeing a living animal on Gaza's streets has become rare. On June 28, 2025, I saw it with my own eyes: A donkey had collapsed on the road, too weak to stand, while its owner struggled helplessly to lift it. He tried everything — pulling, calling, pleading — but nothing worked. The animal was simply too frail, too starved to move.

If even our last means of transport collapses in the street, what hope is left for the humans who still need to run?

If even our last means of transport collapses in the street, what hope is left for the humans who still need to run?

Imagine a father running down a silent street in Gaza, his child bleeding in his arms. “Hold on,” he whispers. “We'll get to the hospital.” But there are no cars. No ambulances. Not even a cart. Only the sound of his footsteps — and his son's fading breath. The boy dies — not only from the wound, but from the brutal fact that there was no way to move.

In Gaza, life has died in every form. No homes. No hospitals. No streets. No transport. All that remains are tents — and exhausted bodies slowly dying, silently, in all the ways Gaza teaches us to die.

Trump has benefited for years from a MAGA conspiracy theory alleging that Jeffrey Epstein kept a “client list.”

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

One week after the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document stating that there was never a Jeffrey Epstein “client list” — a supposed list of child sex predators and traffickers that is the center of a conspiracy theory that right-wingers have promoted for years — President Donald Trump, who benefited from that conspiracy theory, has expressed frustration that his MAGA base isn't moving on.

The refusal of Trump's base to believe the DOJ and Attorney General Pam Bondi's newest assessment of the Epstein files is visibly frustrating the president, who has lashed out at his followers on social media and derided reporters for questioning the new narrative.

Believers in the Epstein “client list” conspiracy theory allege that Epstein, a financier and former friend of Trump's, used the list as political leverage against public figures, including liberal and left-leaning individuals. Members of Trump's own administration, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, played a role in spreading the theory prior to assuming their posts. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Trump, who was president when Epstein was arrested and subsequently died in jail, wasn't a direct promoter of the conspiracy theory. But he did discuss it in interviews, including in September 2024, at the height of the presidential campaign season.

“I'd certainly take a look at it,” Trump said in regards to releasing the files relating to Epstein, adding that he'd be “inclined” to release such a list and would have “no problem” with doing so. He also called it “very interesting” that the supposed list had not yet been made public, implying that the Biden administration was purposefully keeping the names hidden.

Earlier this month, however, the DOJ announced that there is no Epstein “client list,” that there was “no credible evidence” of a blackmail conspiracy, and that Epstein indeed died by suicide while in jail, contradicting years of questions regarding the official narrative that Trump had benefited from.

The document is also a stark departure from what Bondi had stated earlier this year. In an interview in February, when asked if an Epstein list would be released, Bondi responded affirmatively, saying it was on her desk waiting for review.

Last week, however, she claimed that her response did not mean that the client list was real — instead, she was referring to files relating to Epstein, she said. 

Since that time, Trump's supporters have taken issue with the DOJ's conclusions, with some revolting against him on social media. Some of Trump's allies in Congress, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), have also expressed skepticism over the administration's new line. 

“I have to be honest, it's just a red line that it crosses for many people,” Greene said in an interview on Monday.

The loyal MAGA base Trump relied on for so many years now appears to be “genuinely fractured,” read an assessment of the situation from Politico published this week.

Days after the DOJ document was released, a reporter asked Bondi to comment during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump, visibly upset over the question, interjected.

“Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable. Do you want to waste the time?” he asked.

A few days later, Trump told his base it was time to move on.

“We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

Trump peddled a new conspiracy theory within that same post, baselessly claiming that several figures (including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and others) had written the Epstein files themselves in an effort to hurt him. 

Let's “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,” Trump added.

Democrats are pouncing on the situation. The Democratic National Committee (DNC), for example, has created a new profile on X to remind viewers daily that the supposed Epstein list hasn't been released.

Tim Hogan, the DNC's senior adviser for messaging, has called for the Trump administration to be more transparent. Said Hogan:

Trump administration officials are either lying about the file and keeping it covered up to protect themselves, or they lied about its existence in a shameless political ploy to get elected. Either way, it is disgusting, and they have to be held accountable.

Democratic lawmakers have also spoken out about the matter.

“Either [Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there! Put up or Shut up,” wrote Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas). 

“Democrats didn't put the Jeffrey Epstein thing into the public domain,” Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said at a press conference on Monday. “This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam Bondi and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several years, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.”

The fracturing of Trump's MAGA base is somewhat evident in recent polls.

According to a new Economist/YouGov poll published Tuesday morning, 79 percent of all U.S. voters want the Epstein files to be publicly released, including 83 percent of voters who backed Trump in 2024. Among those voters, there appears to be skepticism with the Trump administration's handling of the files, with nearly 6 in 10 (59 percent) of them saying the government is covering up evidence.

Trump's approval rating among those who voted for him last year is still high, with 84 percent backing him and 13 percent disapproving. But that's a shift from the start of this summer, when 87 percent of his voters approved of his job performance and only 10 percent didn't — and it's a huge shift from the start of this year, when, in early February, 92 percent of Trump voters approved of his job performance and only 5 percent said they disapproved.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

As a lobbyist, Ken Kies secured tax giveaways for major corporations. Now, he's helping implement the GOP budget bill.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

A corporate lobbyist who for decades has helped major companies and rich Americans dodge taxes is now serving as the U.S. Treasury Department's top tax policy official, a position in which he will write rules implementing the newly passed Republican budget law.

That role is “enormously powerful,” The New York Times' Jesse Drucker wrote in a Monday profile of Ken Kies, whom the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate confirmed as assistant treasury secretary for tax policy in a party-line vote last month. President Donald Trump selected Kies for the position in January.

The Republican budget measure, which President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month, contains around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that will flow disproportionately to the wealthiest Americans over the next decade, according to nonpartisan analysts.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“By putting a professional tax-dodging consultant in charge of their tax law, Republicans are continuing to make their intentions crystal clear — this law is a gift to billionaires and huge corporations like those Ken Kies has spent his career looking out for,” Leor Tal, campaign director for the progressive advocacy group Unrig Our Economy, said in a statement Monday.

“As families struggle with rising prices from Trump's tariffs and face devastating cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Tal added, “Republicans are doubling down on helping the richest of the rich, while working people pay the price.”

In his role as a lobbyist whose client list has included Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Microsoft, and other corporate behemoths, Kies has helped secure major tax giveaways for large companies and wealthy Americans — including in the 2017 Trump-GOP tax law that the new Republican budget package extends.

“In the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kies successfully pushed for legislation to make such offshore tax dodges even easier to execute. During the Obama administration, he fended off another attempted crackdown on those strategies,” Drucker wrote Monday. “In 2017, as part of a sweeping package of tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Kies lobbied for a new tax break that provides a 20% deduction to certain businesses, which overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans.”

Drucker noted that in his new position, Kies “will oversee about 100 attorneys and economists at the Treasury Department's Office of Tax Policy, a powerful corner of the federal government.”

“The office issues regulations to help the government administer tax laws and provides guidance that can render the latest tax-dodging strategy a gold mine — or doom it,” he added.

Kies previously served as managing director of the Federal Policy Group, a lobbying firm at which he “delivered significant legislative and regulatory results for his clients, which include major corporations, trade associations, and coalitions of companies with common objectives,” according to a since-removed biography of Kies.

“Mr. Kies has led coalition efforts to enact legislation responding to the World Trade Organization's ruling against U.S. foreign sales corporation benefits, to avert enactment of broad ‘corporate tax shelter' legislation that would have an adverse impact on legitimate business transactions, and to reverse Treasury regulations targeting ‘hybrid' arrangements of U.S. multinational corporations, among other projects,” the biography stated.

Highlighting the Times profile of Kies, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote Monday that the Trump administration is “wallowing in corruption.”

“Five trillion dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest, written and administered by the wealthiest,” she wrote. “On the backs of stripping healthcare and food from working and poor people. Shame on you.”

In addition to implementing the new Trump-GOP law, Kies could be positioned to help deliver another sizable tax break to the rich.

The Washington Post's Jeff Stein reported last week that on the heels of passage of the GOP budget law, right-wing organizations and Republican lawmakers are set to push the Trump administration to unilaterally “drastically reduce what investors pay on their capital gains.”

“The plan rests on changing how the Treasury Department calculates those taxes,” Stein wrote. “The highest-earning 1% of Americans would receive 86% of the benefits from indexing capital gains to inflation, while the bottom 80% of income earners would get just 1% of the benefits, Penn Wharton projected in 2018.”

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, wrote in response to Stein's reporting that “after gutting health care for millions of Americans and passing massive tax breaks for billionaires, Republicans are now working on even MORE tax breaks for the ultra-rich.”

“They aren't interested in fighting for working families — only their rich friends,” Boyle added.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

In June, the United Nations planned to convene a conference on the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by France and Saudi Arabia, the assembled nations were expected to agree to recognize a Palestinian state and call for a renewed peace process, presumably based on the 2002 Saudi-led Arab Peace Initiative, which proposed full peace between the Arab states and Israel after the creation of a Palestinian state.

Israel repeatedly condemned the conference, and the United States was less than enthusiastic. “We are urging governments not to participate in the conference,” read a cable sent in June by the State Department in Washington to U.S. embassies around the world, according to Reuters. “The United States opposes any steps that would unilaterally recognize a conjectural Palestinian state, which adds significant legal and political obstacles to the eventual resolution of the conflict and could coerce Israel during a war, thereby supporting its enemies,” the cable stated.

The Trump administration had a more fundamental objection to the conference: it opposes not merely the recognition of a Palestinian state but also the establishment of such a state. “Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there's no room for it,” said Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, in an interview with Bloomberg News, adding that he did not expect to see such an outcome “in our lifetime.” And if such a state ever emerges, he suggested, it should not be located in the Palestinian territories that Israel occupies but should instead be carved out of “a Muslim country.”

Just days before the conference was supposed to begin, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on Iran. The resulting 12-day war, which the United States eventually joined, overshadowed the Israeli-Palestinian issue and made it logistically impossible to move forward with the conference, which was postponed. “This postponement cannot undermine our determination to move forward with the implementation of the two-state solution,” French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference. “Whatever the circumstances,” he added, “I have stated my determination to recognize the state of Palestine.”

Macron is not alone, and the momentum in favor of broader recognition is likely to keep building in the coming weeks and months. Whether or not the UN conference ever takes place as planned, the issue of international recognition is not going away.

The reality on the ground may appear less conducive to a revival of the two-state solution than to the consolidation of a one-state reality. The Israeli war in Gaza is paving the way for the return of direct Israeli control, settlement of the territory, and the possible expulsion of Palestinians. In the West Bank, Israeli settlers backed by Israeli security forces have stepped up a campaign of violence and intimidation, emptying Palestinian communities in an effort to lay the groundwork for Israeli annexation. Israeli officials make clear that they have no interest in a two-state solution, a position publicly expressed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, most recently when President Donald Trump hosted him in the White House in early July. And according to numerous media reports, the details of Trump's proposals for a “grand bargain” linking the end of the Gaza war to further normalization between Israel and Arab countries do not include Palestinian statehood in the mix.

But recognition of a Palestinian state may not be fully off the table. The costs of the ongoing conflict are high, and Trump seems to incline toward a perspective on regional issues similar to those of the leaders of Gulf states, who prioritize stability and need to show their people some progress on the Palestinian issue to justify further cooperation. Seen through the prism of Trump's transactional worldview, the United States gives, Israel takes, and the Gulf pays—and pays well. Israel is an expensive dependent: the war in Gaza has cost Washington more than $22 billion while taxing the American military and bringing the United States into the fight with Iran. The confrontation with Yemen's Houthi rebels—who imposed a blockade on ships headed to Israel, in solidarity with the Palestinians—has tied down the U.S. Navy and required the use of munitions costing over $1 billion, leading Trump to reach a cease-fire of sorts with the Houthis without even consulting Israel.

Trump is clearly frustrated with the status quo, and as for his predecessors, the most easily available policy gambit he could choose would be a symbolic move that reaffirms a two-state solution but does not truly produce one. The Gulf states, the Europeans, and many other players will tell him that a Gaza cease-fire, while desperately needed, is not enough. Even if a cease-fire takes hold, it's unlikely to lead to a permanent end to the war. As even many hawkish Israelis have come to accept, the Israeli military will not be able to destroy Hamas. Thus, the only way to terminate the war, short of a sea change in Israeli public opinion or leadership, is for the United States to check an expansionist Israeli government that is armed with ruinous American weapons.

With all this in mind, the push for recognition of a Palestinian state should not be dismissed. If a large new wave of countries jointly recognize a state of Palestine, it would serve as a powerful symbol of growing international frustration with Israel's obliteration of Gaza and apartheid-like domination of the West Bank. Much of the world would welcome an alternative to the seemingly inexorable drive toward annihilation and annexation. Recognition would also help anchor the debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in international law and could save Gaza from the full-scale destruction and depopulation threatened by some Israeli government ministers. And it would give the Trump administration leverage that it can use to push for the kind of grand bargain he hopes to broker.

But recognition of de jure Palestinian sovereignty in the absence of real change on the ground would be a trap. Recognition cannot be an end unto itself. If many countries choose to recognize Palestine but fail to confront the reality of escalating Israeli domination of the occupied territories, recognition could prove seriously counterproductive. If formal recognition becomes a substitute for defending the primacy of international law and addressing the core realities of Palestinian suffering, it would be at best a hollow gesture—and at worst an epic misallocation of scarce international political capital.

The push for recognition of the state of Palestine has a long history. The UN General Assembly admitted Palestine as a nonvoting member in 2012. Although this did not meaningfully advance Palestinian independence or sovereignty, it allowed Palestine to become a state party to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and to expand its diplomatic efforts within UN institutions. Recognition also inherently bolsters the flagging ideal of a two-state solution and reinforces the principle that Israeli control of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem is illegal and that “Israel is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible,” as the International Court of Justice put it in a sweeping ruling last year.

Recognition has become an attractive option as anger at the horrors of Gaza has built pressure for some form of meaningful international action. Recognition of Palestine by European countries, in particular, would represent a major setback for Israeli diplomacy, given Israel's ferocious lobbying to shore up Western support for its policies and to hold off critics around the world. If wealthy and influential European countries joined the roster of states recognizing Palestine, it would signal a crumbling of Israel's firewall against meaningful international pressure and leave it even more dependent on an unpredictable United States.

Recognition would also be an accomplishment for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Before Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel launched its retaliatory war in Gaza, the Saudi leader had hoped to normalize relations with Israel. He has since stepped back from that goal in the midst of popular outrage in Arab countries over Israel's campaign. Linking recognition of a Palestinian state (and presumably, Saudi Arabia's own normalization with Israel) to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative would give MBS a strong claim to regional leadership. It would also be an opportunity for the Saudis to one-up their rivals in the United Arab Emirates, which agreed to decouple the issue of a Palestinian state from its strategic relations with Israel by signing the Abraham Accords during the previous Trump administration.



Many countries already recognize Palestine as a state, but a new wave of recognitions could well trigger a cascade of global support. Proponents believe widespread recognition could put new pressure on Israel to commit to a two-state outcome by strengthening the voices of Israeli supporters of an independent Palestinian state, who have been silenced in recent years, and give Palestinians a way out of their current impasse. In this view, recognition could also represent a focal point for the enormous groundswell of outrage over Gaza to do something tangible. It might cause Netanyahu's coalition to collapse and galvanize desperately needed political change in Israel. And given the enormous resources that would have to be mustered to rebuild Gaza and devastated parts of the West Bank, donors would likely be more willing to put up the funds as part of a path to an endgame.

Belief in such an outcome, however, requires what might be charitably described as a leap of faith. It has been many years since a two-state solution seemed viable, and the prospects have further diminished in the past 19 months. The situation on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank make territorial division and peaceful coexistence ever more difficult to imagine. Few Israelis today disagree with the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tzipi Hotovely, who bluntly asserted last month that “the two-state solution is over.”

That was arguably true long before Hamas's attack on Israel in 2023 and the war that followed. “All the territory west of the Jordan River has long constituted a single state under Israeli rule, where the land and the people are subject to radically different legal regimes, and Palestinians are permanently treated as a lower caste,” we and two co-authors argued in Foreign Affairs months before October 7. Israel's assault on Gaza has further entrenched this apartheid-like one-state reality as Israeli officials push toward permanent occupation and even annexation of Palestinian territory. As Gaza has become uninhabitable, more destruction and homelessness have been visited on the West Bank and the construction of Israeli settlements there has accelerated.

Given these conditions, recognition of Palestine could be seen as little more than a dodge: a way to make a statement without doing anything to make a change. It is far easier to call for a two-state solution than it is to confront the reality of Israeli domination of a de facto single state. It is easier to affirm the existence of a Palestinian state than to do the extraordinarily difficult things it would take to truly create one. To be more than an empty gesture, the conference must attach demands for concrete changes on the ground to match Palestine's new legal status. The affirmation of Palestinian sovereignty must also spell out the costs for continued Israeli violations of international law, offer protections for Palestinians from further depredations, and lay out steps for building governing institutions and a viable economy from the rubble Israel leaves behind.

It is no surprise that the Trump administration has opposed the UN conference. Trump himself is highly unlikely to be moved by appeals to international law; he recently issued an executive order sanctioning four judges of the ICC for their investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes in the Palestinian territories. And when it comes to Israel, Trump is hardly an outlier among American presidents: for decades, under successive presidential administrations, U.S. policy has been to offer lip service to a two-state solution while doing everything possible to prevent the application of international law to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

But this is not a normal moment in American or global politics. Trump's willingness to break with tradition and override experts, his affinity for the wealthy Gulf states, and his personal distaste for Netanyahu push Washington in surprising directions. Trump's attack on the ICC, his musings about depopulating and seizing Gaza, and his exploitation of concerns (both genuine and disingenuous) about anti-Semitism to attack American universities all suggest a conventional right-wing, pro-Israeli orientation. But when it comes to the Middle East, Trump can be unpredictable: he surprised observers and even his own supporters by lifting sanctions on Syria's new government and by pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran.

Israel's reliance on American support for its war, and its growing international isolation, has left the country more dependent than ever on Washington. At the same time, Israel finds itself out of step with American policy toward Iran and Syria, and falling out of favor with ordinary Americans, including Republicans under the age of 50. In its relationship with Washington, Israel is perhaps more vulnerable than at any time since the end of the Cold War, when President George H. W. Bush launched an ambitious effort to bring about a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

Trump is thus presented with an unusual opportunity to shake things up. He has already signaled that he believes it is time for Israel's war on Gaza to end and that he views action on the Palestinian issue as connected to his diplomacy with Iran and partnership with the Gulf states. He shows little sign of viewing the American relationship with Israel as somehow more special than Washington's relations with any other country. He has centralized decision-making in the White House and banished the bureaucratic expertise that ordinarily keeps policy locked onto a single track. And his controversial domestic policies show that he cares little about political pushback at home.

Taking ownership of a renewed global push to recognize the state of Palestine and make it a reality on the ground would be the kind of dramatic reversal that perhaps only a leader as unconstrained by traditional political considerations and as personally mercurial as Trump could pull off. It's unlikely to happen. And it would not alone be enough. But recognizing Palestine and forcing an end to the war in Gaza represents Trump's best path to forging a new nuclear agreement with Iran, consolidating U.S. partnerships in the Gulf, and proving that he really can do better on foreign policy than his predecessors did.

We are living in the age of economic statecraft. In just two decades, the world's leading powers—above all, the United States—have shifted from using economic pressure sparingly to making it a default feature of foreign policy. As a result, the practice of economic coercion—sanctions, export controls, tariffs, and investment restrictions—has proliferated at breathtaking speed. Since 2000, the number of sanctioned individuals and entities worldwide has increased tenfold. Tariffs and trade barriers have quintupled globally in just five years. More than 90 percent of advanced economies now screen foreign investment in sensitive sectors, up from less than one-third a decade ago. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the United States and its allies froze more than $300 billion of the foreign reserves held by Russia's central bank in G-7 jurisdictions—crossing financial boundaries once considered sacrosanct.

Indeed, more than three years later, it is clear that Pandora's box has been opened. In its first hundred days, the current Trump administration attempted to enact tariffs with a speed and breadth unmatched in modern history. Beijing responded by imposing controls on key minerals exports and telegraphing its capacity to throttle supply chains across strategic sectors, underscoring the reality that economic warfare is no longer the exception. It is now the main arena of great-power competition.

Yet economic statecraft holds both power and peril. Unbridled economic coercion can fracture global markets, entrench rivalry between blocs, and breed instability that risks triggering the very kinetic conflicts it aims to avoid. Despite these risks, no U.S. government doctrine has yet emerged to guide economic statecraft, nor are there institutional safeguards to protect against its abuses. The use of military force, by contrast, has strict and long-established rules of engagement and escalation. Economic force deserves the same, or else policymakers risk deploying it without discipline or legitimacy. If the United States is to maintain its unique leadership role in the global economy, it must clearly define the objectives of economic statecraft, create the institutional capacity to match that mission, and embrace a more positive vision for the use of economic tools.

Several structural forces are driving states to rely more heavily on coercive economic statecraft. Perhaps the simplest to understand is geopolitical: the post–Cold War unipolar moment has given way to rivalry. Yet because most major powers possess nuclear weapons, the logic of mutually assured destruction has channeled direct conflict—most notably between Russia and the West, and between China and the United States—away from the battlefield and into economic domains.

At the same time, democracies—including the United States, where political polarization has reached its highest level in over a century—are fracturing from within. As the political center weakens, leaders from both parties increasingly resort to economic tools for immediate political gain. The Biden administration's early 2025 intervention to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel illustrates this trend: prioritizing domestic ownership in a critical sector over partnership with a trusted ally to build long-term resilience.

Rapid innovation in dual-use technologies—semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, synthetic biology, and nuclear fusion—is also reshaping how countries achieve both economic growth and military strength. These innovations' potential to transform the global balance of power is accelerating countries' efforts to wall off technology ecosystems and weaponize chokepoints in supply chains. China, for example, is simultaneously investing to achieve dominant scale in key dual-use technologies while tightening control over exports of essential inputs such as rare earths, gallium, and germanium. Its goals are to cement its technological advantage and to increase global dependence on Chinese production.

As energy demand soars—driven by AI, electrification, and the expanding middle class—the world's energy supply is also struggling to keep pace amid regulatory and political constraints. That scarcity and uncertainty provides opportunities for energy-rich states to exploit bottlenecks to their geopolitical advantage. Russia, for example, curtailed its natural gas exports to Europe to pressure governments to trim their sanctions and delay military aid to Ukraine. China, which controls more than 70 percent of the supply chain for battery materials, has restricted exports of graphite and signaled that it could extend controls to other minerals essential for electrification.

These mutually reinforcing trends have dramatically increased the demand for economic weaponry. And the opportunities to wield such weapons have rarely been more abundant. Although the era of hyperglobalization has passed its peak, global flows in trade, capital, and technology transfers remain near historic highs—offering countries an ample variety of economic links to sever.

Unsurprisingly, governments are rapidly building administrative capacity, not only to deploy economic weapons but also to shield themselves from their effects. China has constructed the bureaucratic machinery to blacklist foreign companies, orchestrate mass consumer boycotts, and develop payment systems that bypass the dollar. Russia is aiming to perfect sanctions evasion through its use of cryptocurrency, barter arrangements, and gray-market networks. Japan has established a cabinet-level economic security ministry. The European Union is developing new anti-coercion tools. And India has embedded an economic security function within its National Security Council. Economic statecraft is no longer a boutique function of finance ministries. It is now a central pillar of national strategy worldwide.

Yet the more commonplace economic statecraft becomes, the greater the risk that it will spiral out of control. The world is on the cusp of entering a destructive cycle in which every foreign policy challenge triggers a sanction, a tariff, or an export control, fueling rounds of escalation with no clear off-ramps. The United States faces a distinctive test to sustain the legitimacy of the global economic order it built, anchored in the primacy of the dollar-based financial system. This architecture confers immense advantages for the United States: lower borrowing costs for households and businesses, unmatched fiscal capacity to absorb economic shocks, greater resilience in times of global stress, and the power to project force through economic statecraft.

If left improvisational, U.S. economic statecraft will not only erode its own credibility but also intensify global efforts to dilute American economic dominance. China is already spearheading mBridge, a multi-central-bank digital currency platform that aims to settle trade directly in digital yuan and other currencies. The central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates are already using mBridge, with dozens more countries expressing interest. Its success could accelerate efforts to bypass the dollar entirely, making U.S. sanctions and export controls less effective and splintering the world's existing economic interdependence into rival financial blocs.

Against this backdrop, the United States must articulate—at the highest levels of government—a set of guiding principles and rules of engagement for why, when, how, and against whom punitive economic measures are deployed. Although the United States will, at times, want to use restrictive economic tools with overwhelming force, it should do so sparingly. Their implementation should be tethered to clearly defined and achievable geopolitical objectives. Before deploying such measures, policymakers should articulate their strategic aims, including the specific behavior they are penalizing and the outcomes they expect to accomplish when economic pressure is combined with military, diplomatic, or humanitarian levers. This approach can ensure that instruments of economic coercion would remain what they should be: force multipliers, not a strategy unto themselves. Consider the U.S. “maximum pressure” campaign on Venezuela, which aimed to force regime change by cutting off the Maduro regime's access to oil revenues and global financial markets. Lacking a credible diplomatic pathway for leadership transition, the strategy triggered economic collapse without political change—fueling humanitarian catastrophe and mass migration and opening space for Russian and Chinese influence.

The application of economic pressure also demands careful calibration. Measures should be proportionate to their anticipated impact and mindful of spillover effects. In every case, they must exceed a threshold of expected efficacy relative to the costs and risks involved. Practitioners of coercive statecraft have a responsibility to minimize unnecessary harm to civilians and third countries; to avoid targeting food, medicine, or humanitarian goods; and to refrain from seizing private property without due process. The sweeping sanctions that the UN imposed on Iraq in the 1990s—which were so broad that they effectively restricted access to food, medicine, and critical infrastructure—offer a stark warning. Rather than forcing compliance, the measures produced devastating humanitarian suffering, eroded international support for the sanctions, and provided the Iraqi regime with propaganda that undermined the legitimacy of the entire effort.

Economic weapons' effectiveness ultimately hinges on how much they influence the behavior of the targeted actors, not how few unwanted side effects they cause. Sanctions experts excel at designing measures that disrupt economies and financial systems with minimal collateral damage—a necessary capability. But the strategic question that policymakers must consider is whether the punishments will meaningfully shift the calculus of key decision-makers in the targeted country or entity. Meeting this test of sufficiency requires integrating economic analysis with political intelligence. Yet all too often, there is no precise judgment about how much economic pain is required to compel a change in behavior, or whether such a shift is feasible at all—especially when dealing with autocrats such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who may pursue territorial conquest regardless of the economic costs. Policymakers should also weigh timing and signaling carefully: whether to deploy economic weapons preemptively or reactively and whether to communicate their intentions openly or preserve ambiguity to maximize impact.



Coordination with allies is equally essential. Aligning restrictive measures amplifies their power, reduces opportunities for evasion, and reinforces their legitimacy. The purpose of coercive statecraft, after all, should not be the unilateral exercise of brute force but the collective defense of principles that sustain peace and security. Washington's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 and its unilateral reimposition of sanctions—even as European allies remained committed to the deal—illustrated the costs of going it alone. The move sowed legal confusion, stoked transatlantic tension, and diminished the United States' credibility, underscoring how effective economic statecraft depends on building unity and a sense of shared purpose.

Even the most carefully designed measures, however, are blunt tools that are typically deployed amid profound uncertainty. Flexibility and humility, therefore, must be foundational to any doctrine of economic statecraft. It should surprise no one when the impacts diverge from expectations. Humility demands that policymakers acknowledge miscalculations and adjust accordingly. Indeed, even without miscalculation, the context will inevitably shift: the coalition implementing sanctions may expand or contract, economic conditions in the target country may improve or deteriorate, and the political dynamics may evolve in ways that demand reassessment and recalibration.

A good example of adaptive sanctions policy came in 2018 when the United States imposed measures on Rusal, a major aluminum producer linked to the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. After the sanctions triggered severe disruptions in global aluminum markets, the Treasury Department issued a series of general licenses to delay enforcement, ultimately lifting the sanctions once the company's ownership structure was reformed. This recalibration balanced pressure on the target with protection of broader economic interests—a model of flexibility that should inform future policy design.

Finally, doctrine cannot stop at America's shores. The United States should lead the development of an international framework based on these principles—a kind of Geneva Conventions for economic statecraft. This would not be an exercise in idealism but a pragmatic recognition that unchecked economic coercion invites reciprocal harm and risks accelerating the breakdown of the global economic system into competing spheres of influence. Persuading countries such as Japan and India—each investing heavily in their own economic statecraft—to join would require the United States to lead not with dominance but with diplomacy and a willingness to codify constraints on its own power. Other countries' participation would depend on seeing the framework as a source of stability and reciprocity, not hierarchy. Although rivals such as China and Russia may be reluctant to join initially, a credible, coalition-based architecture would still serve to align democratic economies around shared principles and build pressure against the excessive or abusive use of coercive economic tools. As with previous rule-setting efforts, early alignment among trusted partners can establish norms that eventually shape broader global behavior. Without such a framework, the alternative is an escalating cycle of economic brinkmanship that undermines the system that has long anchored U.S. leadership and global prosperity.

Upholding these principles will require a significant upgrade in the U.S. government's institutional capacity. The use of restrictive economic tools must be treated not as ad hoc responses but as part of a disciplined, well-resourced strategic arsenal. That means building analytical infrastructure capable of simulating complex economic interactions—ranging from evasion and retaliation by targets to feedback loops, unintended spillovers, and macroeconomic policy responses—using frameworks akin to multiplayer, multistage game theory. These models must account for various potential outcomes: the diversion of sanctioned goods through third countries, the ripple effects of secondary sanctions on allied economies, adversaries' retaliation with export restrictions in critical sectors, and the capacity for the United States to compensate for import shortfalls with domestic supply.

Just as the Federal Reserve takes regular inventory of its policy instruments and stress tests their effectiveness under varied conditions, the U.S. government should also maintain a continuously updated assessment of the full variety of restrictive measures at its disposal. This assessment should include regular evaluations of each tool's operational readiness, likely effectiveness, and limitations. For example, policymakers should be able to gauge not only whether a particular export control will impair an adversary's technological capacity but also how quickly alternative suppliers or domestic substitutes might emerge. The assessment should be able to consider prospective analyses of where America's economic strengths—such as its dominance in global finance, its cutting-edge technologies, its energy production, and its consumer demand—intersect with adversaries' vulnerabilities, and where adversaries in turn hold leverage over the United States and its allies.

To bring strategic coherence to this work, the United States may need to establish a new Department of Economic Security, staffed with experts in macroeconomics, trade policy, technology, finance, energy, diplomacy, and international law. This institution could function as an operational hub with the scale, analytical muscle, and surge capacity to manage multiple crises simultaneously. Although it may be possible to build these capabilities within the Treasury Department, the reality is that no existing agency today has the mandate, authority, or interdisciplinary expertise to design and deploy economic tools across the full spectrum of national security challenges. Ad hoc task forces and interagency processes have often proved too slow, siloed, or reactive to match the pace of today's geoeconomic threats. When Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended European energy flows and triggered a scramble for alternative suppliers, for example, or when U.S. export controls on advanced chips reverberated through tech supply chains from Taiwan to the Netherlands, it became clear that the United States needs enhanced operational preparedness to anticipate and manage the ripple effects of its economic decisions. A dedicated department would institutionalize economic statecraft as a core pillar of national power—on par with defense, intelligence, and diplomacy—and give it the strategic focus and executional capacity it currently lacks.

Enhancing institutional capacity can't stop at sharpening the tools of economic coercion; it must also support the design and delivery of positive economic tools. No matter how credible the doctrine or rigorous the analysis behind them, restrictive measures alone will never tap into America's most enduring advantages—its ability to attract, inspire, and create.

Currently, the United States suffers from a competitive disadvantage in that many of the innovations with the greatest strategic value—such as advanced semiconductor manufacturing, next-generation batteries, and biomanufacturing—require long investment horizons, high risk tolerance, and substantial upfront capital outlays. These are not the kinds of investments that U.S. private markets, which chase quarterly returns, prefer to make. The same funding deficit appears in old-economy sectors critical to U.S. economic and national security, such as shipbuilding, mining, and port equipment manufacturing. China, by contrast, is advancing a comprehensive strategy combining subsidies, preferential lending, public procurement, and export restrictions to secure dominance in these sectors and to exploit its control over key nodes in global production chains.

Large-scale financing remains elusive in the United States because public-sector leaders generally lack the flexibility to compensate for the private sector's short-termism. In 2022, the Biden administration created the Office of Strategic Capital within the Department of Defense to help channel long-term investment into defense-relevant emerging technologies, but it is authorized to offer loans and guarantees only for narrowly defined projects. For the United States to compete more effectively, it needs to ignite innovation in breakthrough technologies and rebuild strategic scale across the full scope of critical supply chains. This requires a flexible investment authority such as a sovereign wealth fund; concessional lending tools designed to “de-risk” investment and crowd in private capital; and the capacity to proactively secure essential energy and technology inputs—ideally through a Strategic Resilience Reserve that reimagines the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for a broader set of twenty-first-century vulnerabilities.

In a contested world, the United States must be able to marshal both economic sticks and economic carrots. The first step is to articulate a doctrine for how, when, and why coercive tools are used. The second is to build the institutional muscle to deploy them with foresight. The third—and perhaps most vital—is to ensure that U.S. economic power is not guided by brute force but instead reflects a principled ambition to advance resilience at home, opportunity abroad, and innovations that shape a more free and secure world. If the United States leads in defining a global framework rooted in these values, it can renew the legitimacy of the economic order it created—and avert a dangerous unraveling of the international system that would leave all nations diminished, none more than itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A tropical system could form in the Gulf. It could also be the next big flood","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/weather/storm-dexter-gulf-flooding-climate","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:10:00 GMT","


            There's growing concern for another significant rain and flooding event this week, this time along the Gulf Coast, from what could become the Atlantic basin's next tropical system.
    


            The potential storm's flood threat is just the latest in what has been a summer full of deadly and devastating floods.
    


            Right now, the would-be storm is a broad area of showers and thunderstorms off the east coast of Florida. It will drift west across Florida Tuesday, raising the flood threat there, and into the Gulf by midweek where it has a medium chance of becoming a tropical depression, according to the National Hurricane Center.
    


            If it can muster a more defined center of circulation and strengthen further it would become Dexter, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season — a mark typically reached around mid-August.
    


            If it does form, it would do so just off the Gulf Coast — a reminder that storms are more likely to form in the warm, shallow water closer to land in July. Warm water acts like fuel for storms to form and strengthen and ocean surface temperatures are well above average where the system is expected to track.
    


            Conditions aren't looking favorable for a strong storm right now because this system will likely not have much time to mature over water and will also have to overcome hostile upper-level winds that can rip apart storms.
    


            But a few reputable forecast models are predicting a more organized system, potentially a tropical storm, in the Gulf by late week. The outcome could hinge on the system's track. If it dips further south and spends more time over the Gulf it could become stronger if it can withstand the upper-level winds on its journey.
    


            Even if it isn't named, this system will bring tropical downpours to Florida and parts of the Gulf Coast over the next several days.
    


            There's a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain in parts of the Florida Peninsula including Tampa and Orlando Tuesday as the system taps into rich tropical moisture and enhances rainfall rates and the flood potential. The most intense storms are likely in the afternoon and evening as the system drifts across the state. Rainfall totals could range between 3 to 5 inches.
    


            But the most serious flood threat will come later this week and into the weekend as the system drifts west into parts of the north-central Gulf Coast, including Alabama, Mississippi and southeast Louisiana.
    


            Rain chances increase midweek across the north-central Gulf Coast, including Alabama, Mississippi and southeast Louisiana. Heavy rain could be long-lasting once it begins, possibly as soon as Wednesday night.
    


            Flash flooding is the main concern, especially if rain bands repeatedly track over the same areas which could happen if the system moves slowly and lingers.
    


            A Level 2 of 4 threat for flooding rain is in place Thursday for southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans and parts of coastal Alabama and Mississippi. By Friday, the threat increases to a Level 3 of 4 for parts of Louisiana including Baton Rouge over fears that heavy rain could linger. Several inches of rain are possible in the worst-case scenarios.
    


            It's clear that heavy rain and flooding will threaten much of the north-central Gulf Coast, but exactly where and how much remain in question. It will all depend on how strong the system becomes, where it tracks and how fast it moves – questions that will become sorted in the next couple of days.

            Two research analysts made waves last week when they called for a major shakeup at tech giant Apple.
    


            The analysts weren't suggesting a logo or product redesign. Instead, they called for the replacement of Tim Cook, the CEO who directly succeeded Steve Jobs in 2011 and helped catapult the company to its $3 trillion valuation.
    


            Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone of LightShed Partners, a New York-based technology, media and telecommunications research firm, are questioning whether Cook is still the right person to lead one of the world's most valuable companies amid concerns that it's fallen behind in AI — a technology that's already disrupting work, education and other facets of everyday life. Apple has already faced pressure to come up with a new hit product as sales of smartphones, Apple's biggest revenue driver, have slowed across the industry.
    


            “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics,” the pair wrote on July 9.
    


            Replacing Cook would be a high-stakes move for Apple; the company is already undergoing leadership changes elsewhere in the C-suite, and changing CEOs could further pull focus away from running Apple's core business. Cook is also widely supported by Apple's board and has “staying power akin to other captains of industry” such as Disney's Bob Iger and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, reports Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has long tracked Apple's business strategy.
    


            There's no evidence to indicate Cook is going anywhere soon. Shares of Apple (AAPL) have skyrocketed under Cook's tenure, during which he's also built other lucrative products after the iPhone's success — such as smartwatches, earbuds and digital services.
    


            To be sure, the LightShed note is just one take in a crowded field of analysts and researchers who follow Apple's business. But it is perhaps an indication that Apple's AI setbacks are bigger than a standard product delay — to some, they're shaking confidence in Apple's ability to innovate. And Piecyk and Galone aren't the only ones questioning whether Apple needs fresh leadership.
    


            “He's a supply chain guy. They need a tech visionary,” said Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “I think they're in a lot more trouble than some people think.”
    


            Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Apple has grappled with a litany of challenges so far in 2025, among them: President Donald Trump's tariff threats; fresh restrictions from the European Union on how it runs its valuable App Store; and a federal judge allowing an antitrust lawsuit alleging it has monopolized the smartphone market to proceed.
    


            But concerns about the iPhone maker's slow progress in AI have been front and center.
    


            The company in March said it's delaying a long-awaited update to Siri that would have enabled it to answer more complex questions with personalized answers and handle tasks on a user's behalf. That type of change would bring Siri closer to more modern AI agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.
    


            The company hasn't said much about when the revamped Siri will arrive aside from needing “more time to reach our high-quality bar,” Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said in June at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference.
    


            The concern is broader than Siri alone, it's that Apple doesn't seem to have much to show for its AI efforts so far, Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin told CNN earlier this year. Apple has shaken up its AI leadership in an effort to accelerate its efforts in the space, according to Bloomberg.



            Apple Intelligence, which arrived in 2024 following the iPhone 16's September launch, includes tools that can summarize notifications, transcribe phone calls, erase objects in photos, and use an iPhone's camera to search Google or prompt ChatGPT and create images.
    


            Although Apple delayed the Siri update, it did announce a batch of new AI features coming this fall, including live-language translation, AI-generated workout insights for the Apple Watch and enhancements to existing features.
    


            But many of these upgrades are Apple playing catch-up to tools already offered by other tech companies, and may not be enough to position Apple as a leader.
    


            “(Cook) has done a great job of getting Apple to where it is, but the environment certainly has changed,” said Thomas Martin, partner and senior portfolio manager at investment firm Globalt. “They are really struggling on the AI front. It's a different animal, because AI is software, and Apple is traditionally almost exclusively hardware.”
    


            Under Cook's watch, other high-profile products or projects have fallen short of expectations in recent years.
    


            Last year, Apple launched the $3,500 Vision Pro headset, heralding it as the future of computing. But more than a year on, it remains a niche, novelty device as some of Apple's competitors are moving ahead with more stylish and practical augmented reality glasses.
    


            Also in 2024, Apple reportedly ended a decade-long effort to build an electric car, known internally as Project Titan, pulling the plug on what was believed to be an ambitious, expensive endeavor.
    


            Apple has made other significant changes to its leadership. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri was replaced at the start of 2025, although he remains vice president of corporate services according to Apple's website. And the company announced that longtime Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will leave the post this month and retire this year.
    


            Cook, 64, has been Apple's CEO for nearly 14 years and is widely respected for his operational acumen. He stepped out of the shadow of one of America's most iconic CEOs, Steve Jobs, and built a global supply chain and ecosystem of products and services that maintained Apple's place as one of the world's most valuable companies.
    


            He also carved out an important role for Apple in the digital health space with the Apple Watch, which was introduced in 2014 and was the first major new product launched under Cook's tenure. Apple is now a market leader in wearable technology, which includes both the Apple Watch and other devices like its AirPods — it claimed nearly a quarter of the global market for wearables as of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to market research firm the International Data Corporation.
    


            Under Cook's leadership, Apple's market cap went from just over $342 billion in August 2011 to roughly $3 trillion today. Even the two LightShed Partners analysts have acknowledged that Cook has done “a great job.”
    


            “To be clear, Tim Cook was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” the analysts wrote.
    


            And further change to Apple's executive ranks might hinder their efforts to expand in AI.
    


            “I think the last thing you want to do is further rock the boat by putting Tim Cook's job on the line,” said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. “I don't think Apple would even consider doing that.”
    


            He added that while it's clear Apple isn't moving fast enough in AI, “getting rid of Tim Cook” may not be the answer.
    


            Instead, the company could address its AI challenges with an acquisition — the company has reportedly discussed buying AI startup Perplexity — or by deepening its partnership with OpenAI, or following in Meta's footsteps by investing more heavily in top talent, Zino said.
    


            It's rare for any company to keep a CEO for more than 10 years, says William Klepper, academic director in executive education at Columbia Business School and author of the book “The CEO's Boss: Tough Love in the Boardroom.”
    


            “Organizations go up and down, right? It's just this nature of what we call the cycle of business,” he said. “And where they are now is in what I would call kind of a static state.”
    


            Keppler notes that the 10-year time frame isn't random. It usually coincides with a major disruptor that alters a company's business model, which in this case is AI. During those periods of change, companies like Apple need to support their core business while simultaneously adapting to what is coming next.
    


            “From my research and my model, you need a change agent … because you got to start a second wave,” he said. “You can't stay in an executive leadership role when you're at a point of inflection and need to change.”
    


            Companies usually install new CEOs for three reasons: in response to a scandal, to fix a crisis or over a loss of trust and competence, says Sandra Sucher, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. None of those scenarios apply to Cook or Apple.
    


            But one thing's clear: Pressure is mounting on Apple to figure it out –— and fast.
    


            “Do we have an Intel-ing of Apple?” said Martin, referring to the once-leading American chipmaker that fell far behind rivals like Nvidia and AMD after missing several major technology waves.
    


            “That would be so sad.”

            These days, travel between the harbor cities of Hong Kong and Macao takes an hour by high-speed ferry. But from 1948 to 1961, when the two were still colonies of European powers, wealthy tourists could opt for a brief trip by air.
    


            Miss Macao was not a beauty queen. She was a Consolidated Model 28 Catalina seaplane that whisked travelers from Portuguese-controlled Macao to British-controlled Hong Kong, a 20-minute trip. These jaunts were called “cigarette flights,” since the duration was about the length of time needed to smoke one — and you could, since there were no rules against smoking on planes.
    


            Back then, getting on a plane “was like taking a bus,” says Dan Porat, a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. If they could afford it, passengers could buy their tickets as they boarded the plane, with no need to book in advance.
    


            The Macau Air Transport Company, a now-defunct branch of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific flagship airline, operated two of these Catalina “flying boats.” As Macao didn't have an airport or land cleared for a runway, the planes could take off from its coastal waters.
    


            Flying became a popular option for businessmen going between the two cities, especially those who were bringing in items like gold, since Macao was the only open gold market in East Asia at the time.

25 years on: Remembering the glory days of Hong Kong's old Kai Tak Airport



            But then, on July 16, 1948, Miss Macao failed to arrive at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport. Officials in Hong Kong quickly sounded the alarm, and local police began searching the waters between the two cities.



            The only survivor, a 24-year-old Chinese rice farmer named Wong Yu, was rescued by a fisherman and taken to the hospital in Macao. According to multiple news reports at the time, one of Wong's legs was broken, and he was wearing a life jacket he'd managed to grab as the plane descended.
    


            Although Wong claimed to be an ordinary passenger and explained that the plane had exploded in midair, inconsistencies in his story and his questionable behavior — including trying to escape from the hospital — led authorities and the press to a different explanation: The Miss Macao crashed into the sea while being taken over by “air pirates,” an incident that the China Mail, a Hong Kong English-language newspaper, called “unparalleled in the history of aviation.”
    


            On the day it last took off, Miss Macao had two pilots in the cockpit: American captain Dale Cramer and Australian first officer Ken McDuff, both former military airmen. In total, there were 27 people on board: along with 24 passengers, there was a single flight attendant, Delca da Costa, a Portuguese national from Macao who was also McDuff's girlfriend.
    


            Four of the passengers, though, had no intention of going to Hong Kong. In a confession, Wong said that he and three fellow would-be thieves had sold everything they owned to buy the tickets, figuring that the proceeds from the crime would be worth it.
    


            As historian Luis Andrade de Sa explains in his book “Aviation in Macau: One Hundred Years of Adventure,” shortly after the plane took off from Macao, the four hijackers quickly sprang into action, with one storming into the cockpit and demanding that the pilots surrender control of the aircraft.
    


            According to multiple historical accounts, the lead hijacker, Chiu Tok, had taken flying lessons in Manila and planned to take over captaining the plane once the pilots were subdued.
    


            However, he hadn't anticipated that Cramer would refuse to let go of the controls, nor that there would be resistance in the main cabin. As one passenger tussled with a hijacker, a gun went off. McDuff swung at Chiu Tok with an iron bar. The hijackers shot both pilots, and Cramer's body landed on the plane's joystick control, sending the aircraft plummeting into the South China Sea.
    


            An August 1948 article in Time magazine described the scene in colorful language, writing that the four hijackers “looked hungrily” at the rich passengers they were targeting.
    


            Wong was picked up by a local boat and treated for his injuries. His story about surviving a midair explosion was quickly disproven when pieces of Miss Macao's wreckage were recovered, punctured by bullet holes.
    


            Getting the true account of events out of Wong wouldn't be easy. He was in poor physical and mental health, so police were reluctant to use harsh interrogation. Instead, they came up with an unorthodox plan: they filled the hospital with sleeper agents. Dozens of Chinese-speaking undercover police officers posing as patients were tasked with befriending Wong, and they eventually got him to admit what really happened on board Miss Macao.
    


            He confessed that the plan had been for the hijackers to seize control of the plane and redirect it to a town in Guangdong province in southern China, where the passengers and crew would be robbed of their valuables and then held for ransom.
    


            No one was supposed to die.
    


            The hijacking of the Miss Macao was so novel that no one had ever applied the word “hijacking” to such a situation — press at the time called it “air piracy.”
    


            The concept of scanning passengers with a metal detector before they boarded a plane was still decades away. Only the most cursory of security checks were carried out, with some items of luggage opened and searched.
    


            The hijackers had prepared for that — they'd tied their guns to their legs with black string, and the China Mail newspaper reported at the time that one had hidden bullets in the hollowed-out sole of his shoe.
    


            Although Wong eventually told the full story of what happened on board Miss Macao, there was confusion over how to prosecute him — and who would do it. Portuguese authorities in Macao said that because the plane was owned by a British company, Wong's trial would need to take place in Hong Kong. But because the hijackers were all Chinese, British officials in Hong Kong said the case was not in their jurisdiction either.
    


            Finally, in 1951, Wong was deported from Macao to mainland China, where he died not long after, at the age of 27. He never stood trial for robbery, murder or piracy.

Boeing 747: How the ‘Queen of the Skies' redefined the way we fly



            As for the two former colonial cities, their own air travel industries blossomed in the decades to come.
    


            Hong Kong became one of the world's biggest air hubs as its economy grew in the late 20th century. The city became a financial capital and the gateway to mainland China.
    


            It outgrew Kai Tak Airport, which closed in 1998 and was replaced with the larger Hong Kong International, which is consistently ranked among the best airports in the world.
    


            Meanwhile, Macao International Airport opened in 1995. These days, the airport has a small exhibit about important aviation stories that happened there — including the hijacking of the Miss Macao.
    


            The story of the Hong Kong-Macao hijacking quickly fell out of newspapers. Many people in the nascent commercial aviation industry saw it as a terrible one-off and didn't believe that plane hijacking — or skyjacking as it was called at the peak of its popularity — would become commonplace. There was also a fear that too much coverage of the story would scare off would-be flyers.
    


            When the United States established the Federal Aviation Administration in 1958 to regulate air travel, the legislation made no mention of preventing skyjacking, a sign that it was still not seen as a significant issue. But the social unrest of the years that followed, and the growth and increasing affordability of air travel, changed all that, historians say.
    


            From 1968 to 1972, the airlines went through what became known as the “golden age of hijacking,” a phrase popularized by Brendan I. Koerner in his book “The Skies Belong to Us.”
    


            “Every five and a half days, there was a hijacking,” says Porat, the history professor. “This is the time where the industry is trying to develop. And basically, (hijacking) becomes a threat.”
    


            Some of the incidents followed the same plan as the Miss Macao incident — a group of hijackers would take over the plane, land it in a third location, rob the prisoners, and hold the passengers and/or the plane for ransom.

            Other hijackers claimed political reasons for taking over airplanes, demanding passage to North Vietnam, Algeria or Cuba, all of which were at odds with the United States. It happened the other way in a few cases, too. Individuals from countries behind the Iron Curtain — often members of the flight crew — would demand to be flown to a non-communist nation where they could claim political asylum.
    


            Hijacking became so common that airline head offices kept large amounts of cash on hand in case they needed to fork it over to a would-be hijacker, Koerner explains in his book.
    


            William Landes, a US economist and emeritus professor at the University of Chicago Law School, estimates that during this so-called “golden age,” hijackings cost the aviation industry $219,221 per passenger.
    


            According to Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Porat, the hijacking of a 1968 plane by Palestinian militants was “largely agreed upon in scholarly circles to be the first international act of international terrorism (via) the hijacking of a plane.”
    


            Three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took over El Al Flight 426, which was traveling from Rome to Israel, and diverted the plane to Algeria. The non-Israeli passengers and crew were allowed to leave and board a plane to France, while 40 male Israelis were held for 40 days before being released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
    


            Although everyone on board El Al 426 survived, skyjackings had become too big to ignore. The cost to airlines was astronomical, and industry executives were fed up.
    


            As Koerner puts it, “By the end of 1972, the skyjackers had become so reckless, so dismissive of human life, that the airlines and the federal government had no choice but to turn every airport into a miniature police state.”
    


            Porat agrees. Although there was initially pushback from travelers, there had been enough high-profile hijackings that safety had become a significant concern. And they acquiesced, agreeing to walk through metal detectors, have their luggage X-rayed, and more.
    


            “We're so used to this being searched thing that it's quite incredible,” Porat says.

            In 1970, the UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, a multilateral agreement to proscribe and punish the hijacking of planes, was approved at The Hague.
    


            It called hijackings “a matter of grave concern,” adding that “unlawful acts of seizure or exercise of control of aircraft in flight jeopardize the safety of persons and property, seriously affect the operation of air services, and undermine the confidence of the peoples of the world in the safety of civil aviation.”
    


            In 1971, US President Richard Nixon appointed Lt. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. the country's first — and so far only — “hijacking czar.” Davis wanted to impose strict screening procedures at airports but was met with pushback from the aviation industry, which believed that passengers would balk at the rules and give up on air travel.
    


            Still, in 1973, Nixon introduced mandatory metal detector screenings for all passengers in the United States and X-rays for all bags. And the 9/11 attacks, closely followed by the attempted bombing of a Paris-to-Miami flight with explosives hidden in a shoe, brought on the familiar grueling security checks of today — none of which, for all the industry's fears in the Nixon era, discouraged the public from flying.
    


            What happened on the Miss Macao was not a singular story. It was the first of many aviation incidents that would transform the way humans travel by air. Before “the golden age of hijacking” or the September 11, 2001 attacks, one nearly forgotten seaplane set a new age of aviation into motion.

            China reported better-than-expected economic growth for the second quarter in the face of an ongoing trade war with the United States, as diversification efforts to non-US markets buoyed exports.
    


            Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 5.2% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) at a press conference on Tuesday. That was higher than the average prediction of 5.1%, based on a poll of 40 economists surveyed by Reuters on Friday.
    


            The GDP growth in the second quarter was a slowdown from a 5.4% expansion in the first three months of the year. Together, GDP growth for the first half of the year compared to the same period last year stood at 5.3%, according to the NBS.
    


            Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the NBS, said the growth in the first half of the year was achieved “under the challenging circumstances of rapidly shifting international dynamics and significantly increased external pressure since the second quarter.”
    


            “We are also keenly aware that the external environment remains complex and volatile, internal structural problems have yet to be fundamentally resolved, and the foundation of economic performance still needs to be further strengthened,” he said.
    


            China's economy remains under mounting external and internal pressure to meet its ambitious target of “around 5%” growth set for this year, a goal economists believe will be tough to achieve without further policy support.
    


            US President Donald Trump's tariff offensive – which at one point reached 145% on Chinese imports – has upended what is arguably the world's most consequential bilateral trade relationship. Under a May truce reached in Geneva﻿ that scaled back the triple-digit tariffs, Beijing has less than a month, until August 12, to secure a permanent deal with Washington.
    


            For China's export-reliant economy, much hinges on the tariff rate ultimately agreed upon. Even a double-digit levy would carry profound and lasting implications for Chinese manufacturers – a key pillar of the country's economic engine.
    


            Domestically, the Chinese economy continues to be plagued by a host of structural challenges, including a prolonged property crisis, soaring youth unemployment, sluggish consumption and persistent deflation.
    


            In June, consumer spending fell short of expectations while industrial production exceeded them, according to data released by the NBS Tuesday. Retail sales slowed to 4.8% from the same month last year, compared with 6.4% growth in May. Industrial output expanded 6.8% compared with June last year, an increase from 5.8% last month, likely due to the trade truce.
    


            Meanwhile, the housing market is slowing again, weighing on the economy after a brief recovery following late last year's stimulus, Macquarie Group's chief China economist Larry Hu wrote in a Wednesday research note. Investment in the sector plunged 11.2% in the first six months compared with the same period last year, according to NBS data.
    


            Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNN that while the trade war has dragged on market sentiment, it hasn't emerged as the massive shock to Chinese economic performance that investors initially feared back in April.
    


            With weaknesses in the domestic economy, such as weak consumer confidence and persistent stress in the property sector, however, he expects China to barely undershoot its annual target for this year.
    


            But Marro also cautioned that there is a mismatch between what the GDP figure says and what companies and households are seeing on the ground.
    


            “For many, this doesn't ‘feel' like an economy growing at around 5% – That sentiment factor has implications for how sustainable future retail spending is, as well as considerations for businesses about future investment expansions, as well as hiring and wage growth,” he said.
    


            Despite growth in the first half of the year exceeding the 5% target, economists warned that existing obstacles could weigh on exports and slow economic momentum in the months ahead.
    


            Zichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a Tuesday research note that the economic outlook for the rest of the year remains “challenging.”
    


            “With tariffs set to remain high, fiscal ammunition being depleted and structural headwinds persisting, growth is likely to slow further over the second half,” he said.
    


            In June, China's manufacturers capitalized on the trade truce with the US and diversified their supply routes to achieve a 5.8% growth in overall export compared to the same month in the previous year, beating analysts' forecast, according to trade data released on Monday by China's General Administration of Customs. At the same time, imports edged up 1.1%, marking the first monthly increase in inbound shipments since February.
    


            Notably, exports of rare earth jumped 32% in June from the same month a year ago, signaling positive progress as China agreed to approve the flow of the critical elements essential in everything from electronic products to vehicles and fighter jets following talks in London with the US last month.
    


            Outbound shipments to the US in June declined 16.1% from the same month last year due to persistent trade frictions. But exports last month grew 32% month-on-month following the Geneva agreement. For the first half of the year, exports to the US dropped 9.9% from a year earlier, with second-quarter shipments plummeting nearly 21%.
    


            Southeast Asia in particular has emerged as a major export destination in place of the US. Exports to the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) surged by over 18% compared with June last year. China has increasingly turned to neighboring economies not only as end markets but also as logistical intermediaries, routing goods through countries like Vietnam to circumvent US tariffs — a strategy the Trump Administration has vowed to crack down.
    


            As part of a trade framework the US reached with Vietnam, Trump said he will impose a 40% duty on transshipped imports via Vietnam. Chinese exports to Vietnam rose more than 25% last month compared with June last year.
    


            At a press conference on Thursday, Chinese officials touted how the country has diversified its “circle of friends” with a rise in exports to the European Union, South Korea, Japan in addition to ASEAN in the first half of the year.
    


            Within China, the economy continues to grapple with deflationary pressure, as factory gate deflation, as measured by Producer Price Index (PPI), plunged 3.6% in June from a year earlier, according to NBS data released last week. This marks its sharpest decline in nearly two years, and extends the country's producer deflation streak to 33 consecutive months.
    


            Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a benchmark for measuring inflation, rose 0.1% compared to the same month last year, ending a four-month decline.
    


            Deflation is problematic because it discourages people from spending now, in anticipation of lower prices in the future. This dampens consumption – a key driver of economic growth.
    


            Analysts attributed the uptick in consumer prices to government subsidies on consumer goods, and warned that the recovery may be short-lived as stimulus effects fade.
    


            The persistent deflationary pressure is squeezing business profits and wages, and it has been exacerbated by price wars and overcapacity such as in the auto industry. Authorities have grown increasingly concerned and have urged companies to end aggressive discounting.
    


            In response to the economic malaise and external challenges like tariffs, China's cabinet, the State Council on Wednesday unveiled a slew of measures to “stabilize employment,” including expanding social insurance coverage, subsidies, loan support and vocational training for targeted groups such as youths.
    


            China's urban unemployment rate stood at 5% in June, below the government's annual target of 5.5%, according to the NBS on Tuesday. But youth unemployment remained a major problem.
    


            The unemployment rate for China's working population aged 16 to 24 remained elevated at 14.9% in May, despite falling to its lowest level in nearly a year. The figure for those aged 25 to 29 declined to 7% during the same period.
    


            As part of the new measures announced, the government will disburse a one-off subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan ($209) per person to companies and social organizations that hire unemployed youth aged 16 to 24 and pay for their full insurance for at least three months, the notice said.
    


            The State Council also directed local authorities to provide graduates struggling to find jobs with one-on-one support, including at least three job recommendations. After graduation, those still unemployed would receive continued support like policy briefings, career guidance, job leads, and training or internship opportunities, the notice said.

            Thousands of employees across US federal health agencies received an email Monday afternoon telling them they were out of a job as of the close of business.
    


            The firings were originally communicated April 1 for most of the included employees, but they'd been delayed as a legal battle played out. That culminated in a US Supreme Court decision July 8 that, the US Department of Health and Human Services said in the email, means the agency “is now permitted to move forward with a portion of its [reduction in force].”
    


            “You are hereby notified that you are officially separated from HHS at the close of business on July 14, 2025,” read Monday's notice to dismissed HHS employees, according to copies obtained by CNN. “Thank you for your service to the American people.”
    


            “HHS previously announced our plans to transform this department to Make America Healthy Again and we intend to do just that,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email to CNN after the Supreme Court's ruling last week.
    


            In a reorganization announced March 27, HHS eliminated 10,000 employees across agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health; some have since gotten their jobs back, but the number losing employment Monday is in the thousands, a spokesperson for the agency confirmed.
    


            Some of those 10,000, though, are protected at least temporarily under a different court case, New York v. Kennedy, and are not being separated immediately, the spokesperson said. That includes employees at six units of the CDC — the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; the National Center for Environmental Health; the Division of Reproductive Health; the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; the Office on Smoking and Health; and the National Center for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities — the Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA; the Office of Head Start; and the Division of Data and Technical Analysis under the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
    


            “All employees previously notified on April 1 have been separated, except for those” to whom the temporary protection in New York v. Kennedy applies, the HHS spokesperson said.
    


            In that case, Judge Melissa DuBose of US District Court in Rhode Island granted a preliminary injunction request this month from a coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia to halt the March 27 reorganization plan.
    


            Last week, the administration asked DuBose to narrow her ruling to the divisions cited by the HHS spokesperson, but the judge has yet to rule on that request.
    


HHS reinstates more than 450 CDC employees fired in April reorganization, including childhood lead poisoning team



            The layoffs will probably be challenged in court given that many HHS workers are still protected by DuBose's order, but the agency could argue that the Supreme Court ruling allows it to reduce staff, said Michael Fallings, a managing partner at Tully Rinckey who specializes in federal employment law.
    


            Also Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with mass layoffs at another agency – the Department of Education – for now. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a teachers union, school districts, states and education groups.
    


            Within two hours of that decision, the department sent notices to employees indicating that it's immediately resuming its plans and that the workers would be let go on August 1.
    


            “They seem to be emboldened by the recent Supreme Court decisions that have been green-lighting the Trump administration's actions that other courts have stayed,” said Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at the O'Neill Institute at Georgetown University, of HHS proceeding with the layoffs.
    


            In last week's Supreme Court ruling, the justices allowed federal agencies to proceed with their reduction-in-force, or RIF, plans, putting on hold a lower court order that had temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from taking those steps without approval from Congress.
    


            But the justices noted that “we express no view on the legality of any Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan,” leaving open the possibility that it could rule against a specific agency's layoff plan in the future if the reductions appeared to make it impossible for the department to carry out its obligation under the law.
    


            Filed by a coalition of more than a dozen unions, nonprofits and local governments, that case stemmed from an executive order Trump signed in mid-February that kicked off the process of significantly reducing the size of federal agencies.

            Colorado prosecutors are set to lay out their evidence Tuesday against a man charged with murder, attempted murder and other crimes in a firebomb attack on demonstrators showing their support for Israeli hostages in Gaza.
    


            Investigators say Mohamed Sabry Soliman told them he intended to kill the roughly 20 participants at the weekly demonstration on Boulder's Pearl Street pedestrian mall on June 1. But he threw just two of more than two dozen Molotov cocktails he had with him while yelling, “Free Palestine!” Police said he told them he got scared because he had never hurt anyone before.
    


            Federal authorities say Soliman, an Egyptian national, had been living in the U.S. illegally with his family.
    


            The purpose of Tuesday's preliminary hearing in state court in Boulder is for District Judge Nancy Woodruff Salomone to determine if there's enough evidence for Soliman to go on trial there.
    


Judge ends order blocking deportation of family of man charged in Boulder firebomb attack



            Soliman already faced dozens of charges in state court as well as hate crime charges in federal court when state prosecutors added murder charges following the death of an 82-year-old woman who was injured in the attack died as the result of her injuries. Karen Diamond helped at her synagogue and volunteered for several local groups, including the University of Colorado University Women's Club and a local music festival.
    


            Last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Cramer-Babycz told U.S. District Judge John L. Kane that federal prosecutors have not decided yet whether to file additional charges against Soliman related to Diamond's death.
    


            Federal prosecutors allege the victims were targeted because of their perceived or actual connection to Israel. But Soliman's federal defense lawyers say he should not have been charged with hate crimes because the evidence shows he was motivated by opposition to Zionism, the political movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel.
    


            An attack motivated by someone's political views is not considered a hate crime under federal law.
    


            Soliman has pleaded not guilty to the hate crime charges. He has not been asked to enter a plea to the state charges yet.
    


Judge says hate crime prosecution in Boulder, Colorado, attack can proceed



            State prosecutors have identified 29 people who are considered victims of the attack, including 13 who were physically injured. The others were nearby and are considered victims because they could have been hurt. A dog was also injured in the attack, so Soliman has also been charged with animal cruelty.
    


            Tuesday's hearing was set to move ahead over the objections of Soliman's state public defenders, who asked to delay it after Diamond died and Soliman was charged with murder. In a court filing last week, they said they were not aware of an autopsy report being done for Diamond yet and asked to delay the hearing until October so they would be be able to review “significant medical records” in advance.

The Justice Department and FBI are struggling to contain the fallout from the decision to withhold records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. (AP Video by River Zhang)

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

NEW YORK (AP) — As his supporters erupt over the Justice Department's failure to release much-hyped records in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking investigation, President Donald Trump's strategy has been to downplay the issue.

His problem? That nothing-to-see-here approach doesn't work for those who have learned from him that they must not give up until the government's deepest, darkest secrets are exposed.

Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI abruptly walked back the notion that there's an Epstein client list of elites who participated in the wealthy New York financier's trafficking of underage girls. Trump quickly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi and chided a reporter for daring to ask about the documents.

The online reaction was swift, with followers calling the Republican president “out of touch” and demanding transparency.

On Saturday, Trump used his Truth Social platform to again attempt to call supporters off the Epstein trail amid reports of infighting between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the issue. He suggested the turmoil was undermining his administration — “all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.”

That did little to mollify Trump's supporters, who urged him to release the files or risk losing his base. At least one follower responded to Trump's post by saying it seemed as though the president was just trying to make the issue go away — but assured him it wouldn't.




The political crisis is especially challenging for Trump because it's one of his own making. The president has spent years stoking dark theories and embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda that casts him as the only savior who can demolish the “deep state.”

Now that he's running the federal government, the community he helped build is coming back to haunt him. It's demanding answers he either isn't able to or does not want to provide.

“The faulty assumption Trump and others make is they can peddle conspiracy theories without any blowback,” said Matt Dallek, a political scientist at George Washington University. “The Epstein case is a neat encapsulation that it is hard to put the genie back in the bottle.”

Last week's two-page statement from the Justice Department and the FBI saying they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a client list roiled Trump's supporters, who pointed to past statements from several administration officials that the list ought to be revealed.

Bondi had suggested in February that such a document was sitting on her desk waiting for review, though last week she said she had been referring generally to the Epstein case file and not a specific client list.

Conservative influencers have since demanded to see all the files related to Epstein's crimes, even as Trump has tried to put the issue to bed.

Far-right commentator Jack Posobiec said at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit on Saturday that he would not rest “until we go full Jan. 6 committee on the Jeffrey Epstein files.”

Trump's weekend post sought to divert attention by calling on supporters to focus instead on investigating Democrats and arresting criminals rather than “spending month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein.” His first-term national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, pleaded with him to reconsider.

“@realdonaldtrump please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away,” Flynn wrote, adding that failing to address unanswered Epstein questions would make facing other national challenges “much harder.”

Other Trump allies continue to push for answers, among them far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has called for Bondi to resign. She told Politico's Playbook newsletter on Sunday that a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the handling of the files on Epstein, who was found dead in his federal jail cell in 2019 about a month after he was arrested.

Experts who study conspiracy theories warned that more sunlight does not necessarily make far-fetched narratives disappear.

“For some portion of this set of conspiracy theory believers, no amount of contradictory evidence will ever be enough,” said Josephine Lukito, who studies conspiracy theorists at the University of Texas at Austin. 

The president and many figures in his administration — including Bondi,Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel — earned their political capital over the years in part by encouraging disproven conspiracy theories on a range of topics, from elections to vaccines.

Now, they're tasked with trying to reveal the evidence they'd long insisted was there — a challenge that's reached across the government.

Last week, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted on X what seemed like an endorsement of a notorious conspiracy theory that the contrails left by aircraft are releasing chemicals for potentially nefarious reasons. But a second post from Zeldin underscored the fine line the Trump administration is trying to walk by linking to a new page on the EPA website that essentially debunked the theory.

The value of conspiratorial fabrications is that they help people get political power, said Russell Muirhead, who teaches political science at Dartmouth College. He said Trump has exploited that “more ably than anybody probably in American history.”

But the Epstein case brings unique challenges, he said. That's because it's rooted in truth: A wealthy and well-connected financier did spend years abusing large numbers of young girls while escaping justice.

As a result, Trump needs to come forward with truth and transparency on the topic, Muirhead said. If he doesn't, “large segments of his most enthusiastic and devoted supporters are going to lose faith in him.”

As right-wing outrage over Epstein dominates the political conversation, Democrats and other Trump rivals have been taking advantage.

Several Democratic lawmakers have called for the release of all Epstein files and suggested Trump could be resisting because he or someone close to him is featured in them. Conservatives expressed concerns that Trump's approach on Epstein could hurt them in the midterms.

“For this to go away, you're going to lose 10% of the MAGA movement,” right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon said during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit on Friday.

There's also the challenge of governing.

Bondi and Bongino had a tense exchange last week at the White House over a story about Epstein, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.

And Loomer, who is close to Trump, said Friday she was told that Bongino was “seriously thinking about resigning.” Bongino showed up at work Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues. The FBI declined to comment.

Patel also took to social media Friday to dismiss what he called “conspiracy theories” that he himself would be leaving the administration.

Dallek, the George Washington University professor, said it's alarming that the country's top law enforcement officials are feuding over a conspiracy theory.

“It's possible at some time voters are going to notice the things they want or expect government to do aren't being done because the people in charge are either incompetent or off chasing rabbits,” he said. “Who is fulfilling the mission of the FBI to protect the American people?”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people.

Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do. 

But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans.




“The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov's data,” NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said.

On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said, “All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting.”

“This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments.




Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here.

Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports. 

“The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,” Holdren said. “In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology.”

“They simply don't want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,” Holdren said in an email.

That's why it's important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is “useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment.”

“Trump doesn't want people to know,” Holdren wrote. 

The most recent report, issued in 2023, found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority communities, particularly Native Americans, often disproportionately at risk.

PADANG, Indonesia (AP) — Residents of Indonesia's Mentawai Islands found several people stranded on Monday after a speedboat carrying 18 people capsized during a storm the day before, authorities said. All were in good condition. 

The boat, carrying mostly local administration officials, capsized while on its regular two-hour journey from Sikakap, a town in the Mentawai Islands district in West Sumatra, to the town of Tuapejat, according to Lahmudin, heads of the local Disaster Management Agency, who, like many Indonesians, uses only a single name.

Ten passengers, including three children and a local parliament member, clung to the wreckage and were found on Guluk Guluk beach, while the other was found near the village of Matobe, according to Mentawai Islands district chief, Rinto Wardana. 

Seven, including the two crew members, had managed to reach the Mapinang fishing hamlet, after swimming for hours in the choppy waters, to seek help, Wardana said, adding they survived thanks to their ability to swim.

All survivors were transported to Tuapejat, where their families had been waiting for news.

An investigation is underway, “but survivors said the boat was hit by high waves in a sudden storm,” Lahmudin said.

A rescue ship and an inflatable boat had been deployed for the search, with the assistance of local fishermen and residents, said Rudi, the local search and rescue agency chief who also goes by a single name. 




Videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed the operation taking place overnight in rough seas as rain fell.

Wardana praised the quick response of the joint search and rescue team and community, vowing to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of shipping safety procedures, especially during extreme weather seasons. He also urged boat operators to always pay attention to weather forecast information.

Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands where ferries are a common method of travel. Accidents occur regularly, with weak safety enforcement often blamed.

A ferry sank near Indonesia's resort island of Bali early this month, leaving at least 18 dead and 17 missing after a two-week search operation that involved more than 1,000 rescuers, three navy ships, 15 boats, a helicopter and divers. The search operation officially closed Monday.

Counterterrorism expert Jonathan Gilliam said Iranian sleeper cells might be hiding ""in plain sight"" as Iran has issued threats against America.

A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman confirmed Tuesday that five Iranians were arrested while attempting to illegally cross the U.S. northern border with Canada.

""On July 1, Border Patrol Agents from the Champlain, New York Station, responded to suspicious activity near Mooers Forks, NY,"" CBP's Swanton Sector said on Facebook. ""Agents located a minivan occupied by five citizens of Iran and two citizens of Uzbekistan.""

The Champlain Station is part of the Swanton Sector. Swanton is a rural town in Vermont near Highway 89 just south of the Canadian Border.

MORE IRANIANS WITH CRIMINAL HISTORIES ARRESTED BY ICE IN TRUMP'S SECURITY SWEEP: 'WORST OF THE WORST'

CBP said that all seven men had been previously arrested for attempting to cross the border illegally. All seven aliens are detained and awaiting deportation.

""They are currently detained and pending removal proceedings,"" CBP said. ""Border security is national security and directly correlates to public safety, Swanton Sector Agents remain vigilant and committed to protecting our borders and enforcing immigration laws.""

Earlier this month, a counterterrorism expert told Fox News Digital that Iranian terrorist sleeper cells could be hiding in plain sight. The U.S. military crippled several Iranian nuclear sites after targeted airstrikes on June 22. 

""Where these sleeper cells may be is in plain sight,"" former FBI special agent and terrorism task force member Jonathan Gilliam said. ""And that's the real terrifying part of this is that putting people in place, as we've seen over the past four years, everyone's scrambling because certain amounts of people could come in here and get in here.""

Gilliam pointed to the Biden administration's border policies as a reason for concern.

""They could even go to the border and say they [want to] seek asylum, and the Biden administration, instead of putting them into DHS housing or ICE housing and holding them there so they could have their first appearance. To be vetted and whether or not they get asylum,"" he said. 

In a 2023 terrorism report released by the State Department in December of last year, the federal government outlined numerous instances of worrying behavior by Iranian nationals in western countries. 

""In 2023 the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging three individuals connected with Iran in a plot to assassinate an Iranian dissident in New York City,"" that report said. ""Also in 2023, a United Kingdom court found a man guilty of attempting to collect information for terrorist purposes on the London-based Iran International, a media company that is critical of the Iranian regime.""

This year's event will take place at Bethpage Black outside of New York City. It will be the second time a team competition has been in the tri-state area, along with the 2017 Presidents Cup at Liberty National in Jersey City.

The United States and Europe have alternated winning the Cup, with the home team winning each event, rather convincingly, each year since 2016.

Xander Schauffele has been a part of Team USA for each Ryder and Presidents Cup since 2019, and he currently has an automatic bid as the second-ranked American in the FedEx Cup standings (the top six players get automatic bids).

However, his own dad wants no part of it.

Stefan Schauffele told The London Times that he is ""not going"" to the Ryder Cup in September.

""I'm afraid of what's going to happen in New York. I was there [at Whistling Straits] when they called Shane Lowry's wife a whore in front of him. I couldn't believe my ears,"" Stefan revealed.

Stefan also said he was turned off by the tempers flaring between Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava, in Rome two years ago. 

McIlroy was not happy with LaCava's celebration of a long putt from Cantlay, who opted not to wear a hat in protest of players not being paid to play in the event. This year, U.S. players will receive a $200,000 stipend and another $300,000 to donate to charity.

""That was utterly disgusting claiming this money bulls---, and Rory behaved disgustingly in my opinion,"" Schauffele continued. ""It's only going to get worse. It's ruined my appetite for the Ryder Cup. It becomes unwatchable.""

McIlroy then had to be held back from LaCava in the parking lot after the round.

The rivalry between the two teams is undoubtedly hotter than ever - but apparently, Mr. Schauffele has no interest.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told the young crowd at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit Friday that he is returning the U.S. military to its ""warrior ethos."" 

Secretary Pete Hegseth pulled senior Defense Department officials from the Aspen Security Conference for promoting the ""evil of globalism."" 

Military commanders were set to speak at the conference, which begins on Tuesday, as has been tradition through Republican and Democratic administrations. 

But Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson told Just the News the secretary's office believes the conference ""promotes the evil of globalism, disdain for our great country, and hatred for the President of the United States.""

Wilson added that DoD ""has no interest in legitimizing an organization that has invited former officials who have been the architects of chaos abroad and failure at home.""

The forum will host other Trump administration officials: Adam Boehler, presidential envoy for hostage response, and Tom Barrack, U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Syria. 

It will also hear from some contentious Biden administration officials – Jake Sullivan, former national security advisor, and Brett McGurk, a former National Security Council coordinator.

Mark Esper, Trump's former acting defense secretary, and David Petraeus, who was briefly CIA director under President Barack Obama, will also be speaking, along with Condoleezza Rice, a national security advisor and secretary of state during the Bush years. 

""Senior Department of Defense officials will no longer be participating at the Aspen Security Forum because their values do not align with the values of the DoD,"" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement. 

""The Department will remain strong in its focus to increase the lethality of our warfighters, revitalize the warrior ethos, and project Peace Through Strength on the world stage. It is clear the ASF is not in alignment with these goals.""

The Aspen Institute said in a statement on the Pentagon withdrawal: ""For more than a decade, the Aspen Security Forum has welcomed senior officials – Republican and Democrat, civilian and military – as well as senior foreign officials and experts, who bring experience and diverse perspectives on matters of national security.""

""We will miss the participation of the Pentagon, but our invitations remain open.""

House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, was praised for the role he played in the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. However, the congressman says this is the beginning, not the end, of spending reforms.

""We will never be able to get a balanced budget or even put our country on a path to a balanced budget and a sustainable fiscal trajectory in one reconciliation bill,"" Arrington told Fox News Digital. ""We're too far down the broken road of bad and irresponsible fiscal behavior. We're too deep in the debt hole for one bill to do it.""

Arrington, whom House Speaker Mike Johnson called the ""the lead budget hawk in the House,"" said he is ""obsessed"" with tackling deficit spending, which he sees as the biggest threat to America's future. He believes that addressing the nation's situation in an effective way means creating the ""conditions for growing the economy.""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOWCASE THEY 'TOOK ACTION' WITH PASSAGE OF TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

""So, the pro-growth policies, the tax cuts, the work incentives, opening up our energy assets and deregulating the energy economy, all of those pro- growth policies will reignite economic growth. And that is the foundation for our country's fiscal health and just about everything else: our military prowess, our global leadership, our way of life,"" Arrington said.

The Big Beautiful Bill's journey to President Donald Trump's desk was not pretty, as the legislation received criticism from both sides of the aisle and caused tension among Republicans.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Elon Musk, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and others argued that it did not take adequate measures to cut government spending. Arrington said he respects Massie and Musk — as well as other critics — but believes that the risk of losing the ""good things"" in the bill was too high. In the end, the Texas lawmaker sees the tradeoff as ""permanent pro-growth tax policy"" in exchange for the extra spending in the legislation.

""I think there's a big gap in information — and accurate information. Part of it is you've got the Congressional Budget Office putting out these big numbers… two and a half or three trillion dollars in additional deficit that would be added to the national debt over the 10-year budget window as a result of this bill. That is just patently false. It's completely inaccurate,"" Arrington said, adding that they fail to ""consider economic growth and the revenue that will flow back into the treasury when you have pro-growth policies.""

Trump signed the bill on his self-imposed July 4 deadline, just one day after the House passed the final version of the $3.3 trillion legislation. 

Before signing the bill, the president said it would ""fuel massive economic growth"" and ""lift up the hard-working citizens who make this country run.""

So, what's next on the budget chairman's agenda? Just one thing — or three, as he said to Fox News Digital, ""spending cuts, spending cuts and spending cuts.""

""We didn't get into this mess overnight, we won't get out of it overnight, but we'll never get out if we don't start exercising the political will to do what we all say in our campaigns,"" Arrington told Fox News Digital. ""I think we established a great model for restoring fiscal health, and we just have to continue to repeat it and do it in even more dramatic fashion in the future.""

Waltz publicly questioned for the first time about the 'Signal-gate' incident —where he accidentally added a journalist to a private Signal military chat.

Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is poised to face members of the Senate Tuesday to get the ball rolling on his nomination to represent the U.S. at the United Nations.

Waltz's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee comes months after he exited his job at the White House amid controversy surrounding his role in a Signal group chat with other top administration officials. 

Waltz is expected to call for reforms at the U.N. and is expected to say that it's time to redirect the organization's focus back to peacekeeping, according to his opening statement shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. Waltz's statement says that the U.S. has footed the bill for missions that have endured for decades, and amount to nation-building rather than peacekeeping. 

Likewise, Waltz is expected to promise to turn up the heat on countering China and vow to work with the State Department to mitigate Chinese influence. 

""Countering China is critical,"" a draft of Waltz's statement says. ""It's absurd that the world's second-largest economy is treated as a developing nation throughout UN agencies that gives China favorable status.""

Waltz's prepared remarks also urge weeding out ""pervasive"" antisemitism in the U.N., and claims that the U.N. passed ""154 resolutions against Israel versus 71 against all other nations combined.""

Additionally, Waltz's statement calls for slimming down the U.N. with staff cuts, due to an overlap in missions and ""wasteful"" resources throughout the U.N.'s more than 80 agencies. 

""It's worth remembering that, even with cuts, the US is by far the most generous nation in the world,"" Waltz's draft statement says. 

Democrats vowed to grill Waltz during his confirmation process in the aftermath of the Atlantic magazine's reporting about a Signal group chat that his team had set up to discuss strikes against the Houthis in March.

Even so, the tough questioning from Democrats on the so-called ""Signalgate"" issue isn't expected to derail Waltz's confirmation to the post, given that Republicans hold a 53–47 majority in the Senate. 

""It's all theater — you know he's going to get confirmed,"" a GOP foreign relations source told Fox News Digital. ""If Signalgate's a big thing against him, it wasn't enough to get anyone else fired or impeached or anything like that."" 

SENATE DEMOCRATS PREDICTING ‘BRUTAL' UN AMBASSADOR CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR MIKE WALTZ

Waltz, a former congressman who represented Florida's 6th congressional district, is a retired Army National Guard colonel and former Green Beret. During his time in uniform, he served four deployments to Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars — the fourth-highest military combat award, issued for heroic service against an armed enemy.

Waltz and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth were both entangled in the Signal chat that Waltz's team created where members of the Trump administration discussed strike plans against the Houthis. 

Waltz in March said he took ""full responsibility"" for the Signal group chat, and the Trump administration has maintained that no war plans were shared in the chat. The Atlantic published the full exchange of messages, which included certain attack details such as specific aircraft and times of the strikes from Hegseth. 

On May 1, President Donald Trump announced Waltz's departure from his role as national security advisor and hours later unveiled the former Florida congressman's nomination to represent the U.S. at the U.N. 

Democrats called for Hegseth's resignation as a result of the chat and warned that Waltz would face the heat during the confirmation process for U.N. ambassador. 

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in a May interview with CBS News that Waltz could count on a ""brutal, brutal hearing"" from senators, and described his nomination as ""failing up."" 

""He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in this Signal chain,"" Duckworth, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CBS News. 

Duckworth, who served in the Illinois Army National Guard as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot and lost both of her legs during a 2004 deployment to Iraq, told Fox News Digital Monday that Waltz's involvement in the group chat should disqualify him from serving as U.N. ambassador. She also said that every official included in the chat should be fired. 

""As a retired Soldier, Waltz should have shut the unclassified chain down as soon as he saw Hegseth share such classified information that could've gotten our pilots killed,"" Duckworth said in a statement. ""It's clear Waltz cannot be trusted to make critical and sensitive national security decisions, and I look forward to pressing him on his conduct and holding him accountable.""

NEXT US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR? HERE'S WHOM TRUMP MIGHT PICK TO REPLACE WALTZ 

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., said that Mike Waltz's involvement in the Signal group chat leak should disqualify him from serving as U.N. ambassador. 

Duckworth has pinned most of the blame on Hegseth for Signalgate. Prior to Trump's announcement on Waltz's U.N. ambassador nomination, Duckworth said in a May post on X that of ""all the idiots in that chat, Hegseth is the biggest security risk of all — he leaked the info that put our troops in greater danger."" 

In addition to Waltz and Hegseth, administration officials including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were part of the group chat. 

Additionally, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Chris Coons, D-Conn., said that Waltz could brace for a meticulous confirmation hearing before the committee's members. 

""I look forward to a thorough confirmation hearing,"" Coons said in a post on X in May. 

A spokesperson for Coons did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

The GOP foreign relations source described the fallout from Signalgate a ""huge nothing burger,"" and pointed out that Democrats' previous efforts to use Signalgate against Waltz and Hegseth have proven unsuccessful. 

""If this was their deathly bullet, it would have killed Hegseth, and it would have killed Waltz, but they're both left standing,"" the source told Fox News Digital. 

A Senate aide told Fox News Digital that while Waltz took the brunt of the blame for Signalgate because his team created the chat, Democrats' expected questioning of the group chat during the hearing is actually about finding a new avenue to go after Trump. 

""I don't think he's the target. He's just the mechanism to go after the target,"" the Senate aide said. ""At the end of the day, Democrats want to criticize and go after the president, so these guys are just a mechanism to get there."" 

Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have voiced support for Waltz, with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, calling him a ""great choice"" for the position in a post on X in May. Additionally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at the time that the Senate would ""for sure"" confirm Waltz. 

""Some things I know for sure: the sun rises in the East, sets in the West and Mike Waltz will be confirmed as the next UN Ambassador,"" Graham said in an X post in May. ""He is highly qualified, well-positioned, and will be a strong voice for our nation at the UN.""

Since Waltz's departure as serving as national security advisor, Rubio has stepped in to fill that role.

Trump previously nominated Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to represent the U.S. at the U.N. However, her nomination was pulled in March, and Trump claimed at the time that the House could not give up another Republican seat with its slim 220–212 Republican majority. 

If confirmed as U.N. ambassador, Waltz would be responsible for representing U.S. interests at the U.N.'s New York headquarters, weighing in on resolutions, treaties and other global matters.  

Waltz could not be reached for comment by Fox News Digital.

The 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly is scheduled for Sept. 9, providing a window of time for Waltz's nomination to make it through the entire confirmation process beforehand. 

""The hope is to have him in place before the U.N. General Assembly is in session,"" the GOP foreign relations source told Fox News Digital.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","White House squeezes Senate holdouts to pass DOGE cuts","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3471083/white-house-squeezes-senate-holdouts-doge-cuts/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Senators are hearing from the White House and President Donald Trump himself as the Senate prepares to vote on the first DOGE-inspired legislation of his second term.

Russ Vought, the White House budget chief, will visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to discuss his request to cancel $9.4 billion in spending, known as a rescissions bill. Separately, Trump has been engaging with senators on the request and last week threatened political consequences for any Republican who votes “no.”

Republicans are broadly supportive of the cuts, which target foreign aid and public broadcasting, but centrist members have been seeking amendments that would protect $900 million earmarked for global health programs.

A handful of members are also concerned about how the $1.1 billion in cuts to public broadcasting, aimed at outlets such as NPR and PBS, would affect radio access for tribal populations in their states.

With a Friday deadline to cancel the funds, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has been meeting with holdouts to discuss how the bill might be amended to win the 50 votes needed for passage, but the White House wants to avoid changes if possible and has been deploying Vought to ease their concerns.

Vought briefed Senate appropriators on the rescissions bill last month and has been in touch with undecided members in the lead-up to the first procedural vote, slated for Tuesday. 

That outreach has helped keep Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a wildcard Republican who announced his retirement last month, open to the bill. He said the Office of Management and Budget has been “very responsive” to him, but threatened to flip against the cuts without adequate consultation for his colleagues.

“I'm a lean yes – but, you know, as long as the people who are asking legitimate questions get answers to it,” Tillis said. “If they don't, then I may rethink it.”

Other skeptical Republicans include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY), both powerful appropriators who scrutinized Vought at their hearing in June, and senators like Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who represent states with large Native American populations.

Ahead of the first procedural vote, Vought has been invited to Senate Republicans' Tuesday lunch, giving him a final chance to answer the questions of members who weren't plugged into the process until early July, after Congress passed the tax-and-spending megabill through the reconciliation process.

“Quite frankly, a lot of this is just making sure people have accurate information about what's in, what's out, what's affected, what isn't, because we were so consumed with reconciliation for the better part of two months,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), who was tapped in June to usher the rescissions bill through the Senate.

“So it's just really, honestly, providing information that's the most important thing we're doing right now,” Schmitt added.

Thune told reporters Monday that he was unsure if the $9.4 billion request, spurred by the Department of Government Efficiency, would be altered but said Republicans have spent days talking through possible amendments.

The special process used to claw back spending is filibuster-proof, meaning Republicans can pass it along party lines, but it must first survive a series of procedural votes, followed by a so-called “vote-a-rama” that opens the legislation up to modification.

“We've got a lot of feedback, and I know there are folks who would like to see at least some modest changes to it, but it's always, again, what the traffic will bear,” Thune said. “You know, we want to get on it, and we're going to need 51 to get on and 51 to get off.”

Vought is projecting confidence that the bill will pass the Senate, though he conceded it would be “tight” in a brief interview with the Washington Examiner on Friday.

Thune can only afford to lose three Republicans on any party-line vote and, earlier this month, required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie on their sprawling megabill. The rescissions bill squeaked through the House in a 214-212 vote in June, losing just four Republicans.

Schmitt, who has stayed in touch with Trump on the rescissions bill, said the president is actively engaged in the Senate vote. On Thursday, Trump bristled at the dollars given to PBS and NPR, threatening in a Truth Social post to withhold his endorsement from any Republican who votes to preserve the funding.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), a Trump ally, said the president also vented about the broadcast funding cuts in a phone call last Thursday.

Trump has used the threat of primary meddling with mixed success in the past. Tillis, one of three Republicans to oppose the megabill, refused to flip his vote and instead announced his retirement in the face of a similar warning.

Instead, Senate leadership is weighing how it can cobble together the 50 votes by accommodating reluctant senators ahead of the vote-a-rama. In that process, Republicans and Democrats can offer an unlimited number of amendments before a vote on final passage, but leadership wants to square away any GOP changes ahead of time to avoid drama on the Senate floor.

HOW THUNE AND TRUMP GOT BEHIND ‘ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The House would then have to pass the Senate's version of the rescission before the deadline, a 45-day legislative stop clock that ends on Friday.

“We'll try to do as much as we can before the vote-a-rama happens,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), an adviser to Thune. “I know it doesn't seem like that long way, but 30 hours away, a lot of things can happen in 30 hours.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Most notable, however, was a line in the letter in which the Republican attorney general speculated that “cloud seeding” technology could have played a role in the Texas floods that have killed 132 people and left 101 missing.

“As our hearts break for the victims of the flash floods in Texas, I can't help but notice the possibility that weather modification could have played a role in this tragedy,” Uthmeier wrote. “Developing reports show that a weather modification company conducted ‘cloud seeding' operations just days before the deadly flood.”

“Florida's new law seeks to prevent anything like that from ever happening,” he added.

Uthmeier referred to concerns over a 20-minute cloud seeding mission by Rainmaker Technology Corporation on July 2 over Karnes County, southeast of the flood zone. Two clouds were targeted and dissipated later that day. RTC CEO Augustus Doricko produced documents showing no further missions were carried out on July 3-4, with the floods starting on July 4.

The mission triggered conspiracy theories that the mission played a role in triggering the flash floods, which shocked the public with its spontaneity and ferocity. Doricko posted a detailed thread on X, inviting any scrutiny but undercutting allegations that his company had any role in the floods.

“Natural clouds typically have lifespans of 30 minutes to a few hours at most, with even the most persistent storm systems rarely maintaining the same cloud structure for more than 12-18 hours. The clouds that were seeded on July 2nd dissipated over 24 hours prior to the developing storm complex that would produce the flooding rainfall,” he wrote.

Doricko also released a detailed meteorological report around the mission.

Meteorologists and other experts cast heavy doubt on claims that the mission could have had any role in the Texas floods. 

Veteran Houston meteorologist Travis Herzog with ABC 13 argued against the theory, arguing that there was no scientific evidence for it. He pointed out that floods of the July 4 type are rare but had ample precedent long before cloud seeding technology was created. The unique terrain of the affected area, combined with remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Barry and Hurricane Flossie, produced a deadly combo.

“Due to the hilly terrain, when high amounts of rain fall in a short period of time, the water flows quickly through the creek and river valleys, sometimes with devastating and deadly consequences like we are witnessing on this July 4th holiday weekend. (See also the Blanco River flood in Wimberley on Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Canyon Lake flood in July 2002, or the Guadalupe River flood in July 1987 for some of the more recent examples.),” He wrote in a post on Facebook.

He argued that cloud seeding technology can't produce the significant rainfall needed to trigger the flash floods.

“Cloud seeding cannot create a storm of this magnitude or size. In fact, cloud seeding cannot even create a single cloud,” Herzog wrote. “All it can do is take an existing cloud and enhance the rainfall by up to 20%, and even that is on the high end.”

He added that “it is physically impossible for that to have created this weather system. This is a matter of scale. If I blow out a candle with my breath, does that mean I can then go blow out a raging wildfire? It is the same with cloud-seeding.”

Herzog also countered conspiracy theories from the other side, which claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency cuts to the National Weather Service hindered its forecast and warning operations. He wrote that his analysis found that the weather service had issued timely warnings as the events unfolded and that he saw no evidence that any cuts “hurt the situation.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump's January 2025 Executive Order 14190, Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling, directed a sweeping rollback of “woke ideology” in federal educational settings. The order included Department of Defense Education Activity schools. And it was explicit: Federal entities were to remove or cease publication of materials that promote gender ideology, radical social justice narratives, or racially divisive content.

Despite the federal mandate, however, parents stationed at U.S. military bases around the globe are still finding books that contradict the spirit and letter of the executive order. This is especially true in library areas for the youngest readers outside of on-base schools. Libraries at Air Force, Army, and Navy installations continue to offer children's books that push messages many parents find inappropriate and, in some cases, disturbing.

What's showing up on military library bookshelves are full-fledged activist books that introduce children to transgenderism, radical political slogans, drag queens, and even narratives that demonize whiteness and American history.

At Aviano Air Base in Italy, home to two Air Force F-16 fighter squadrons, one mother was shocked to find copies of A is for Activist on display in the children's section. The alphabet book, marketed for toddlers and preschoolers, includes pages like:

“T is for Trans. For Trains, Tiaras, Tulips, Tractors, And Tigers too! Trust in The True, he she They That is you!”

Another page shows a raised fist holding a broom beneath the text: “J is for Justice! Yay for Justice! Jia-Jing Jiang. Juanita. Jamal. Justice for the Janitors, Justicia for all!”

These are slogans drawn directly from progressive political movements. The book is intentionally designed to groom toddlers into activist worldviews. It's not teaching children to be kind or fair. It's teaching them to protest. The mother, a veteran of multiple duty stations and a former DoDEA employee, shared her reaction with me:

“When I confronted them in person, they said DoDEA (the base school) makes the selection of their books. I am shocked and appalled that these books are not only available on the taxpayers' dime but also prominently displayed in the kids' section. I hate that even after an executive order from our president, employees think they don't have to follow the law. This shows how broken our system is and how much they want our children groomed.”

When she submitted a complaint, the library staff's response was telling. In a formal email, the supervisory librarian at the Aviano Base Library clarified that while the base follows executive orders regarding new DEI and gender-ideology publications, it does not apply the same standards retroactively to commercially published materials already in circulation. In other words, existing books, no matter their content, stay on the shelves.

The librarian noted that selection is partly governed by the American Library Association's Bill of Rights, and emphasized that “the selection process is free from censorship.” But to many parents, this isn't about censorship. It's about age-appropriateness, parental rights, and respecting federal law.

A second mother, currently stationed at Fort Rucker, Alabama, also raised concerns after taking her two young children, ages 5 and 3, to her base's library.

“The library is a space that I can give them freedom to be independent in the pre-K through elementary school room. They can pick out their own books, and it's been so fun.”

But recently, her daughter pulled a book off the shelf because she saw a princess on the cover. The book, The Maiden and the Princess, is a romantic story between two women. The mother then found Prince & Knight, which culminates in a same-sex kiss, and Cinderella and a Mouse Called Fred, in which a transgender mouse falls in love with Cinderella. Perhaps most shocking: Swish, Swish!, Go the Drag Queen's Hips, a book about drag queens performing in extravagant costumes, hips swaying.

The mother especially lamented that her children were encountering these books without any warning, guidance, or parental oversight.

Similarly, at the Navy base in Bahrain, headquarters for the Navy's 5th Fleet, photos from the children's reading area show large displays dedicated to “DEI Heritage,” highlighting themes of race, gender, and social activism. 

These were found and documented by Amy Haywood, founder of the nonprofit group Military Families in Support of Parental Rights, which has been tracking the continued presence of progressive ideology in military education settings. She told me, “It is beyond alarming that a book about men with a sexual fetish for cosplaying as garish women is being made available to small children in a U.S. military base library. Who is curating the collection? What books were weeded in order to make room for this and other books that further the lie that children can be born in the wrong body?”

This isn't just a battle over books; it's a deeper look at a federal system openly ignoring a presidential order. Too many librarians, administrators, and educational bureaucrats continue to act as if they know better and have more authority than the chain of command.

Even when parents raise concerns, the response is bureaucratic deflection. Officials claim no affiliation with DoDEA, deny responsibility for selections, or simply say the books “don't violate policy.” It's a hall of mirrors that frustrates concerned parents.

In turn, military parents are now in charge of reclaiming parental authority over what their children are exposed to.

One such effort is the Families' Rights and Responsibilities Act, which was recently delivered to all 535 offices in the House and Senate. The letter attached to the bill highlights the failure of existing military family organizations to protect parents from ideological overreach. The first two priorities? Matters facing military families, especially in education and library content, remain unaddressed by legacy advocacy groups.

A SENSIBLE LOOK AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CUTS

The problem is not merely that inappropriate or ideological books exist. The problem is that they exist in places where military families assume materials are age-appropriate and politically neutral. Places where a presidential executive order should mean something.

Instead, military parents are finding out that the culture war isn't confined to elite universities or progressive school districts. And if you don't look closely, your 5-year-old may be learning about gender fluidity or drag queens without your consent, and with your tax dollars.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Federal workers warned for months that the high-energy biscuits would go to waste.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Five months into its unprecedented dismantling of foreign-aid programs, the Trump administration has given the order to incinerate food instead of sending it to people abroad who need it. Nearly 500 metric tons of emergency food—enough to feed about 1.5 million children for a week—are set to expire tomorrow, according to current and former government employees with direct knowledge of the rations. Within weeks, two of those sources told me, the food, meant for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, will be ash. (The sources I spoke with for this story requested anonymity for fear of professional repercussions.)

Sometime near the end of the Biden administration, USAID spent about $800,000 on the high-energy biscuits, one current and one former employee at the agency told me. The biscuits, which cram in the nutritional needs of a child under 5, are a stopgap measure, often used in scenarios where people have lost their homes in a natural disaster or fled a war faster than aid groups could set up a kitchen to receive them. They were stored in a Dubai warehouse and intended to go to the children this year.

Since January, when the Trump administration issued an executive order that halted virtually all American foreign assistance, federal workers have sent the new political leaders of USAID repeated requests to ship the biscuits while they were useful, according to the two USAID employees. USAID bought the biscuits intending to have the World Food Programme distribute them, and under previous circumstances, career staff could have handed off the biscuits to the United Nations agency on their own. But since Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency disbanded USAID and the State Department subsumed the agency, no money or aid items can move without the approval of the new heads of American foreign assistance, several current and former USAID employees told me. From January to mid-April, the responsibility rested with Pete Marocco, who worked across multiple agencies during the first Trump administration; then it passed to Jeremy Lewin, a law-school graduate in his 20s who was originally installed by DOGE and now has appointments at both USAID and State. Two of the USAID employees told me that staffers who sent the memos requesting approval to move the food never got a response and did not know whether Marocco or Lewin ever received them. (The State Department did not answer my questions about why the food was never distributed.)

In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told representatives on the House Appropriations Committee that he would ensure that food aid would reach its intended recipients before spoiling. But by then, the order to incinerate the biscuits (which I later reviewed) had already been sent. Rubio has insisted that the administration embraces America's responsibility to continue saving foreign lives, including through food aid. But in April, according to NPR, the U.S. government eliminated all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Yemen, where, the State Department said at the time, providing food risks benefiting terrorists. (The State Department has offered no similar justification for pulling aid to Pakistan.) Even if the administration was unwilling to send the biscuits to the originally intended countries, other places—Sudan, say, where war is fueling the world's worst famine in decades—could have benefited. Instead, the biscuits in the Dubai warehouse continue to approach their expiration date, after which their vitamin and fat content will begin to deteriorate rapidly. At this point, United Arab Emirates policy prevents the biscuits from even being repurposed as animal feed.

Over the coming weeks, the food will be destroyed at a cost of $130,000 to American taxpayers (on top of the $800,000 used to purchase the biscuits), according to current and former federal aid workers I spoke with. One current USAID staffer told me he'd never seen anywhere near this many biscuits trashed over his decades working in American foreign aid. Sometimes food isn't stored properly in warehouses, or a flood or a terrorist group complicates deliveries; that might result in, at most, a few dozen tons of fortified foods being lost in a given year. But several of the aid workers I spoke with reiterated that they have never before seen the U.S. government simply give up on food that could have been put to good use.

The emergency biscuits slated for destruction represent only a small fraction of America's typical annual investment in food aid. In fiscal year 2023, USAID purchased more than 1 million metric tons of food from U.S. producers. But the collapse of American foreign aid raises the stakes of every loss. Typically, the biscuits are the first thing that World Food Programme workers hand to Afghan families who are being forced out of Pakistan and back to their home country, which has been plagued by severe child malnutrition for years. Now the WFP can support only one of every 10 Afghans who are in urgent need of food assistance. The WFP projects that, globally, 58 million people are at risk for extreme hunger or starvation because this year, it lacks the money to feed them. Based on calculations from one of the current USAID employees I spoke with, the food marked for destruction could have met the nutritional needs of every child facing acute food insecurity in Gaza for a week.

Despite the administration's repeated promises to continue food aid, and Rubio's testimony that he would not allow existing food to go to waste, even more food could soon expire. Hundreds of thousands of boxes of emergency food pastes, also already purchased, are currently collecting dust in American warehouses. According to USAID inventory lists from January, more than 60,000 metric tons of food—much of it grown in America, and all already purchased by the U.S. government—were then sitting in warehouses across the world. That included 36,000 pounds of peas, oil, and cereal, which were stored in Djibouti and intended for distribution in Sudan and other countries in the Horn of Africa. A former senior official at USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance told me that, by the time she'd left her job earlier this month, very little of the food seemed to have moved; one of the current USAID employees I spoke with confirmed her impression, though he noted that, in recent weeks, small shipments have begun leaving the Djibouti warehouse.

Read: ‘In three months, half of them will be dead'

Such operations are more difficult for USAID to manage today than they were last year because many of the humanitarian workers and supply-chain experts who once coordinated the movement of American-grown food to hungry people around the world no longer have their jobs. Last month, the CEOs of the two American companies that make another kind of emergency food for malnourished children both told The New York Times that the government seemed unsure of how to ship the food it had already purchased. Nor, they told me, have they received any new orders. (A State Department spokesperson told me that the department had recently approved additional purchases, but both CEOs told me they have yet to receive the orders. The State Department has not responded to further questions about these purchases.) But even if the Trump administration decides tomorrow to buy more food aid—or simply distribute what the government already owns while the food is still useful—it may no longer have the capacity to make sure anyone receives it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The American people deserve to know the Court's reasoning.

The Supreme Court is allowing Donald Trump to dismantle the Department of Education. But it won't say why.

Yesterday—almost exactly a week after the Court lifted a lower court's block on Trump's plans to fire thousands of federal employees—a majority of the justices decided to give the president the go-ahead for a different set of mass layoffs. Last week, the Court provided a handful of sentences that vaguely gestured at why it might have allowed the administration to move forward. This week, it offered nothing at all. There's something taunting, almost bullying, about this lack of reasoning, as if the conservative supermajority is saying to the country: You don't even deserve an explanation.

Whereas last week's case involved orders to lay off employees from across the entire federal government, this week's involves just the Education Department. Over the course of his 2024 campaign and in the first few months of his second term, Trump repeatedly announced his plans to close the agency. The department was “a big con job,” he told reporters in February, and he would “like to close it immediately.” In March, Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced plans to cut the department's workforce in half. Trump followed up with an executive order mandating that McMahon “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.”

There was one minor problem with this plan: The executive branch, at least theoretically, did not have the unilateral authority to abolish the Education Department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979. A coalition of states, school districts, and unions sued, and a federal district court temporarily blocked the administration from moving forward. That court order required the department to rehire employees already laid off, pointing to both the Constitution and a statutory prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” actions by federal agencies.

David A. Graham: What does the Department of Education actually do?

In that lower court, the government argued that it sought only to improve the “efficiency” and “accountability” of the department through “reorganization,” but District Judge Myong J. Joun was unconvinced. “A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” he wrote. An appeals court upheld Joun's ruling, freezing Trump's plans while the district court continued to weigh the underlying legal questions.

At this point—stop me if you've heard this one before—the Supreme Court stepped in. Despite a frustrated dissent from the Court's three liberal justices, the majority's unsigned emergency ruling allowed Trump to carry out his plans while the litigation in the lower courts continues. “The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “but either way the threat to our Constitution's separation of powers is grave.” She went on: “The President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them.”

The odd protocol of the Court's emergency docket—sometimes called the “shadow docket”—means that the underlying question of whether Trump has the legal authority to tear apart the Education Department remains unresolved, even as a majority of the justices have allowed him to carry out his plans. Courts—even the Supreme Court—could still find the department's dismantling illegal down the road. But in the meantime, the agency will have been devastated, perhaps irreparably. Layoffs will dramatically reduce the staffing of the already overworked Office of Civil Rights, which is responsible for ensuring equal access to education, including for disabled students. The administration will eviscerate the office responsible for helping students with financial aid for higher education; the government has said that this portion of the agency's portfolio will be shifted over to the Treasury Department, but what this will look like in practice is unclear. The cuts will almost erase the Institute for Education Science, which publishes authoritative data on American schools and has already missed key deadlines this year.

Given the potentially devastating effects of the Supreme Court's ruling on congressionally mandated programs, it's all the more galling that the majority didn't bother to provide even a cursory explanation of its thinking. This terseness has become common as the Court has scaled up its use of emergency rulings—rulings that, it's hard not to notice, have a striking tendency to align with the Trump administration's priorities. Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and an authority on the shadow docket, tallied the Education Department order as the 15th since early April in which the Court has granted Trump emergency relief, and the seventh in which the justices have provided not a word of explanation. (Until recently, the shadow docket was used far more rarely, and only for truly urgent matters.) Do the conservative justices feel that the president really does have the legal authority to destroy a Cabinet department on his own? Or perhaps they believe that the plaintiffs lacked the ability to bring the case at all in federal court? Maybe the reason was something else altogether. There's no way to know.

This silence is damaging, both to the legitimacy of the Court and to the rule of law. The judiciary is a branch of government that is meant to provide reasons for its actions—to explain, both to litigants and to the public, why judges have done what they have done. This is part of what distinguishes law from the raw exercise of power, and what anchors the courts as a component of a democratic system rather than setting them apart as unaccountable sages. With a written opinion, people can evaluate the justices' reasoning for themselves. Without it, they are left to puzzle over the Court's thinking like ancients struggling to decipher the wrath of gods in the scattering of entrails.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What We Gain by Forgetting","https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2025/07/girl-1983-linn-ullmann-novel-review/683521/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

In Linn Ullmann's memoiristic fiction, the erosion of memories is a feature, not a bug.

When it comes to memoirs, an author's task is clear: Remember how it happened; then, tell the truth. Writers who draw on personal stories are often dogged by nonfiction's prevailing imperative of factual precision. They should want, above all, to get it right.

But what if one has forgotten it, even if that thing feels important enough to write about? Whatever the reason for a memory's erasure—the blitheness of youth, the defense mechanism of blocking out pain, the natural erosion of particulars over time—it often throbs like a phantom limb, no less potent for the absence of details. Faces and words may fade, but their emotional residue frequently lingers.

A diligent storyteller might curse these gaps as hopeless obstructions, but the Norwegian author Linn Ullmann has reconceived them as central to her work. “How do experiences live on, not as memories, but as absences?” asks the narrator of Girl, 1983, Ullmann's latest novel, now translated into English by Martin Aitken. The book seeks to answer this query by recasting personal writing as a conversation between recollection and amnesia. For the protagonist of Girl, 1983, this relationship is intensified by competing desires: to recover the lost shards of a painful adolescent memory, or to let them fade into oblivion.

Ullmann's protagonist seeks to record a past experience that she struggles to fully remember, but the autobiographical elements she does provide tend to align with Ullmann's own history. These varied tensions between fiction and fact ripple throughout the book in vivid recollections drawn from Ullmann's life, broad smears of vanished history, and interludes depicting the uneasy work of remembering. A reader might get the sense that Ullmann has removed the top of her head in order to reveal the choreography of her mind. And yet, Ullmann calls this introspective book a novel, imposing some distance between herself and the story she's told. She challenges the idea that memoir is more intimate than fiction, and manipulates genre to express a vulnerable relationship to her own cerebral archive: what she can claim to know, what she can't bear to face, what she has lost.

Read: Knausgaard gave you all the clues

It is fitting, for these reasons, that Girl, 1983—the title of which reads like an aptly cryptic caption—begins with a missing object. Ullmann opens the book by describing a lost photograph, one taken of the unnamed narrator when she was 16, “which no longer exists and which no one apart from me remembers.” Forty years later, when the narrator has a 16-year-old daughter of her own, and finds herself unmoored by depression during a COVID-19 lockdown, she decides to write about the picture and the circumstances surrounding it. Her choice is fraught because, by the narrator's own admission, “the story about the photograph makes me sick, it's a shitty story.” She has “abandoned it a thousand and one different times for a thousand and one different reasons.”

The narrator thinks back to October 1982, when, while riding the elevator in her mother's New York City apartment, she catches the eye of a 44-year-old photographer, “K,” who invites her to come to Paris for a modeling gig. She readily accepts, despite her mother's protests. Soon after she arrives, she begins a sexual relationship with K. She is thrilled to model for this older man, and ultimately poses for him once, before telling him she wants to go home. He derides her as a “crybaby” and a “neurotic little bitch” whom he regrets meeting.

Here the paragraph breaks, and once more, the protagonist claims forgetfulness. “I don't remember one day from another,” she narrates. “I don't remember how many days I was there, in Paris, in January 1983, perhaps five or seven.” Her complicated desire for K—erotic in nature, and yet based in a childlike longing for approval—produces an irrecuperable psychic fissure. She is repelled by his aging, “decrepit” body and embarrassed by her own “greedy body saying yes” to his sexual maneuvers. Nonetheless, their affair continues in New York City, though it is short-lived and ends abruptly; the photograph he takes of her runs in a 1983 issue of a now-defunct French fashion magazine. For safekeeping, the narrator slips a copy of the picture inside a white notebook, but when she searches for it decades later, both the photo and the notebook are gone. To tell the photograph's story, she must summon the details from memory as best she can.

Those familiar with Ullmann's biography might immediately suspect that she is the girl in the photo; after all, her own upbringing echoes the one depicted here. Ullmann is the daughter of the late Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and the Norwegian actor Liv Ullmann, and specifics of her childhood are not difficult to locate. Moreover, it is her own teenaged face that peers from behind the typescript on the book's cover, looming above the words “A Novel.” You might find this interplay between word and image destabilizing. Perhaps Ullmann sought in fiction the creative and emotional freedom to portray both her atypical childhood and her parents in more impressionistic terms, or perhaps she hoped that classifying the book as a novel would offer some measure of privacy to her family and herself.

Then again, Ullmann is in well-traveled territory. Autobiographical novels and works that otherwise test the boundaries between novel and memoir—Karl Ove Knausgaard's My Struggle, Ocean Vuong's On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, Sheila Heti's How Should a Person Be?—are familiar to contemporary readers. Literature has a distinct ability to illuminate truth's multiplicities; writers like Ullmann remind readers that fact and fiction are fragile categories, and that collapsing them can yield enthralling results. Girl, 1983 is still more deft in its experiments, subverting conventional ideas about fiction's use of the truth. A reader might expect autobiographical fiction to flesh out the skeleton of a memory with invented details. Ullmann instead draws on the category of the novel to embrace the gaps, to insist on their primacy in any remembered history. Ullmann has not just written an autobiographical novel; she has suggested that every autobiography might be a novel in the first place.

Read: In defense of fakeness

If Ullmann had labeled Girl, 1983 a memoir, few readers would have raised an eyebrow, because she barely disguises her story's basis in autobiography. The protagonist is undoubtedly her proxy: Like Ullmann, she is a writer in her 50s, half Norwegian and half Swedish, with an actress mother who was “one of the most beautiful women in the world” and an illustrious father who was largely absent from her upbringing. And like Ullmann, the protagonist has already written a novel that was “based on real events.” Unquiet, translated into English by Thilo Reinhard in 2019, chronicles Ullmann's parental relationships—particularly with Bergman—with seeming fidelity.

For Ullmann, designating her latest work a novel seems to communicate something both distinctly personal and universally true. By foregrounding incomplete memories—she writes about trying to ascertain “the order of events, the ones I remembered and the ones I'd forgotten and which I had to imagine”—Ullmann lays bare the reality that minds are not so much storage devices as sieves. As her protagonist puts it, “Forgetfulness is greater than memory.” To call Girl, 1983 a novel, rather than a memoir, is no mere exercise in literary classification, nor is it only a challenge to the limits of genre. It is surrender, inscribed: an acknowledgement that ownership of one's memories is provisional, an unstable cache susceptible to time and circumstance.

Ullmann's protagonist wrestles with this difficulty. Over the course of the novel, she struggles to recount the Parisian photo shoot and her affair with K. The history is “made up mostly of forgetting, just as the body is composed mostly of water,” she explains. The story, separated into three sections—Blue, Red, and White—travels a spiraled, associative, and fragmented path, making persistent returns to the events connected to the photograph. Most notably, it frequently revisits the protagonist's past and present relationship with her often-distracted mother. Indeed, the narrator's desire for proximity to her mother forms the connective tissue stitching together the chronology of her childhood. “I've never been much good at distinguishing between what happened and what may have happened,” she reflects. “The contours are blurred, and Mamma's face is a big white cloud over it all.” Perhaps recollection always requires a degree of fiction-making, not simply because people are inherently forgetful but because memories are shaped as much by impression and sensibility—a mother's face, the hazy sketch of a dark Parisian street—as they are by actual events.

And yet, as Ullmann makes clear, remembering and forgetting are not so much actions as forces that everyone must negotiate. One might try to foster conditions for remembrance—take photographs, keep a journal, stash relics—but forgetfulness sets its own obscure terms. This need not be distressing. In fact, there is something pleasurable in setting down the burdens of the past. “I don't want to lose the ability to lose things,” the narrator protests, in response to a promotional email for an app that makes it easier to retrieve misplaced items. Too much past accumulates; it gnaws like a parasite, thriving on the vitality of one's most punishing memories. What a relief, to let some things fade away.

No one should have to choose between their community and their own integrity.

A decade after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Southern Baptist Convention wants to roll it back. In June, the SBC overwhelmingly voted to pass a resolution, “On Restoring Moral Clarity Through God's Design for Gender, Marriage, and the Family,” which defines marriage as an exclusively heterosexual covenant and calls for the overturning of Obergefell.

For many Americans, gay marriage feels like a settled issue. For Southern Baptists and others who share their theology, the question of the legality of gay marriage is still open. In their view, political and theological opposition is the only possible Christian response to gay marriage, and continuing to challenge marriage equality is a moral duty. The Church they have shaped has no room for the alternative path that many gay Christians have found: not leaving our religion, but embracing our sexuality alongside our faith.

I grew up in conservative, evangelical churches. For my undergraduate degree, I attended Union University, a Southern Baptist school in Jackson, Tennessee. I graduated in 2013, and in the years leading up to Obergefell I saw how the growing cultural acceptance of same-sex relationships was haunting Southern Baptist leaders, who viewed it as an existential threat. Their idea of Christian faithfulness in America became synonymous with fighting for a narrow, biblically literalist sexual ethic to be the law of the land.

The resolution from the Southern Baptist Convention echoes the arguments I heard as a student: Secular laws are meant to reflect God's moral order, and calling a same-sex partnership a marriage is flatly lying. In one of my ethics classes at Union, the professor insisted that Christians should strongly oppose the legalization of gay marriage as a matter of love for our neighbor. We should not let others enter into something we knew would be destructive, no matter how much they might think they wanted it.

One of my classmates suggested that people might be born gay. Would this require a more compassionate response? The professor was unfazed. “I'm sure there is a biological component, and that doesn't change my view. You can have cancer that is not your fault, and some people are born with cancer of the soul.”

David A. Graham: New, ominous signs for gay rights keep emerging

The threat Southern Baptists perceived was not just to the social order at large. I heard dire warnings that the legalization of gay marriage would become the catalyst for renewed Christian persecution in America. I heard sermons describing a future where our Church would be dismantled because we refused to perform same-sex marriages. Gay marriage was not a matter of individual freedom; the real freedom at stake was our religious liberty.

These predictions have not come to fruition in the 10 years since Obergefell, but the fears persist. In “On Restoring Moral Clarity,” it crops up in references to laws compelling people to “speak falsehoods about sex and gender” and the right of each person to “speak the truth without fear or coercion.” Though churches still have the freedom to refuse to perform gay marriages, ordain openly gay people, or serve Communion to those in same-sex relationships, the idea that Christians are legally forced to accept LGBTQ identities remains a powerful rhetorical tool.

My alma mater also benefits from religious exemptions to nondiscrimination laws: In 2020, Union University rescinded its admission of a student entering its nursing program after learning that he was gay. As it did then, the current student handbook at Union prohibits “homosexual activities” and the “promotion, advocacy, defense, or ongoing practice of a homosexual lifestyle.” Despite national reporting and a flood of stories from gay alumni about the damage these policies caused, the university continues to exclude LGBTQ students.

When I was a student at Union, I did not know I was a lesbian. Maybe it is more accurate to say that I could not know. I believed in and yearned for the God the Church had taught me about. I could not reconcile what I had been raised to believe God wanted from me with the truth of my sexuality.

When I finally realized I was gay, I was no longer in the Southern Baptist Church. After graduating from Union, I joined a congregation in the Anglican Church of North America, a conservative denomination formed in a split from the Episcopal Church over women's ordination and the inclusion of gay members. My new church's leaders felt no need to lament Obergefell when it passed, but they still taught that same-sex relationships were antithetical to Christianity. When I came out to them in 2018, the choice set before me was either lifelong celibacy or leaving my beloved community behind. According to my Southern Baptist education, I was also choosing whether to leave God behind.

The evangelical voices in my life framed my dilemma as a choice between faithfulness to God and weakness—a capitulation to secular logic and a selfish desire for pleasure. In Matthew 16:24, Jesus calls on his disciples to “deny themselves and take up their cross.” Gay Christians are all too familiar with these words as weapons. Everyone has a cross, we are told, and it just so happens that ours is living without the romantic partnership we are built to flourish within.

Pastors and mentors assured me that I was following God's design, so my sacrifice would eventually lead me to “have life … abundantly,” which Jesus promises in John 10:10, no matter how painful the interim. The final sentence of “On Restoring Moral Clarity” says that Christians proceed “trusting that” God's “ways lead to human flourishing.” No amount of despair, suffering, and death (most literally reflected in increased suicidality among LGBTQ people of faith) experienced by gay Christians has managed to challenge this presupposition. It is a matter of faith that our suffering is godly. We continue to receive counsel to take up our cross in the hope of a distant resurrection.

I spent years telling myself that I could love my Church enough to make up for all the love I would never have. I hoped that the emptiness that burned in my chest could be transformed. It was only one rule. Could I really not follow just one rule?

But that one rule was not one simple sacrifice. It was the total subjugation of my ability to give and receive love, an all-encompassing demand of fealty to the authority of my Church.

The ground shifted under me as I fought to stay in the Church. By the summer of 2020, I was in a deep crisis of faith. I saw gay Christians happily married while retaining their commitment to faith, and I could not in good conscience deny the Holy Spirit I saw at work in these relationships. I realized that the choice was not between God and my desire for a relationship. It was between my church community and my own integrity.

My decision to leave was agonizing. I sobbed through conversations where a pastor recited our Church's theology of marriage. I prayed for a way forward. In the end, the only way forward was out.

Today I work for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), at a congregation that fully affirms all LGBTQ people. I am effectively estranged from the communities that I grew up in and committed to as an adult. At first, I worried that embracing my sexuality alongside my faith meant choosing a less serious, less disciplined form of Christianity. Instead, I have found that in leaving my Church, I found only deeper love for God.

The cross I took up did not turn out to be forgoing romantic partnership for the rest of my life. Instead, it was listening to the voice of the Spirit within me even when it cost me more than I knew I had. I was not surprised to lose friendships and the network of support that I had had in the evangelical Church. What took longer to accept was the unmooring of my identity, the need to find a new center for my spirituality once I let go of the theology that shaped me. To affirm the goodness of my sexuality, I had to find a new home.

Stephanie Burt: A strange time to be trans

In my Southern Baptist university and the evangelical Churches I grew up attending, I often heard that opposition to gay marriage was a sincerely held religious belief that Christians should be allowed to practice. I never heard this same language extended to Christians who affirmed the goodness of same-sex relationships. I heard only that theological affirmation of LGBTQ identities was a weak attempt to appease secular culture.

For many Christians, affirmation of queer identities is an equally sincere religious conviction. The churches that embrace LGBTQ people as beloved members of the community are motivated by Christian love for God and neighbor. We see the beauty of God's design in our real, embodied lives, and we seek human flourishing that is more than an abstract promise of finding meaning in the pain.

The gay and trans Christians I know are the most committed people of faith I have ever met. We had every reason to leave, and yet we are still here. We are here because we still believe in Jesus, and we still believe the Spirit works through this beloved, holy, and achingly human Church.

Historically, the Church has seen marriage as a vocation, a calling from God to be formed by a particular way of life. When gay Christians seek to commit their life to their partner through marriage in the eyes of God and the law, they are asking for the religious liberty to act on their sincerely held convictions. For 10 years, Obergefell has protected our right to practice our faith as our conscience dictates. May we continue to have the freedom to love as God leads us to for many generations.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Good disaster management is premised on preparation.

In the days since the Texas flash-flood disaster, the Department of Homeland Security has had a stock response to questions about delays in the federal government's response, or about a recent rule requiring DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to personally approve FEMA expenditures over $100,000, including rescue teams. The response goes, over and over, like this: “FEMA is shifting from bloated, DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens … The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.”



The Trump administration has been using this line for more than a month now, in response to criticism of its plans to remake, or perhaps disband, FEMA. And many people who study emergency response agree that, to some degree, the agency needs reform. Yet now the administration's press to quickly strip down the agency is being tested against a devastating disaster for the first time. And it is violating a basic precept of emergency management: Be prepared.



In any disaster, responding quickly can help save people and salve the harm. Protocols should be well known and well practiced before an event. An active disaster that killed more than 130 people, with more than 160 still missing, is not the occasion to switch up the norms. “This is exactly what many of us are concerned about,” Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Urban Institute, told me. However much FEMA might benefit from change, remaking it in an ad hoc fashion will just result in more devastation, he said: “In the context of a really complicated emergency where lots of people's lives are at stake—that's just not where you want to see experimentation happening.”

Read: The problem with ‘move to higher ground'

And FEMA's response to the Texas flash-flood disaster has not been business as usual. Noem didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of urban-search-and-rescue teams—deployed in the past within hours during similar events—until more than 72 hours after the flooding had begun, per CNN reporting. The agency failed to answer thousands of calls from flood survivors after allowing contracts for call-center workers to lapse one day after the disaster, according to The New York Times. FEMA had fewer than 100 people on the ground in Texas within four days of the disaster, and 311 by day five; within a week of Hurricane Helene, during what Donald Trump deemed a failed response to the flooding, FEMA deployed 1,500.



The situation on the ground in these immediate post-event moments can create a fog-of-war atmosphere, and no complete assessment of the federal government's reaction will be possible until later. “Like with any really catastrophic event, it's hard to understand what's happening at a micro level,” Rumbach said. Several non-FEMA rescue teams from other states and Mexico traveled to Texas to help, supplementing Texas's own robust emergency-response apparatus. But each of the other state teams waited on FEMA to call them up, as is protocol; FEMA didn't begin to activate any of them until last Monday, according to CNN. No missing person has been found alive since last Friday. “It's clear that the initial response was much smaller and more measured than you would expect from FEMA,” Rumbach said. “It's different from what you would expect a year ago, in terms of the number of personnel and the speed of response.” And FEMA is simply operating with fewer resources: About a quarter of the agency's staff has left since Trump took office in January, according to the Times. Due to vacancies, there is currently no FEMA regional administrator in any state along the Gulf Coast, just deputies.



Right now, rather than “lean” and “deployable,” it might be more appropriate to describe FEMA as  “starved and hobbled.” But ostensibly, a FEMA-review council assembled by the Trump administration is meant to offer a plan to overhaul the agency. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who praised the Trump administration's response to the flooding as “swift and very robust,” sits on that council. At a gathering of the council on the Wednesday after the floods (at which Abbott was absent), Noem reiterated her desire to see FEMA “eliminated as it existed” and “remade.” The council's recommendations are due in November.

 The administration does seem to understand that its plans to rapidly remake FEMA have real drawbacks. Noem has retained FEMA employees who looked like they'd be let go; Trump said last month that he intends to phase out FEMA only after this hurricane season. But reporting in recent days suggests that the administration is softening its tone on FEMA even further, at least for the moment. The Washington Post reports that the promised dissolution may in fact look more like a “rebranding.” Reality sets in fast in a disaster.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Spencer Kornhaber perfectly articulates the ersatz nature of pop culture today. Something I think he missed about modern pop music, though, is the relatively infrequent use of instruments. The listener can feel the emotion of a song created using actual instruments. It's the difference between fast food and a home-cooked meal. I think this helps explain the moment country music is having; listen to country, and you'll hear a real guitar or violin. It makes me wonder if music can survive otherwise.

Andrew Brown Wilmington, Del.

I was delighted to see my local radio station, KMUN, mentioned in Spencer Kornhaber's article. A community-supported station in a rural area of the Pacific Northwest, KMUN is itself an institution fighting against the decline of popular culture. The station has a small staff, and many programs are provided by volunteers. There's lots of folk music, yet each show has distinct music and artists. The same is true of the station's classical programs. A few shows frequently have musicians in the studio performing on air. Local residents discuss current events and issues and can even propose their own programs to present, after taking a class in radio technology.

Kornhaber's article focuses on cultural conformity, and yet here's good old KMUN doing radio with variety, purpose, eccentricity, and community. I hope The Atlantic's readers will give it a listen!

Laurie Caplan Astoria, Ore.

I'm sincerely thankful to Spencer Kornhaber for talking with Ted Gioia. I know the headline of Kornhaber's article calls to mind the year 1971, but the great fragmentation of our culture dates even further back. Early-20th-century philosophers warned that the “mechanization of culture” would undermine the meaning and purpose of life. ChatGPT and other AI technologies seem to be the culmination of that trend.

David Thomas Rockville, Md.

As I reviewed the list of the artists mentioned in Spencer Kornhaber's article, I wasn't surprised that so many people think contemporary music is in decline.

To those people I say: Cécile McLorin Salvant, Waxahatchee, Black Pumas, St. Paul & the Broken Bones, boygenius and its individual members, Lianne La Havas, Samara Joy, Wet Leg, Indigo Sparks, Joan Shelley, Lake Street Dive, Lucius, Sierra Ferrell, Dana Gavanski, Khruangbin, Leon Bridges (or Khruangbin and Leon Bridges), Bahamas, Amyl and the Sniffers, Nels Cline, I'm With Her, Rufus Wainwright, Laura Marling, Molly Tuttle, Billy Strings, and, and, and …

Anyone who thinks that the world is not awash in great music is simply not looking in the right places.

William Rogers Washington, D.C.

William Rogers points out a reassuring fact: If you look for it, you can still find most anything you seek in culture—including rock and folk musicians who faithfully adhere to 20th-century standards for excellence. But I want to push back against the notion, embedded in the other letters, that maintaining cultural health is mostly a matter of preservation. We should of course champion skilled instrumentalists and scrappy radio stations, and we should think critically about what's gained and lost in every technological transition. It is as important, and harder, to nurture greatness that's flourishing in new forms, using new techniques. We need maximalist, forward-charging art that can compete with, not simply provide refuge from, the attention-scrambling modern forces that might otherwise drive us into a dark age.

The term is applied to radically different compositions across more than 1,000 years of history, Matthew Aucoin wrote in the May issue. We need a better definition.

In his article about what he calls “written music,” Matthew Aucoin rightly laments the inability of cash-strapped public schools to teach musical literacy. Not so long ago, urban public schools were at times sites of world-class music education. Aucoin mentions Miles Davis in his article, so it's worth remembering that Davis often heaped praise in interviews on his first trumpet teacher, Elwood Buchanan, who worked for the public schools of his hometown, East St. Louis, Illinois. It was Mr. Buchanan, Davis said, who encouraged him to play light, fast, and without vibrato—three things that would soon become synonymous with the Miles Davis style. Elvin Jones, one of the most influential drummers in jazz history, had only a ninth-grade education but credited his musical development to his middle-school music teacher in Pontiac, Michigan. Meanwhile, in Chicago, a succession of jazz greats—Nat King Cole, Dinah Washington, and Gene Ammons, to name just a few—studied under the same inspiring teacher, Walter Dyett, who ran the music program at DuSable High School. A similar testimony appears in the biography of the legendary multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy.

This legacy of musical education reminds us of the power of public schools to nurture the next generation of talent. As Aucoin suggests, making sure those programs are fully funded today is a solid investment in the future of written music in this country.

Seth Kershner Hadley, Mass.

Bravo to Matthew Aucoin for his wonderfully insightful and enlightening article. I am a specialist in the field of musical notation, with the bulk of my career behind me. I was, as Aucoin puts it, the “modern-day equivalent of medieval monks laboriously copying out illuminated manuscripts.” It's true—I spent several years in apprenticeship under a professional copyist and then went on to prepare music for Broadway shows, films, symphony orchestras, operas, nightclub acts, commercials. All with pen and ink.

In part for this reason, I think it's worth writing an addendum to Aucoin's proposed description of classical music. His article deals mostly with music as an expression of the artist. I submit, however, that the need for music-notation literacy includes the world of commercial music, too. This would extend the benefits of musical literacy beyond the concert hall and into the general public; perhaps it could even make school music programs more relevant and less susceptible to budget cuts. Just as architects need construction workers to realize their expressive concepts, composers and songwriters need arrangers, orchestrators, and copyists.

Robert Nowak Tonawanda, N.Y.

As someone who has no musical aptitude but appreciates those who do, I enjoyed Matthew Aucoin's “What Is Classical Music?” But I have to disagree with his statement that “the written word is as prevalent today as it ever was.”

Northwestern's Medill School reports that in the past 20 years, the United States has lost more than one-third of its print newspapers. As a former president of my local library's board of trustees, I saw CDs, DVDs, artwork, and maker spaces take over floor areas that previously had been filled with books.

For many, the increase in time spent on social media and watching streaming entertainment correlates with a decline in time spent reading. Aucoin rightfully wishes that we Americans would spend more time listening. But we also need to spend more time reading.

Reforming environmental rules is only a small step to rebuilding after wildfires.

In the wake of the record-breaking wildfires in Los Angeles in January — some of the most expensive and destructive blazes in history — one of the first things California Gov. Gavin Newsom did was to sign an executive order suspending environmental rules around rebuilding. 

The idea was that by waiving permitting regulations and reviews under the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), homeowners and builders could start cleaning up, putting up walls, and getting people back into houses faster. 

But that raised a key question for housing advocates: Could California do something similar for the whole state? 

Earlier this month, Newsom took a step in that direction, signing two bills that would exempt most urban housing from environmental reviews and make it easier for cities to increase housing by changing zoning laws. Newsom also signed another executive order that suspends some local permitting laws and building codes for fire-afflicted communities with the aim of further speeding up reconstruction. 

Housing reforms can't come soon enough for the City of Angels. Blown by hurricane-strength Santa Ana winds over an unusually dry, grassy landscape, the wildfires that tore through LA burned almost 48,000 acres and damaged or destroyed more than 16,000 structures, including more than 9,500 single-family homes, 1,200 duplexes, and 600 apartments in one of the most housing-starved regions of the country. 

Los Angeles is a critical case study for housing for the whole state, a test of whether the Democratic-controlled government can coordinate its conflicting political bases — unions, environmental groups, housing advocates — with a desperate need for more homes. Revising the state's environmental laws was seen by some observers as a sign that the Golden State was finally seeing the light. 

But despite the relaxed rules, progress in LA has been sluggish. More than 800 homeowners in areas affected by wildfires applied for rebuilding permits as of July 7, according to the Los Angeles Times. Fewer than 200 have received the green light, however. The City of Los Angeles takes about 55 days on average to approve a wildfire rebuild, and the broader Los Angeles County takes even longer. (Los Angeles County has a dashboard to track permitting approvals in unincorporated areas.) 

“LA's process is super slow, so that's not surprising,” said Elisa Paster, a managing partner at Rand Paster Nelson based in Los Angeles and specializing in land use law. “Anecdotally, we've heard that a lot of people have decided they don't want to go through the process of rebuilding in LA because it is quite onerous.”

Now, half a year out after the embers have died down, it's clear that changing the rules isn't enough. Advocates for CEQA say the 55-year-old law is really a scapegoat for bigger, more intractable housing problems. Other factors, like more expensive construction materials and labor shortages, are still driving up housing construction costs, regardless of permitting speeds. And some environmental groups worry that the rush to rebuild everything as it was could recreate the conditions that led to the blazes in the first place, a dangerous prospect in an area where wildfire risks are only growing. 

CEQA is one of California's tentpole environmental laws, signed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1970. It requires that state and local governments preemptively look for any potential environmental harms from a construction project, like water pollution, threats to endangered species, and later, greenhouse gas emissions. Developers need to disclose these issues and take steps to avoid them. The law also allows the public to weigh in on new developments. 

In the years since, CEQA has been blamed as a barrier to new construction. Many critics see it as a cynical tool wielded to prevent new housing construction in wealthy communities, even being invoked to challenge highway closures and new parks on environmental grounds. It's one of the villains of the “abundance” movement that advocates for cutting red tape to build more homes and clean energy. 

However, CEQA isn't necessarily the gatekeeper to rebuilding single-family homes after wildfires, according to Matthew Baker, policy director at Planning and Conservation League, a nonprofit that helped shepherd CEQA in the first place. 

For one thing, CEQA already has broad exemptions for replacing and rebuilding structures and new construction of “small” structures like single-family homes. “Our general take is that the executive orders around revoking environmental review and environmental regulations around the rebuilding [after the fires] did little to nothing beyond what was already in existing law,” Baker said. He added that the vast majority of projects that face CEQA review get the go-ahead, and less than 2 percent of proposals face litigation.

But the mere threat of a lawsuit and the precautions to avoid one can become a significant hurdle on its own. “CEQA can be an expensive and lengthy process, especially for large or complicated projects. This is true even if there is not litigation,” according to a 2024 report from California's Little Hoover Commission, the state's independent oversight agency. “Preparation of an Environmental Impact Report under CEQA can take a year or longer and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even, in some cases, more than $1 million.”

In addition, CEQA does come into play for people who want to make more extensive changes to their property as they rebuild, like if they want to expand their floorspace more than 10 percent beyond their original floor plan. The law is also triggered by broader wildfire risk reduction initiatives, namely brush clearance and controlled burns, as well as infrastructure upgrades like putting power lines underground to prevent fire ignitions or installing more pipelines and cisterns for water to help with firefighting. Exempting these projects could help communities build fire resilience faster. 

For multifamily homes like duplexes and apartment buildings, CEQA can be an obstacle, too, if the developer wants to rebuild with more units. “We have multifamily buildings in the Palisades that had rent-controlled units, and what we've been hearing from some of these property owners is like, ‘Yeah, sure. I had 20 rent-controlled units there before, but I can't afford to just rebuild 20.' Those people want to go back and build 50 units, 20 of which could be rent-controlled, or all of which are rent-controlled.” By bypassing CEQA, higher-density housing has an easier path to completion. 

Rebuilding after fires is always going to be expensive. Your home may have been built and sold in the 1970s, but you'll have to pay 2025 prices for materials and labor when you rebuild. California already faces some of the highest housing costs in the country and a shortage of construction workers. The Trump administration is pushing the price tag higher with tariffs on components like lumber and its campaign to deport people. About 41 percent of workers in California's construction industry are immigrants, and 14 percent are undocumented. 

But even before they can rebuild, one of the biggest challenges for people who have lost their homes is simply becoming whole after a loss. “From the clients that I've spoken to, they've had to argue with their insurance company to get full replacement value or reasonable compensation, and that's where they're getting stuck,” said David Hertz, an architect based in Santa Monica. 

On top of the tedious claims process, insurance companies in California have been dropping some of their customers in high fire-risk areas, leaving them no option besides the FAIR Plan, the state's high-priced, limited-coverage insurer of last resort. But after the multibillion-dollar losses from the Los Angeles fires, the FAIR Plan had to collect an additional $1 billion from its member companies, a move that will raise property insurance prices. People who can't get property insurance can't get a mortgage from most lenders. 

There's also the concern of exactly where and how homes are rebuilt. In 2008, California updated its building codes to make structures more resistant to wildfires, but bringing burned-down old homes to new standards in high fire risk areas adds to the timeline and the price tag. 

“There's this tension between all of us wanting to have people be able to rebuild their homes in their communities, and there's the question of ‘Are we just going to build back the same thing in the same unsafe place? Are we going to try to do things better?” Baker said. 

All the while, wildfires are becoming more destructive. Wildfires are a natural part of Southern California's landscape, but more people are crowding into areas that are primed to burn, and the danger zones are widening. That increases the chances of a wildfire ignition and makes the ensuing blazes more damaging. 

With average temperatures rising, California is seeing more aggressive swings between severe rainfall and drought. The 2025 Los Angeles fires were preceded in 2024 by one of the wettest winters in the region's history, followed by one of the hottest summers on record, and bookended by one of the driest starts to winter. It created the ideal conditions for ample dry grasses and chaparral that fueled the infernos. 

“The question is, how does one really exist within a natural system that's designed to burn?” Hertz said. Reducing wildfire risk on a wider scale requires coordination between neighbors. 

For example, Hertz said that in many of the communities that burned, there are likely many residents who won't come back. Neighbors could coordinate to buy up and swap vacant land parcels to create a defensible space with fire-resistant trees like oak to serve as fire breaks and water storage to help respond to future blazes. Hertz himself leads a community brigade, trained volunteers who work to reduce wildfire risk in their neighborhoods.

He also cautioned that while there's a lot of well-deserved pushback against regulations like CEQA, the reasoning behind it remains sound. Development without any environmental considerations could put more homes in the path of danger and destroy the ecosystems that make California such an attractive place to live. 

“I think there's a balance,” Hertz said. “Nature doesn't have its own voice.”

At the same time, without speeding up the pace at which California restores the homes that were lost and builds new ones, the housing crisis will only get worse. The state will become unlivable for many residents. Long after the burn scars fade and new facades are erected, communities will be altered permanently.

Former President Barack Obama ripped Big Law firms for caving to the Trump administration just to protect their careers and fund their lavish lifestyles.

Obama was speaking at a private fundraiser in New Jersey on Friday when he expressed disappointment at how some of the country's top law firms had ""set aside the law"" in the face of President Donald Trump's attacks.

Obama said some lawyers were giving way to Trump not because they were ""going to be thrown in jail, but because they might lose a few clients and might not be able to finish that kitchen rehab at their Hampton house.""

""I'm not impressed,"" Obama said, per remarks obtained by MSNBC.

Obama's ties to Big Law go back to his Harvard Law School days. After his first year of law school, the former president worked as a summer associate at Sidley & Austin. 

Before entering politics, Obama worked as a civil rights attorney at the litigation firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland.

Since February, Trump has issued executive orders targeting Big Law firms like Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling. In his orders, Trump accused the firms of weaponizing the judicial system and stripped them of their security clearances. He also ordered reviews of each firm's contracts with the government.

Some law firms, such as Paul Weiss and Kirkland & Ellis, struck deals with Trump and promised to do pro bono legal work for conservative causes. Others, like Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, chose to fight back and filed lawsuits against the Trump administration.

In his remarks, Obama took aim at universities that chose to find room for compromise with Trump.

Obama's alma mater, Columbia University, gave in to the administration's demands after it slashed $400 million in federal funding. The Trump administration said the cuts were because of the university's failure to combat anti-semitism when protests over Israel's war in Gaza erupted on campus.

""If your core mission, if your core value is to teach, you may teach without compromising values of academic independence. Yeah, you may lose some grant money temporarily. That's why you have those big endowments,"" Obama said on Friday.

Obama has continued to be a vocal critic of Trump and his administration.

Last month, Obama told attendees at The Connecticut Forum on June 17 that the US was on the verge of becoming an autocracy under Trump.

""We're not there yet completely, but I think that we are dangerously close to normalizing behavior like that,"" Obama said.

Representatives for Obama did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Will he or won't he? That's a question nobody needs right now now.

Donald Trump dressed down Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office when they met on Feb. 28, 2025.

There's a lot Donald Trump has failed to do to pressure Russia into genuine peace talks on Ukraine. But it's now being reported he asked President Volodymyr Zelenskiy if he could do the one thing that nobody in their right mind would suggest: bomb Moscow, the capital city of a paranoid nuclear superpower, using US long-range missiles.The White House says Trump was “just asking a question, not encouraging further killing.” Not knowing the identities or even nationalities of the unnamed officials cited in Tuesday's Financial Times article, it's hard to judge motivations for the leak or why the US president might ask such a question. But given that he already boasted of threatening during his first term to “bomb the sh*t out of Moscow” if Putin attacked Ukraine, it can't be dismissed out of hand that he was serious.I'm going to guess that Trump's claim to have threatened Moscow — made on the campaign trail and recorded by CNN - was just one more among countless falsehoods that he's made for political ends. In this case, it would be to prove his otherwise ridiculous claim that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine had he remained in power after 2020. And if only to sleep soundly, let's likewise assume that whatever Trump asked of Zelenskiy on July 4, it won't result in the US handing over state-of-the-art missiles marked for Moscow.Given its merciless pounding of Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine, Russia needs to suffer a cost that deters it from continuing its unprovoked invasion. But which cost? Trump shied away from applying much safer forms of pressure on Putin as recently as Monday, when he announced that all future US military transfers to Ukraine will have to be paid for by others (meaning that fewer weapons will be sent), and that he'd impose new sanctions to punish Putin's warmongering only after another 50-day reprieve.And that's when he was supposedly getting tough. Since returning to office, Trump hasn't just refused to authorize any new aid for Ukraine, he at times interfered with the shipment of arms – including for air defense – already authorized by his predecessor and en route to Kyiv. He also gave away key Ukrainian negotiating cards before talks with Russia even began, including acceptance that the country would never join NATO.These were at best acts of enormous naivete on Trump's part, requiring him to believe that if he made unilateral concessions to a career KGB officer who has mired himself in Europe's largest war since 1945, the favor would be returned. Like many others, I've been quick to point out these mistakes, often justified by Trump and his supporters as bids to avoid World War III.In the same way, former President Joe Biden was correctly criticized for overestimating the risk that Putin would carry through with bluster about unleashing nuclear war in response to Ukraine getting supplied with conventional US weapons, from Himars multiple launch rocket systems to Abrams Tanks. All these US hesitations were misjudgments that cost Ukrainian lives.

But to offer American missiles to bomb Moscow would be an altogether different matter. A success would humiliate Putin, a man who measures himself by his imperial predecessors in the Kremlin. It would expose his inability to defend even his own capital in a war he has falsely cast as collective act of Western aggression.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The AI Race:

Anthropic joins a growing number of AI companies trying to attract customers in the financial services sector. 

Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is launching a package of new software services aimed at streamlining work for financial analysts, joining a growing number of AI companies vying to win business from Wall Street professionals. 

The new offering, called Claude for Financial Services, is designed to help analysts conduct market research, handle due diligence and make investment decisions, Anthropic said on Tuesday. The product pairs Anthropic's core enterprise and coding AI tools with information from third-party financial data providers, including FactSet, PitchBook and Morningstar, for customers with subscriptions to those services.“This is the missing piece between an AI tool that's interesting and cool, and one that's deeply useful,” said Mike Krieger, chief product officer at Anthropic and co-founder of Instagram. “Right now, there's a real moment of: If we don't adopt these tools, we'll be left behind by people who are doing it.”OpenAI and Perplexity AI have also added features in recent months to attract customers in the financial services sector, with the goal of expanding the business uses of AI and boosting sales. While Anthropic is smaller than OpenAI, its revenue is growing at a fast clip. The startup's annualized revenue increased from $3 billion to $4 billion in the past month, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly on private matters. Anthropic is looking to further its sales momentum with a new hire. The company has recruited Paul Smith, a former executive at ServiceNow Inc., to join as its first chief commercial officer later this year, the person said. Krieger said Anthropic has already picked up traction in the finance sector in part because its AI excels at coding, which is often used in financial analysis. The new tools are meant to expand on that by helping finance professionals with investment memos, portfolio analysis and financial modeling, among other tasks.

In this article

Apple and miner MP Materials announced a $500 million deal Tuesday for rare earth magnets and the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker's U.S. supply chain.

MP Materials stock climbed 24%. Shares of Apple were marginally higher.

As part of the agreement, Apple will buy rare earth magnets created at the company's facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Both companies will combine on a new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. MP Materials plans to start shipping magnets in 2027.

""American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we're proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. ""Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States."".

Apple said the deal will create dozens of new manufacturing and research and development roles.

Rare earth magnets are key components that make up everything from consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers to cars and renewable energy systems.

For years, the U.S. has worked on curbing its reliance on China, which dominates the global rare earth elements supply chain. MP Materials operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S.

Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner, buying $400 million in preferred stock to improve rare earth magnet supply on American soil.

Apple announced a plan to invest more than $500 billion to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities earlier this year. The plan included a new factory for artificial intelligence servers in Texas.

Shares of MP Materials have nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, pushing the miner's market capitalization to nearly $10 billion. The stock has nearly doubled over the last month.

Baidu has struck a partnership with Uber to deploy its autonomous cars on the ride-hailing giant's platform outside the U.S. and mainland China.

The first deployments are expected to happen in Asia and the Middle East later this year. The two companies said the multi-year partnership will see ""thousands"" of Baidu's Apollo Go autonomous vehicles on Uber globally.

Baidu shares jumped 4.5% in premarket trade in the U.S. following the news, while Uber stock was more than 1% higher.

For Baidu, the move will help to internationalize its driverless car business outside of China. Uber will meanwhile gain a proven partner to take on autonomous driving rivals around the world.

After the launch, a rider requesting a trip on Uber may be given the option to hail a driverless Apollo Go car, the two companies said.

In China, Baidu has been operating its own robotaxi service since 2021 in major cities like Beijing, letting users hail an Apollo Go car through the app.

But the Beijing-headquartered company has stated its ambitions to expand its operations to other international markets. This year, Baidu announced plans to begin autonomous driving testing and services in Dubai, while CNBC reported that the company is also looking to expand into Europe.

By partnering with Uber, Baidu has found a company with a widely-used app and that operates in 15,000 cities globally. Uber meanwhile has looked to partner with driverless technology companies after selling its own autonomous vehicle unit in 2020.

""As the world's largest platform of its kind, spanning mobility, delivery, and freight, Uber is uniquely positioned to help AV leaders like Baidu bring their autonomous technology to the world,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a press release.

This year, Waymo, the driverless car company owned by Google-parent Alphabet, began offering robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas through the Uber app. In the U.K., Uber partnered with startup Wayve to launch trials of fully autonomous rides in the country.

As private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin develop reusable rockets and push aspirations for lunar and Martian colonization, real estate investors are dialing in. Some liken it to the early days of the railroads, when entire towns grew up around new lines. One of the biggest plays is lunar and deep space data centers.

Hines, a global real estate investment, development and management firm, recently announced the acquisition of the Titusville Logistics Center, a nearly 250,000-square-foot, Class A industrial property located in Florida's Space Coast submarket. The property is fully leased to aerospace tenants. This is just one example of investors looking to capitalize on the boom in the space exploration sector's real estate needs.

""A real revolution has happened in the industry, and as things start to get unlocked, companies are looking for how they can monetize space more broadly, and there's a lot of pieces to that,"" said David Steinbach, global chief investment officer at Hines. 

Steinbach points to both infrastructure support here on Earth, as well as real estate development for manufacturing on the moon. It may sound futuristic, but it's already underway.

""We are in the early days of something that will be some major investments, and we're creating these new rails of the future. In this case, it's more into orbit instead of on the ground, but when you think about it that way, think about all the nodes that are going to get developed and created. It's exciting, and I think investors need to be thinking that way,"" he said.

One of those rails is data centers. They are going up at a quick pace all over the world, and at the same time sucking up more energy than most local grids can handle. Putting them in space offers a fully decarbonized energy solution. 

""There is unlimited power in space because of the sun, there is unlimited cooling with the vacuum of space, and there's unlimited real estate in terms of where you can put these things,"" said Steinbach.

The data centers could be built on the moon and either kept there or launched into space. The data would simply be beamed back to Earth.

Several companies are already working on construction methods for the moon, including 3D printing. ICON, a Texas-based construction technology company, is collaborating with NASA on developing 3D printing technology for construction on the moon and Mars. NASA is providing support through its Small Business Innovation Research program. 

And a California startup called Ethos says it has the technology for a moon-based cement ready to go, making it out of the moon's primary material, anorthosite.

""Ethos takes the geological resources on the moon, and it turns them into buildable props,"" said Ross Centers, the company's CEO. ""It's a whole new world waiting to be developed, and we develop it. We turn it into landing pads, roads, foundations for data centers and other great things.""

Centers said Ethos can also use anorthosite to make raw materials for solar panels, conductors and other materials needed to build data centers and other industrial facilities. And he pointed to the massive proliferation of rocket launches that will only multiply. He calls that his ride.

""People are really excited about this vision. This is something that people have been looking for. It's not every generation that you get a whole new continent to unlock,"" said Centers. 

Industrial warehouses here on Earth will still serve the space economy, Centers said, providing capacity for all the things that will be transported into space as well as areas for space-driven manufacturing. 

But the warehouse sector overall is getting softer now, with vacancy rates at 8.5% in May nationally due to tariff uncertainty, according to Yardi Research. That's up 290 points in the prior 12 months. Just 86.9 million square feet of new warehouse space was started as of May, on pace for the lowest annual total since 2018.

Steinbach admits that industrial broadly is seeing some headwinds in the U.S., and some submarkets – particularly the distribution centers for big box stores – are feeling that more than others. But he also said there are certain markets that are very undersupplied, and the space-support sector is one of them. That's in both Florida and Texas.

Steinbach argued there needs to be more development, more capital going toward construction of the infrastructure necessary to support this space real estate race. But, as with everything else, higher interest rates are holding it back. If rates come down, he said, the capital will come. 

""I think the capital is looking for great opportunities. They're looking for great returns, and this is one of them,"" Steinbach said.

Anthropic on Tuesday announced Claude tools for financial services as part of the artificial intelligence startup's latest attempt to court enterprise customers.

The so-called Financial Analysis Solution can help financial professionals make investment decisions, analyze markets and conduct research, Anthropic said. It includes the company's Claude 4 models, Claude Code and Claude for Enterprise with expanded usage limits, implementation support and other features.

""What this is is a tailored version of Claude for Enterprise,"" Kate Jensen, Anthropic's head of revenue said at an event in New York City on Tuesday. ""It's specifically built for financial analysts, and it's equipped for the nuance, accuracy and reasoning that you need to handle the complexity of your work.""

As part of its new Financial Analysis Solution, Claude will get real-time access to financial information through data providers like Box, PitchBook, Databricks, S&P Global and Snowflake. Anthropic said many of these integrations are available on Tuesday, with more to come.

Anthropic's Financial Analysis Solution and Claude for Enterprise are available on AWS Marketplace. The company said Google Cloud Marketplace availability is coming soon.

The Amazon-backed AI startup was founded by former OpenAI research executives, and its debut product was the Claude chatbot in March 2023. 

Anthropic announced its latest models, Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, in May, roughly nine months after it rolled out its business product called Claude for Enterprise.

Anthropic's Claude models and AI assistant have exploded in popularity as more businesses work to incorporate generative AI across marketing, sales and other customer service functions.

As of March, Anthropic closed its latest funding round at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation.

Alphabet's Google will invest $25 billion in data center and artificial intelligence infrastructure over the next two years in states across the biggest electric grid in the U.S., the technology company said Tuesday.

Google will also spend $3 billion to modernize two hydropower plants in Pennsylvania to help meet the growing power demand from data centers and AI in the region, according to the company.

The refurbishment of the Pennsylvania plants is part of broader a framework agreement that Google signed with Brookfield Asset Management to purchase 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power across the U.S.

Google's investments in the region come as the PJM Interconnection is struggling to keep up with rising electricity demand from data centers and industry. PJM is the biggest electric grid in the nation, covering 13 states across the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest and South. It includes the world's largest data center market in northern Virginia.

President Donald Trump, White House Cabinet officials, tech and energy executives are meeting at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh on Tuesday to discuss AI investment in Pennsylvania.

In this article

Wells Fargo beat second-quarter profit estimates on Tuesday but cut its 2025 guidance for net interest income, sending the shares of the lender down 2% in trading before the bell.

The bank expects its interest income to be roughly in line with the 2024 level of $47.7 billion. In April, it said NII growth would be at the low end of the 1% to 3% range.

Wells Fargo said lower interest income in its markets business led to the NII forecast cut. Analysts and investors were skeptical about its ability to meet its interest income targets after a slow start to 2025.

""While there continue to be risks..., activity levels have remained consistent and our strong credit performance continues to point to the strength of our commercial and consumer customers' financial position,"" CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement.

The bank had expected its NII, or the difference between what it earns on loans and pays out on deposits, to be relatively stable in the first half of 2025, with more growth in the second half.

Heading into the results, some analysts expected the bank to cut its NII forecast as elevated interest rates weighed on demand from borrowers.

""A modest reduction in NII guide was attributed to the markets business, which it said would be largely offset by higher non-interest income, so we expect overall revenues for 2025 to remain near the current consensus,"" said Stephen Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research.

Meanwhile, provision for credit losses fell to $1.01 billion in the quarter from $1.24 billion a year ago, helping profit to grow in the second quarter.

The fourth-largest U.S. lender's net income was $5.49 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the three months ended June 30, it said on Tuesday. That compares with $4.91 billion, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time costs, the lender earned $1.54 per share compared with expectations of $1.41, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.

Investment banking fees rose 9% to $696 million in the quarter, driven by higher advisory fees.

Last month, the U.S. Federal Reserve lifted Wells Fargo's seven-year-long $1.95 trillion asset cap, allowing the bank to pursue unimpeded growth.

Wells Fargo has been focused on fixing its regulatory problems in recent years. While it labored under a $1.95 trillion cap asset cap, rivals expanded.

With the asset cap lifted and regulatory issues largely in the rearview mirror, Wall Street analysts expect Wells Fargo to attract more investor interest as its profits grow.

""We now have the opportunity to grow in ways we could not while the asset cap was in place and are able to move forward more aggressively,"" Scharf said.

Wells Fargo is likely to beef up its wholesale businesses by adding market share in commercial banking, corporate and investment banking and trading.

Scharf has said the bank will expand carefully. It has closed seven regulatory punishments, known as consent orders, this year and 13 since 2019. It still has one remaining consent order from 2018.

""The asset cap removal is expected to take some time for benefits to ramp up and be effective at more aggressively growing NII,"" Argus Research's Biggar said.

Wells Fargo had 212,804 employees as of June 30, compared with 215,367 at the end of March. Its headcount has fallen every quarter since late 2020.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he has reached a deal with Indonesia, a week after he threatened to slap a 32% tariff on the southeast Asian country's U.S. exports.

Trump in a Truth Social post called it ""great deal, for everybody,"" and said it followed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

He provided no other information about the purported deal, but said details would follow.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" later Tuesday that as part of the agreement, Indonesia would drop its tariffs on U.S. goods.

""He announced Indonesia just this morning. No tariffs there. They pay tariffs here,"" Lutnick said.

Indonesia is one of the United States' top 25 trade partners, with the two countries trading more than $38 billion in goods in 2024, according to the Commerce Department. The U.S. trade deficit with Indonesia totaled $17.9 billion last year.

Trump's post on Indonesia closely resembles his July 2 announcement that the U.S. reached a trade deal with Vietnam.

Trump's initial message about Vietnam was also short on details, though he declared in a follow-up post that the terms included a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports.

Vietnamese officials were reportedly surprised about Trump's description of their preliminary deal with the U.S. As of July 10, the Vietnamese government still has not formally accepted part of the deal Trump touted, Politico reported.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for additional information about the purported deal with Indonesia.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday as worries over U.S. inflation and a mixed bag of big bank earnings dragged the blue-chip index lower. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a boost from gains in Nvidia.

The 30-stock Dow lost 313 points, or 0.5%. The The Nasdaq jumped 0.5%, lifted by a more than 4% rise in Nvidia shares after the chip company said it hopes to ""soon"" resume deliveries of its H20 GPU sales to China. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, easing from a fresh record high it reached earlier in the session.

June inflation data released Tuesday represented an increase from May levels, despite the headline numbers matching expectations. The consumer price index increased 0.3% on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, matching a consensus poll from Dow Jones. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew 0.2% month over month, slightly less than expected. Year over year, it expanded by 2.9%, matching estimates.

The print spurred fears about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1.

""The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June,"" said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy.

""While there was a mild miss in the core number, both the main and underlying inflation measures are now printing at their highest levels in four months. The big fear for Fed officials is that stormier waters lie ahead, as not only is there a time lag between the tariffs and an increase to prices, but additional tariff hikes on 1st August would almost certainly herald further inflationary pressures ahead,"" Ryan added.

Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report coming in-line with expectations, but that ""it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming.""

On the earnings front, reports from several financial heavyweights failed to impress investors.

Wells Fargo beat earnings, but a reduction in net interest income guidance sent shares lower by more than 4%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged lower even though the bank posted better-than-expected second-quarter results driven by strong trading and investment banking revenue. Asset manager BlackRock slipped more than 6% on a quarterly revenue miss.

Citigroup bucked the negative trend in financials, rising about 1% after the bank topped second-quarter estimates.

Wall Street is hoping that the second-quarter earnings season will boost a stock market that's already near all-time highs. Expectations are low ahead of the reports, however. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. That would be mark the lowest growth rate for the index going back to the fourth quarter of 2023.

While Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally remains optimistic that the Trump administration will come to a negotiated tariff deal that will be a positive for automakers, he is cautious on Tesla. ""We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL,"" he wrote, citing several factors for his concern.

McNally said ""long-term negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated,"" with fiscal 2026 earnings per share on pace to be about 85% lower than 2022 predictions. He's also worried about a disappointing autonomous vehicle rollout, ""divisive political posting,"" and technical moves in the stock that are on the edge of turning negative. Tesla stock has fallen more than 21% year to date, but was slightly positive in Tuesday's session.

In the near term, McNally said he is expecting second-quarter profits in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents per share, which is below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 44 cents.

The S&P 500 has posted 55 days above its 20-day moving average, the longest such streak going back to January 2021 when it was 56 days, according to BTIG. The 20-day moving average, which indicates short-term trends, is at around 6,144. 

The long streak is a bullish long-term signal for the stock market, suggesting the S&P 500 can continue to climb higher now that it's back to trading around all-time highs. But, over the near term, it suggests the broad market is due for a pullback.  

""We are clearly stretching the limits of time without a 20 DMA break, and former such streaks often led to periods of volatility or consolidation,"" BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky wrote Monday. 

""We think at a minimum we see a test of ~6144 as we head into the back-half of July as volatility enters a a seasonally strong period, and likely something closer to the 6k level heading into August,"" he added.

Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials jumped more than 25% Tuesday on a $500 million deal to supply Apple with magnets that are manufactured at a plant in Texas.

MP will provide Apple with rare earth magnets made from recycled materials at its Independence plant in Forth Worth. The input materials come from end-of-life magnets, the miner said.

The deal comes after MP announced last week that the Pentagon was purchasing a direct equity stake, sending the miner's shares skyrocketing about 50%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, following an inflation report that showed prices rising but mostly in line with market expectations.

""Consumer Prices LOW. Bring down the Fed Rate, NOW!!!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social site.

In a separate post, Trump called for a 3 percentage point reduction.

""Fed should cut Rates by 3 Points. Very Low Inflation. One Trillion Dollars a year would be saved!!!"" he said.

The statements followed a report showing the consumer price index in June rose 0.3%, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation also moved higher, rising 0.2%, with a 2.9% annual rate.

The tax-and-spending bill formerly known as the ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" has been passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Donald Trump. But as the massive piece of legislation comes into force in the coming year, Americans will begin to see a host of changes to tax policy stemming from the bill.

Passed earlier this month, the legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and includes additional provisions that impact deductions, overtime pay, charitable giving, Medicaid and more. Some of the bill's provisions may have unwelcome side effects, CNBC's Jon Fortt reports.

University endowments are an example of a major change to tax policy that didn't receive as much attention in the run up to the votes in Congress as other provisions did.

For universities with smaller endowments, the tax rate will remain the same. But for schools with endowments between $750,000 and $2 million, the rate will increase to 4%. That doubles for universities with endowments greater than $2 million.

Schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students will be exempt from the tax.

""The tax increase will impact some of the top research universities in the country,"" CNBC's Sharon Epperson said. ""Experts say the higher tax will hit about 15 schools. In 2023, 56 universities paid about $380 million under the endowment tax.""

It's possible that universities may also try to modify their endowment strategies to avoid the tax hits, Epperson added, potentially by offering more scholarships to reduce the number of tuition-paying students to reach tax-exempt status.

The bill also has ramifications for charitable giving that could impact individual philanthropic decisions.

Charitable giving increased to a record $590 billion last year, according to CNBC's Robert Frank. The new charitable deductions are aimed at encouraging everyday Americans to give more – but they also have consequences for the wealthy, who constitute a large portion of that record giving.

""Now to pay for that, it requires itemizers, i.e. the wealthy, to exempt from their charitable deduction the first half a percent of their gross income,"" Frank said. ""So if you're lucky enough to make a million bucks a year, your first $5,000 given to charity cannot be deducted at all.""

The megabill also limits charitable deductions for earners in the top tax bracket, which could disincentivize America's wealthiest donors.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill's provisions would add more than $3 trillion the deficit.

Republicans and the Trump administration dispute that, however, and insist that the baseline for the total cost of the bill should presume that the tax cuts which are being extended now were always going to be extended. They argue that the cost of extending the cuts should not be factored in to the overall cost of the GOP bill.

But unless the tax cuts had been extended with a new bill like this one, they would have expired at the end of this year. And the cost of not letting them expire, specifically all the tax revenue that will not be collected by the federal government, because people got tax breaks — adds up to trillions of dollars over 10 years, according to the CBO.

Experts say there needs to be one universally accepted standard for tax cut and deficit projections, however.

""I think the irony of this, and what really demonstrates how disingenuous that argument is, is that at the same time in this new tax bill, there are a number of new tax cuts on tips and overtime and other things, all of which would expire and all of which they don't assume are permanent when it comes to costing them out,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

""So the bottom line is, if you're going to add, say, $4 trillion in borrowing, you either need to recognize it when you create the tax bill or when you extend the tax bill, but you can't switch how you account for it in the beginning and at the extension time, and then pretend it's free,"" MacGuineas added.

Here's a tariff we can get behind. At a White House meeting on Monday with NATO's secretary general, Mark Rutte, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would introduce ""tariffs at about 100%"" on Russia's trade partners if the Kremlin doesn't reach a deal to end its invasion of Ukraine in 50 days.

Notably, the punitive measures will be implemented as ""secondary tariffs,"" Trump said. Unlike Trump's normal tariffs, under which a specific country is slapped with a levy, secondary tariffs impose the duty on countries and entities that buy Russia's exports.

While those moves were meant to weaken Russia's economy, they do run the risk of drawing other countries' ire. According to data from the International Trade Centre, in 2024, Russia's biggest export was oil, and its biggest buyers were China, India and Turkey, in that order. That means those nations, among others, would effectively face a tariff of 100% from the U.S. — the highest of all updated numbers announced so far — if they don't shift their buying patterns.

That said, it's refreshing to think of tariffs not as a weapon in a trade war (even if there might be collateral damage), but being used for peace.

China's second-quarter economic growth beat expectations. Compared with a year earlier, gross domestic product expanded 5.2%. While that figure topped the 5.1% estimates in a Reuters poll, it marks a deceleration from the previous quarter's growth of 5.4%.

Trump threatens 100% tariffs on Russian export buyers. The U.S. president said he will impose ""secondary tariffs"" on Moscow if the country doesn't end its war on Ukraine in 50 days.

The White House will allow Nvidia to resume chip exports to China. The semiconductor company said Tuesday that the U.S. government has assured Nvidia it will be granted licenses to export H20 chips to Beijing. Nvidia's H20 chips were specially designed for the Chinese market.

In this article

Shortly before a road trip in early 2024, Mary Molina realized her view of Target had changed.

Molina, a mother of five and entrepreneur who lives in Westchester, New York, said her weekly trips to Target looked and felt different from her experience before the Covid pandemic. Items such as national brands of laundry detergent or shampoo were often out of stock. She said store employees weren't as friendly as before, with heads down or eyes glued to a handheld device as they picked orders for an online shopper. And when she browsed for the cute and trendy swimsuits, pajama sets or sandals she had typically found at Target, she said it felt like ""a sea of generic.""

""It was a small evolution, and then one day, my husband said, 'Let's stop at Target and then we'll go to Rhode Island,'"" she said of preparing for the road trip. ""And I said, 'What for?'""

Molina and customers like her reflect a fading loyalty to Target that's testing its business model and slowing its sales.

The retailer, which gained a loyal following over decades for its quirky, progressive and chic approach to big-box retail, now appears stuck as it tries to grow again and bounce back from lower store traffic, inventory issues and customer backlash. Shares of Target have fallen about 61% since their all-time high in late 2021. That peak came after Target's sales rose more than $15 billion in the fiscal year following the start of the Covid pandemic, but its annual revenue has stagnated for the past four years. And Target said in May that it expects sales to fall this year.

Target leaders have described the weaker performance as a blip, pointing to higher inflation or other temporary factors, and expressing confidence in its long-term strategy. In May, Target said sluggish sales resulted from weaker discretionary spending, uncertainty about President Donald Trump's tariffs and backlash to its decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

But customers, former employees, vendors and analysts painted a picture of a company at an existential crossroads. In interviews with CNBC, they attributed Target's struggles to the weakening of unique traits that helped the retailer stand out, including its eye-catching merchandise, attentive staff, well-kept stores and commitment to celebrating diversity through both the items that it sold and the policies it supported.

Multiple former employees, who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said Target's store standards have slipped in recent years as the company has tried to juggle online and in-store businesses with a leaner store staff — leading to items being out of stock. Customers and analysts also told CNBC they have seen longer checkout lines, messier aisles and fewer employees at stores. Plus, former employees said Target's sharp turn away from diversity efforts, along with cost cuts, hurt corporate culture and employee morale.

""They have kind of lost their identity,"" said a former employee, who worked for the company for nearly a decade but left recently to work for a competing retailer.

The bulk of the work to turn Target around will likely fall to a new chief executive. CEO Brian Cornell is 66 years old, and in September 2022, Target said he agreed to stay in the role three more years. The company has not disclosed when that contract expires or named his successor.

Investors have speculated about who will lead the company after Cornell — and what that internal or external pick may mean for the company's future.

Cornell took the helm at Target in 2014, another troubled time in the company's history. He started as CEO after ex-CEO Gregg Steinhafel resigned following a data breach that compromised the personal information of as many as 110 million people — equivalent to roughly 1 in 3 Americans at the time.

Target said it believes it can rebound again from its current low point, as it invests in store renovations and plans to open 300 more locations over the next 10 years. Target declined interview requests for this story, but provided a statement from Cornell, who said the company is ""built for long-term, profitable growth,"" boosted by its store fleet, growing digital business and brand partnerships.

""Backed by strong assets, proven capabilities and a talented team, we're confident in our ability to accelerate near-term performance while continuing to innovate and serve our guests—today and in the years ahead,"" he said.

The company announced several key changes in May as it tries to revamp its business. Target said it was starting an Enterprise Acceleration Office to speed innovation and rev up sales. It tapped Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a Target veteran of more than 20 years who also served as chief financial officer, to lead the new effort. He is considered a potential successor to Cornell.

The announcement of the new office coincided with another shakeup. Target said two key executives would depart: Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington, another CEO candidate discussed in industry circles, and Chief Legal and Compliance Officer Amy Tu, a retail veteran who was at Target for less than a year.

Through word of mouth and social media, Target's name became synonymous over the years with fashion-forward finds for less. The retailer's creative approach to merchandise — including exclusive brands and limited-time collaborations with fashion designers — sparked stories of shoppers who went to the store for one item but left with a basket full of merchandise they didn't know they wanted.

The discounter's cheap chic approach inspired some customers to call the retailer ""Tarzhay,"" a nickname that evoked French high fashion.

Target turned its giant stores into a mall-like experience where suburban shoppers could order a Starbucks coffee and spend hours browsing the aisles for lipsticks, throw pillows or new outfits. And it attracted time-crunched customers by making it possible to pick up a gallon of milk or box of diapers without leaving the car.

At its July 2021 peak, Target's market cap catapulted to about $129 billion — after Americans sought retail therapy during the pandemic and splurged with stimulus checks and money they weren't spending on travel, dining out or other activities. Since then, the ""Tarzhay"" formula hasn't translated in the same way. Target's market cap has tumbled to about $47 billion.

As a retailer known for selling discretionary items, Target has been vulnerable to high inflation and economic uncertainty. Rival Walmart is the nation's largest grocer, and only 40% of its sales come from discretionary items, compared with about half at Target, according to estimates by GlobalData Retail.

Yet analysts, employees and even the company have said Target faces issues that go well beyond the economy. On an earnings call in the spring, Target's leaders admitted the company is losing some of its shoppers.

Target held or gained market share in 15 of its 35 merchandise divisions in the first quarter, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said in May. Put another way, it lost ground in the majority of categories that it sells.

Duller merchandise has driven some of those customer losses, said Stacey Widlitz, retail consultant and president of SW Retail Advisors.

""They're not as edgy as before,"" she said.

Widlitz said Target's brand collaborations haven't seemed as exciting, either. Target's recent partners have included weaker brands than they did in the past.

For example, Target launched a collection in the spring with Parachute, a direct-to-consumer bedding and bath company that shuttered some of its stores as it faced financial difficulties. Target announced a new line that will debut this fall with Champion, a sportswear brand it previously dropped from its stores.

Target, however, pointed to collaborations that have drawn shoppers in. The company said its recent Kate Spade collection was its strongest limited-time designer partnership in a decade.

Company leaders have touted other moves to revamp its image — including Warby Parker pop-up shops that it's testing at a handful of stores later this year. Gomez also described the new line with Champion — which hasn't hit store shelves yet — as ""really the epitome of Tarzhay.""

Even the Kate Spade collection didn't launch unscathed. Some shoppers poked fun at items in social media posts and mused that Target may be losing its sharp eye for design.

They pointed to Kate Spade-branded black and cream garbage bags, priced at $10.

Some suppliers said Target is taking fewer bets on emerging brands as it tries to boost profits. Private label products, which drive higher margins, and national brands, which tend to have more recognition and pricing power, are taking up more shelf space instead, said an executive of a company that advises and represents national brands carried by Target, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of speaking about a business partner.

That profit-focused strategy comes with ""a risk of missing the next big thing,"" especially at a retailer known for being a place where shoppers discover fresh items, the executive said.

""If people feel like they're not getting what they expect from Target, then there's nothing special at Target for them,"" the executive said. ""So why not go to Aldi or another mass [retail] location?""

Decades-high inflation in recent years forced Target to cut prices to stay competitive. But the company has a difficult balancing act, as it faces pressure from investors after its operating income margin fell below typical levels following the pandemic.

Widlitz said Target has gotten stuck in a loop of marking down merchandise to motivate buyers. The wave of promotions began in summer 2022 when Target started to sell through a glut of unsold inventory, such as small kitchen appliances and bicycles, that consumers no longer wanted as they prioritized experiences.

Trump's tariffs have not helped Target's efforts to become more profitable, because, the company said, roughly half of its merchandise is imported.

Target has announced major price cuts, including on 10,000 household items, such as butter, baby wipes and laundry detergent in 2024. And it recently pledged to maintain year-ago prices on key school supplies — moves made to woo value-conscious customers and compete better with discounters such as Walmart and off-price players such as T.J. Maxx.

It's also leaned into new revenue drivers that have higher profits, including its advertising business, Roundel, and its third-party online marketplace, Target Plus. The company said both of those segments grew by double digits in the fiscal first quarter.

At the same time, Target's competitors have turned up the heat and taken some pages from its playbook.

Walmart, for example, has launched more fashion-forward private brands, including a new clothing and accessories brand, Weekend Academy, for tweens that debuted this month. It's also added more items to Bettergoods, a grocery brand with trendier flavors and colorful packaging that launched in 2024 and is reminiscent of Target's own Good & Gather line.

Those brands have contributed to the big-box rival's gains with wealthier households.

Walmart has gained market share from Target, according to Indagari, a data analytics firm that analyzes billions of debit and credit card transactions from U.S. shoppers to understand consumer behavior and company performance. After customers churned from Target, about half made their next purchase at Walmart and about 30% made their next three purchases at Walmart, the firm found. It calculates churn as customers who lapse from shopping with a brand over an extended period of time, based on the average shopping cadence.

The number of Target's customers who are shopping with other competitors, including Costco, Aldi and Trader Joe's, in the same quarter, has increased over the past five years, the firm's data showed.

Newer entrants, such as Chinese-owned Shein and Temu, have also taken market share from Target, according to Indagari. The percentage of Target consumers who are shopping with Shein in the same quarter has risen from about 5% in early 2021 to nearly 10% in early 2025.

Some of Target's challenges are the byproduct of recent success.

Target's annual sales jumped more during fiscal year 2020, at the start of the Covid pandemic, than its total sales growth over the prior 11 years.

But that also brought growing pains that are still tripping up the discounter.

Inventory troubles have lingered beyond the pandemic at Target. In the most recent quarter, the company said inventory was up 11% year over year, and its profits took a hit from markdowns and cancelled orders.

In social media comments and CNBC interviews, shoppers said Target has lost a quality that put the retailer a cut above other retailers: Tidy and easy-to-navigate stores.

Trouble finding items at Target drove Molina — the Westchester, New York, mom — to other retailers. She said she now buys more from Walmart and Amazon and makes Target trips once every two or three months instead of every week.

Molina said she cut Target slack when the pandemic hit. As a founder of Lola Snacks, a nutrition bar company, she said she understands the challenges of retail. Her products were sold on Target shelves for about a year, before Molina decided to focus on grocers located closer to home.

""I gave them a lot of leeway because of all this turmoil, but it never seemed to correct itself,"" she said.

On a trip to a Target store in early July, she said she saw many empty shelves, and the only employee who acknowledged her was the security guard.

Other customers have grown frustrated by Target locking up deodorant, razors and other everyday items, a tactic Target has used to try to prevent theft. Cornell raised eyebrows in 2023 when he said shoppers had a ""positive"" response to the policy and had said ""a big thank you"" for it because products were in stock.

Barclays retail analyst Seth Sigman cut the retailer's price target in late June and said the company appears to be losing some of its most loyal customers. Sigman wrote in a research note that the firm's analysis of shopper transaction data indicated that it has had a more pronounced drop among people who historically shopped Target more than eight times per year. 

On the company's earnings call in May, Cornell said Target is focused on retail fundamentals, including making sure ""we're in stock every time you shop."" Fiddelke also told analysts that in-stocks had improved from a year ago.

Target's e-commerce business, which boomed during the pandemic, brought new opportunities and challenges, too. Digital sales rose from about $6.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended in early 2020 to nearly $21 billion in the most recent full fiscal year that ended in early 2025 — a more than 200% jump. The retailer's curbside pickup offering, Drive Up, now accounts for nearly half of the retailer's total digital sales.

Target has capitalized on that popularity by tacking on more perks, such as allowing shoppers to make returns or get a Starbucks drink without unbuckling their seatbelt.

Yet two former employees, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said Target's stores have struggled with a tradeoff of whether to prioritize brick-and-mortar stores or the online business. Target's stores act as hubs for online fulfillment, with about 96% of total digital volume fulfilled at the locations in the most recently reported quarter, according to the company.

The employees said that juggle contributed to out-of-stocks on store shelves and weaker customer service as they raced to keep up with online orders.

As sales stagnated, the company cut costs, which lowered store payrolls and took a toll on employees' morale, the employees said. Among those cuts, stores received fewer shipments of Target-themed swag to hand out to reward employees, said a six-year employee who recently retired. And the recognition budget for stores got slashed, which meant less money for snacks or coffee in the break room or gatherings like pizza parties, the retiree said.

The employee said low morale contributed to other problems, including more store workers calling out and falling behind on unloading trucks or straightening up store aisles — all of which can hurt the customer experience.

Alice James said she saw those store quality issues on a recent trip to her local Target in Austin, Texas. As she shopped for bras at the location, she said merchandise was scattered across the floor, bras weren't organized by style or size and a rack of inventory intended to stock the department was parked and abandoned.

James said Target has lost sight of its ""secret sauce"": its friendly employees, engaging store displays and fun in-person shopping experience.

James, president of a fashion consulting company, said Target's rollback of key diversity initiatives was a turning point for her, too. Her clients include a small brand that lost out on business opportunities when Target pulled Pride merchandise from shelves two years ago.

""There was a joy to shopping at Target,"" she said. ""It made you feel good. And I don't have that same feeling when I walk through Target.""

For the first time in about two decades, there was no Target float in the Twin Cities Pride parade this June.

The public split between Target and Twin Cities Pride, the nonprofit that throws the parade in Target's hometown, captures how brand loyalty has weakened among some shoppers who have objected to the company's flip-flop on its Pride collection and DEI stance.

Twice in the past two years, Target has backed away from diversity and inclusion efforts that some customers associated with its identity as a retailer. The company in 2023 pulled some merchandise from its Pride line, an annual collection that it has sold for more than a decade, after it said its employees faced safety threats. It also rolled back major DEI initiatives in January, just days after Trump signed executive orders to end similar programs in the government.

At the same time, Target has also taken heat from conservative customers who objected to the company's sales of Pride merchandise for children and tuck-friendly swimsuits for adults, and received praise for its decision to join Tractor Supply, Walmart and Facebook parent Meta in backing away from DEI after Trump's criticism of those policies.

Target has made other moves that customers and employees have said are out of step with the company's image. It donated $1 million to the Trump Inauguration fund, its first donation to a presidential inauguration in at least a decade.

It is difficult to measure how much backlash to Target's social and political stances contributed to sales declines, especially since the company's annual revenue flattened out before the two controversies. However, Target said in May that customers' reaction to the DEI decision hurt its sales.

Cornell also reached out to and met with civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton for a meeting in April, a sign the company has paid attention to the risk of boycotts.

Shoppers once seemed to have a clear idea of what Target stands for — but that has changed among some, even in the company's backyard. Twin Cities Pride cut ties with Target in January after the discounter's DEI rollback.

Target used to give about $50,000 per year to the nonprofit and was one of its biggest donors, said executive director Andi Otto. But the company also contributed in many other ways. Target donated candy and supplies for the organization's trunk-or-treat Halloween event. It helped stock the Rainbow Wardrobe, a gender-affirming closet that community members could shop for free, with clothing and personal care items.

""Target was always that phone call I could make and say 'Hey, this is what I need from you.' And they would show up every time,"" Otto said.

Then came Target's DEI decision. After a discussion with Twin Cities Pride's board, Otto said he sent an email from the nonprofit that expressed disappointment in Target's move and turned down future donations or sponsorships. To help close the gap, the organization put up a crowdfunding link and raised about $113,000 in total, he said.

Store traffic for Target has declined year over year nearly every week since the week of Jan. 27, days after the company's DEI announcement, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations. Target traffic had been up weekly year over year in the four weeks before that.

The only exceptions to that were the two weeks on either side of Easter, when traffic rose less than 1% year over year, the firm's data showed, a sign of the company's strategy of driving sales with holiday and seasonal merchandise.

Michael Lasser, a retail analyst for UBS, said customers' connection to the Target brand deepened loyalty through the years. Yet those same emotional ties have amplified reactions to the company's decisions, he said.

""Target customers have such strong feelings about the retailer,"" he said. ""It can create more risk as these polarizing issues become front and center.""

The employee who left Target recently after about a decade with the company said the change in DEI policies was jarring for workers after they had seen the company take a more progressive stance on social issues.

""We had invested all of the time and energy into these programs,"" he said. ""And then that just disappears out of nowhere.""

The employee said the moves clashed with Target's past positions, including taking a public stance on its website in 2016 about allowing employees and customers to use the bathroom and fitting room that aligned with their gender identity.

After George Floyd's murder by police a short distance from Target's Minneapolis headquarters, the company expanded its diversity goals for its workforce and suppliers. It gave $10 million to support social justice groups. And it distributed free T-shirts to its employees, including one with an all-caps message: ""Target stands with Black families, communities and team members committed to using our size, scale and resources to help heal and create lasting change,"" according to photos seen by CNBC.

Cornell and other top executives had been vocal in their support for diversity — which customers and employees said led to shock about its DEI rollback. In 2021 remarks, Cornell recalled thinking, ""That could have been one of my Target team members"" when watching the video of Floyd pinned to the ground.

On a store tour with reporters in December 2022, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester recounted Target's commitment to having holiday items that reflected its customers. She said a mom wrote a thank you note to Target after her young Black daughter saw a ballerina Christmas ornament with the same skin color as her own.

That about-face on diversity issues has contributed to Target's problems with loyal customers. And it's just one challenge Cornell and his successor will have to resolve to bring back shoppers.

Otto, who was born and raised in Minnesota, said he grew up going to Target and would typically shop there four times each week. Yet he hasn't shopped there since January, he said.

""The community right now feels like they were lied to,"" he said. ""And if Target wants to go back to the company we thought that they were, they are going to have to repair that damage.""

A bitcoin BTC$117,316.73 whale holding more than 80,000 BTC sold a chunk their hoard following bitcoin's ascent to an all-time high around $123,000 on Monday.

The user, who mined the cryptocurrency during the earliest days of the industry — a period known as the Satoshi era after the pseudonymous bitcoin creator — sold 9,000 BTC ($1 billion) via Galaxy Digital, Lookonchain posted on X. 

Users with particularly large amounts of BTC, known as whales, have the ability to move the market when they buy or sell bitcoin because of the substantial number of tokens involved.

Satoshi-era bitcoin whales are closely monitored by traders for market signals, particularly when the BTC in their wallets has not moved for a number of years. 

The Satoshi era refers to a loose period of between 2009 and 2011 when bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was active in the community and BTC was generally priced in cents. 

The world's largest cryptocurrency fell from Monday's high, dropping below $117,000. Such a slide is quite common following a surge as many users sell coins to bank some profits. 

Bitcoin was recently priced just above $117,000, around 4.55% lower than its peak.

Bitcoin crosses $123K all-time high before retracing. Bitcoin Magazine Pro analyst Matt Crosby breaks down what on-chain and macro data reveal about the market.

Bitcoin has once again captured the spotlight after surging to a new all-time high of $123,000, followed quickly by a sharp $7,000 retracement—raising the question: Have we just seen the top of this cycle?

In a recent analysis by Matt Crosby, lead analyst at Bitcoin Magazine Pro, the implications of this price action are explored in depth using a suite of on-chain indicators and macroeconomic data.

Crosby points to two key on-chain indicators signaling short-term caution:

These indicators hint that while the move to $123K is significant, it may be ahead of network fundamentals, suggesting a temporary overbought condition.

Despite near-term volatility, Crosby emphasizes the broader bullish structure of the cycle:

Crosby notes this mirrors patterns from earlier in the cycle where new capital inflows ignited major price surges following consolidation.

Macro indicators also add context:

Despite these factors, the broader liquidity environment and risk appetite remain supportive. As Crosby explains, these are “temporary blips, not trend reversals.”

While short-term consolidation or a pullback is likely, Crosby remains firm in his bullish long-term stance. The current price action, in his view, aligns with previous cycles where new all-time highs were often followed by dozens more, not a hard peak.

“If we zoom out and focus on macro and on-chain trends,” Crosby concludes, “there's still significant upside potential left in this bull cycle.”

British banking giant Standard Chartered became the first ""too big to fail"" bank to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading through traditional currency platforms on Tuesday, crossing a line that its peers have cautiously approached for years.

The bank will run Bitcoin and Ethereum spot trading services for institutional clients from its U.K. branch, enabling them to execute trades through the same foreign exchange systems they already use.

“Digital assets are a foundational element of the evolution in financial services,” Bill Winters, group chief executive at the bank, said in a statement. The move, he said, opens “new pathways for innovation, greater inclusion and growth.""

Unlike crypto exchanges that require separate accounts and systems, Standard Chartered's approach integrates digital assets into the platform's treasury departments, which fund managers use daily for trading dollars, euros, and yen.

Through it, clients can settle their crypto trades with any custodian they choose. The bank also offers its own regulated custody service, launched in the UAE last year and Europe this January. It later expanded those offerings through a partnership with FalconX in May.

Standard Chartered's entry to spot crypto trading is ""unequivocally validating the growing demand from traditional finance for regulated, deliverable crypto trading solutions,"" Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, a digital asset financial institution based in Hong Kong, told Decrypt.

Tam pointed to a ""convergence of TradFi and digital assets,"" which shows how the sector's ecosystem has matured as established players like Standard Chartered ""tailor their offerings"" to meet the sophisticated needs of institutional clients.

While the launch marks a first for a bank of its stature, Tam views the move as part of a broader shift among institutions exploring crypto, seeking ""diverse ways to manage risk and gain exposure.”

The development signals a more decisive direction and momentum toward ""full integration within mainstream financial infrastructure,” Tam claimed.

Comparing it to brokerage platforms such as Robinhood, Tam said the offering “complements existing spot BTC or ETH ETFs by offering an additional, direct trading rail” for institutions, through infrastructure they're already familiar with.

While retail platforms “opened the door for millions,” an offering from Standard Chartered, by contrast, “paves the way for deeper institutional confidence,” Tam said.

Tam sees particular significance in Standard Chartered's status as a “G-SIB,” or Global Systemically Important Bank.

StanChart is one of just 29 such institutions designated by the Financial Stability Board as ostensibly “too big to fail,” meaning their collapse could threaten global financial stability.

These institutions face the world's toughest banking rules, including extra capital requirements, loss-absorbing buffers, and strict crisis planning.

Decrypt has approached Standard Chartered for comment on how the service differs from retail platforms, what prompted the launch, and whether it plans to expand to other assets or derivatives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum becomes preferred treasury asset for tech-savvy firms: Ray Youssef","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-key-treasury-asset-corporations-ray-youssef","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 13:09:31 GMT","

 The NoOnes CEO told Cointelegraph that corporations are increasingly adding Ethereum to their treasuries, drawn by its utility, staking yield and dominance in tokenized assets protocols. 

Corporations are increasingly viewing Ethereum as a critical infrastructure component, fueling a surge in ETH allocations within corporate treasuries, according to Ray Youssef, CEO of finance app NoOnes.

“Ethereum starts to look like a hybrid between tech equity and digital currency. This appeals to treasury strategists looking beyond passive storage,” Youssef told Cointelegraph.

Top corporate Ethereum treasuries have purchased at least $1.6 billion worth of Ether (ETH) in the past month. On Monday, BitMine, chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, revealed that it holds 163,142 ETH, valued at around $480 million.

SharpLink Gaming, founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, leads corporate ETH holdings with over 280,000 ETH as of Sunday, totaling over $840 million. It has acquired large amounts in recent days.

Other notable corporate buyers include Bit Digital, which has more than 100,000 ETH, and Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS), which increased its holdings to 29,122 ETH following a $62.4 million raise. GameSquare also announced a $100 million ETH treasury plan.

Youssef said the shift shows utility now rivals narrative in driving institutional choices. “Bitcoin has long held the title of digital gold standard, but Ethereum is gradually winning over institutions that seek to align their balance sheet with the networks that drive tokenized finance,” he said.

Youssef said ETH's staking yield, programmability and compliance-friendly roadmap have made the cryptocurrency appealing to “forward-looking companies, especially those already involved in the digital economy.”

He predicted that Ethereum's influence will continue to grow. “Ethereum increasingly becomes the digital rail for tokenized assets, stablecoins, and smart contract execution, becoming a preferred reserve cryptocurrency for firms operating in these areas.”

Most stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) protocols are built on Ethereum or Ethereum-compatible chains. According to RWA.xyz, Ethereum dominates the RWA market with 315 projects valued at $7.76 billion, commanding a 58.1% market share.

Following behind is the Ethereum layer-2 solution ZKsync Era, hosting 37 projects worth $2.27 billion and holding nearly 17% of the market. Solana ranks third with 79 projects valued at $553.8 million and a smaller 4.15% market share, though it showed the strongest growth rate of 22.28%.

Youssef called Ethereum's dominance in tokenized US Treasurys the beginning of broader adoption for onchain debt, equity and yield products. “Ethereum provides the standards and liquidity for these instruments to thrive,” he said.

Related: Bit Digital shifts treasury strategy with 100K ETH buy; stock surges 29%

Meanwhile, Youssef noted that regulatory uncertainty remains a key barrier to ETH treasury adoption. He said there is a need for better guidance on how staking is classified, whether it counts as a service, a security or something different.

For corporations to jump in, they also need clarity on accounting, tax treatment of staking rewards and custody standards. “Large corporations tend to move slowly because they can't afford legal ambiguity. Once those boxes are ticked, adoption will accelerate.”

A new weekly “On Chain” report from Bank of America is shining a spotlight on Ethereum. According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress.

Ethereum's role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike.

Stablecoin Legislation Under The Lens

Based on reports, this week's Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill.

House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar's global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows.

Rails For The Future

Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure.

That nod isn't just for the token itself. It's a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum's code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. Institutions Bet On Ether 

The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts.

Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum.

Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale.

It isn't all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum's lead. Still, the network's mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start.

For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday publicly called on all Republicans to vote in favor of the GENIUS Act, a sweeping crypto bill aimed at positioning the United States as the global leader in digital assets during what is now being billed as ""Crypto Week.""

What Happened: Taking to social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “Happy Crypto Week! The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets – Nobody does it better!""

Calling the GENIUS Act ""tremendous,"" Trump said it would put the U.S. ""lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others,"" and asked that ""ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!"" 

The move signals his administration's growing embrace of crypto-friendly policy, setting a sharp contrast with regulatory approaches under previous leadership.

“It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE,” Trump stressed in idiosyncratic fashion.

Why It Matters: The GENIUS Act, short for Guiding Enhanced National Innovation for Unified Standards, is expected to clarify how cryptocurrencies are regulated across federal agencies.

Provisions in the bill address key industry issues like token classification, stablecoin frameworks, and U.S. competitiveness in blockchain development.

This vote comes amid ""Crypto Week,"" an unofficial term used by industry insiders to describe the flurry of legislative and executive activity this week in support of digital assets. 

Alongside the GENIUS Act, additional bills are expected to clarify how securities laws apply to blockchain tokens and establish new rules for stablecoin issuance.

While not expected to impact price action in major currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD, the bills will impact the regulatory framework cryptocurrencies like XRP XRP/USD operate under.

The GENIUS Act is seen by supporters as the first concrete step toward creating a U.S.-led digital economy infrastructure.

House lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill later today.

Bitcoin and most altcoins pulled back on Tuesday, raising concerns among investors about whether the crypto bull run is over.

Bitcoin (BTC) plunged from Monday's high of $123,200 to $116,600, while the market capitalization of all coins fell by over 3.7% to $3.65 trillion. Some of the worst-performing tokens were Pump (PUMP), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), SPX6900 (SPX), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), respectively. 

Bitcoin and most altcoins declined due to profit-taking among investors. It is common for cryptocurrencies and stocks to pull back slightly after going parabolic. For example, BTC reached a record high of $109,389 in January, then pulled back to $74,450 in April.

Cryptocurrencies are also falling as market participants await the outcome of “Crypto Week.” Republicans will consider three bills this week, including CLARITY, GENIUS, and one related to central bank digital currencies.

The GENIUS Act, which passed in a bipartisan manner in the Senate, sets the rules for stablecoins. CLARITY aims to divide the cryptocurrency regulatory roles between the SEC and the CFTC, while the CBDC bill prohibits the Fed from working on these currencies.

Therefore, Bitcoin and altcoins are falling because market participants are not sure whether these bills will pass in Congress. Many of them remember Donald Trump's “Infrastructure Week” during his first term. His goal was to secure $1 trillion to fund the country's infrastructure, which did not materialize.

Further, these coins are likely falling due to the concept known as “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Cryptocurrencies surged ahead of “Crypto Week” and are now declining as the event unfolds.

The crypto pullback is also happening due to technical factors. The chart above shows that Bitcoin price formed a shooting star pattern on Monday. This pattern, characterized by a small body and a long upper shadow, is one of the most common bearish reversal signals.

Bitcoin is also falling due to mean reversion, where an asset returns to its historical averages. In this case, BTC surged above $123,000 on Monday, significantly higher than the 100-day moving average of $103,000 and the 50-day average of $108,200. As such, mean reversion suggests that BTC may keep falling to bridge this gap.

Bitcoin also appears to be executing a break-and-retest pattern by moving back to the key support at $110,000. This B&R pattern is a common continuation signal in technical analysis.

Therefore, this is unlikely to mark the end of the crypto bull run. The more probable scenario is that BTC drops to $110,000 and then resumes its uptrend, potentially triggering another rally among altcoins.

Bitcoin has broken records, but the rest of the crypto market is still playing catch-up.

While top cryptocurrency tore through $123,000 this week, most altcoins — everything that isn't Bitcoin — are lagging behind.

So, when are the cryptocurrencies not named Bitcoin going to enjoy their bull market?

“For a full-scale altcoin rally, we need two things: profit rotation and confidence,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News. 

“Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively.”

For now, it's a one-man show. 

This month, Bitcoin has enjoyed a 12% price rally as three crypto bills worm their way through Washington, exchange-traded fund inflows remain stable, a wave of corporates buy Bitcoin, and the anticipation the Federal Reserve cutting interest rate grows.

Altcoin season — the market phase when tokens like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP outperform Bitcoin — is often seen as the next leg in the crypto cycle. 

But Enzersdorfer-Konrad says we're not quite there yet.

“The biggest driver for altcoin performance in the coming weeks and months is going to be investor sentiment and overall risk appetite,” he said.

The setup may be forming.

Bitcoin is consolidating near all-time highs. And real yields are still low — a recipe, Enzersdorfer-Konrad says, for capital to flow into higher-risk bets like DeFi, gaming tokens, and tokenised real-world assets.

Still, the spark hasn't lit.

That's because Bitcoin is yet to consolidate at a price level, allowing investors to start moving down the risk curve.

Enzersdorfer-Konrad is cautious about whether that will soon translate into new price records for the likes of Ethereum, XRP and Solana. 

A lot “will depend on overall market sentiment, global liquidity, and whether investors are ready to move further out on the risk curve,” he said. 

“It's less about individual names and more about the broader setup taking shape.”

Oops, something went wrong

Amaze Holdings (NYSE:AMZE) launched a new cryptocurrency initiative on Tuesday. The initiative aims to modernize payments, boost monetization, and enhance financial flexibility.

This move builds on the company's recent rollout of Express Checkout and expanded payment offerings.

Amaze is partnering with DNA Fund to develop blockchain-based payment and treasury solutions as part of the initiative.

“Partnering with DNA Fund accelerates our ability to reduce cross-border payment friction and deliver faster, more flexible solutions to our growing base of international creators,” said Aaron Day, CEO of Amaze.

Day added that the collaboration enables the company to offer new payment options to over 13 million creators, while also improving the purchasing experience for millions of visitors to the platform.

He stated that the partnership opens the door to broader opportunities—such as providing creators access to funding and helping them build sustainable businesses—marking a critical step toward becoming a true partner in the global creator economy.

Within 60–90 days, Amaze will roll out Phase One, focused on stablecoin integration to accelerate international transactions and reduce costs.

According to DNA Fund Chairman Brock Pierce, future phases may include digital treasury tools, creator-focused financial services, and a potential “Amaze Coin,” all developed with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance.

Price Action: At the last check on Tuesday, AMZE shares were trading higher by 2.89% at $11.73 premarket.

Lloyds

use of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as collateral for foreign exchange
(FX) trades in the UK, working with digital asset exchange Archax to handle the
transactions.

Aberdeen's money market fund as collateral for currency trades between the two
firms. Archax, which holds regulatory approval from the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA), processed and stored the digital tokens on the Hedera
Hashgraph blockchain.

The test
comes as UK financial institutions explore ways to reduce trading costs and
streamline operations. The country's daily foreign exchange and interest rate
derivatives trading volumes reach $5.4 trillion, representing roughly half of
global activity in these markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","OpenSea CTO outlines token trading vision for moving beyond NFTs","https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-cto-token-trading-nft-slowdown","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:32:30 GMT","

 OpenSea's strategic pivot comes as NFT volumes have declined in five straight quarters. 

Crypto trading platform OpenSea is expanding beyond non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as the space faces a consistent decline in digital collectible trading volumes amid increasing competition. 

On July 8, OpenSea announced that it had acquired the mobile-focused token trading platform Rally to push its expansion into mobile devices and enhance its token trading capabilities. The platform said it will build an “onchain everything app” to provide users with a new experience. 

Rally co-founder Chris Maddern, who now works as OpenSea's chief technology officer, told Cointelegraph that the move will bring together “the best of crypto,” putting everything in one place. 

“Consumers are ready to do more with their crypto. They'll come onchain to access the broad array of opportunities, assets and cultural experiences available there,” Maddern told Cointelegraph. 

Maddern told Cointelegraph that the vision for the new mobile-focused NFT platform is a place where crypto community members can find everything they need; the app will bring NFTs, tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi) in one application.  

“In short, when you think about doing more with your crypto than just hodling it, you'll open the OpenSea app,” he told Cointelegraph. 

When asked about Rally's role, Maddern said it will provide the foundation for the new OpenSea mobile experience. He said the team, with years of expertise in cross-assets and multi-wallet portfolios, would greatly contribute to OpenSea's new app. 

“Combining Rally's mobile token-trading capabilities with OpenSea's deep expertise and product advantage in NFTs will enable us to foster a truly multi-asset ecosystem where tokens and NFTs will thrive together,” Maddern told Cointelegraph. 

He added that the forthcoming app will also have artificial intelligence integrations. 

When asked how the app will use AI, he said it will include helping users with safety and allowing users to better discover what they want to do within the app. He added that it will also be used for educational purposes, in helping people learn.

Even though OpenSea remains the number one NFT marketplace in the space, it has long lost its monopoly on digital collectibles. Data tracker NFTScan shows that its competitors have been inching closer.

In the past year, OpenSea's market share was 37.93%. Its closest competitor, Blur, is right on its tail at 34.22%. The rise of competitors like Magic Eden, OKX NFT and Rarible has also saturated the NFT market, with more players sharing in the revenue as the trading volumes continue to decline. 

OpenSea's shift into tokens, DeFi and a focus on reaching mobile users comes as NFT trading volumes have declined in the last five quarters. 

On July 3, decentralized application (DApp) data tracker DappRadar reported that the NFT space showed a consistent drop in trading volumes since the second quarter of 2024. 

In the second quarter of 2025, trading volumes were $823 million, down 385% compared to the $4 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2024. 

OKX chief commercial officer Lennix Lai told Cointelegraph that the decline signifies the sector's maturity. He said that the focus is shifting from hype-driven sales to utility-based and community-driven transactions. 

While volumes declined in Q1 2025, the sales count increased. Lai told Cointelegraph that buyers were still eager to engage with NFTs even when the value of transactions had decreased. 

“I maintain that NFTs are more than a digital collectible,” Lai told Cointelegraph. “The market may be quieter in terms of high-value trades, but it is becoming more active, inclusive and utility-focused.”

            By Zak Thomas-Akoo
            - 15 Jul, 2025          


In a three-page objection filed on 14 July, Massachusetts resident Brad Wyatt, a former top 10 holder of NFL Reignmaker NFTs, criticised the Plan of Allocation's use of “Prize Receipts” as a deduction in calculating how much each class member will receive.

He claimed the approach distorts economic reality and undermines the settlement's goal of compensating harmed investors.

Wyatt is the third class member to object to the settlement, following two earlier objections submitted in May.

The lawsuit, led by plaintiff Justin Dufoe, alleges that DraftKings violated federal securities law by offering NFTs as unregistered investment contracts.

DraftKings denies wrongdoing but agreed in April to a mediated settlement that includes a $10m fund for affected users, with up to $50,000 set aside for service awards and 25% for legal fees.

Wyatt's objection centres on the formula used to determine “Individual Recognised Loss” (IR), which includes deductions for “Prize Receipts” (PR) from fantasy contests run separately on the DraftKings platform.

He said: “Including these Prize Receipts does not offset the economic harm suffered by class members as the proposed settlement regarding the purchase and sale of NFT securities on DraftKings Marketplace is unrelated to potential realised or unrealised prize receipts from playing in DraftKings Fantasy Sport skill-based contests”.

He further alleged that DraftKings inflated the fair market value of these prizes and that their inclusion in the formula results in “an unfair reduction of each class action participant's NFT owners' Individual Recognised Loss.”

Wyatt urged the court to adopt a revised formula that excludes Prize Receipts altogether, arguing that doing so would “better adhere to securities law principles and promote a more equitable distribution of damages”.

According to transaction data provided by DraftKings, Wyatt spent nearly $462,000 acquiring NFTs on the primary and secondary markets, but only received around $245,000 in resale and marketplace closure proceeds.

Prize Receipts accounted for an additional $252,000 in notional value, which Wyatt argues should not be treated as offsetting cash.

DraftKings shut down its NFT marketplace in March 2024, just weeks after the federal court declined to dismiss the securities lawsuit.

In the settlement memorandum, Dufoe's lawyers noted that the timing “suggests an awareness of litigation risk” and argued the $10m fund represents “an outstanding result” given the uncertain legal landscape.

A final approval hearing has yet to be scheduled, and objections remain open until 21 days before that date.

The court will determine whether to approve the deal as fair, reasonable and adequate in light of the objections raised.

                    While the market for NFTs crashed in 2022, the technology behind the phenomenon didn't go away. Instead, NFTs evolved to center around utility. Learn more.
                

Back in 2021, NFTs were everywhere — avatars in sunglasses were selling for millions, Beeple became a household name, at least in households with a MetaMask wallet, and the phrase “non-fungible token” was somehow dropped into late-night monologues with a straight face.

And then — nothing.

The crash came. Celebrities disappeared. Prices plummeted. Media coverage dried up faster than an open Discord during bear season.

And just like that, NFTs became a punchline. Another speculative bubble. Another “remember when?”

Except, they didn't go away.

 

After the 2022 washout, the NFT market didn't die — it shed its costume.

OpenSea, once the unchallenged auction house of the metaverse, lost over 90 percent of its trading volume from its peak. The gold rush mentality that had pushed everyday people to buy cartoon owls for the price of a down payment evaporated. Headlines moved on. Regulators turned their attention to crypto fraud. And for a while, it really did feel like NFTs had gone extinct.

But in the silence, a different story was unfolding — one too boring, too technical and too grounded to trend on X.

Behind the scenes, startups, platforms and brands started quietly rebuilding the NFT stack, this time without the get-rich-quick flash. Starbucks launched Odyssey, an NFT-based loyalty program wrapped in seamless UX. Ticketing companies began experimenting with NFTs as fraud-resistant digital passes. Gaming studios used NFTs to track ownership of in-game items — not to get rich, but to solve problems.

And something else happened: developers stopped talking about NFTs and just started using them.

Because here's the twist — the actual idea behind NFTs wasn't bad. It just had terrible PR.

More on NFTsHow Multi-Utility NFTs Are Redefining the Landscape

 

You won't see it on the front page of Bloomberg, but NFTs are being folded into real systems — quietly, usefully and often invisibly.

One of the most innovative examples of NFT adoption in loyalty programs is Nike's DotSwoosh platform. DotSwoosh NFTs allows users to purchase, collect and trade exclusive digital assets — providing holders with early access to Nike's future product releases, special edition sneakers and exclusive virtual wearables.

What makes DotSwoosh especially compelling is how it combines real-world value with digital ownership. Instead of creating just a static loyalty program, Nike has used NFTs to offer customers an evolving, interactive experience that connects the digital and physical worlds. Collectors of DotSwoosh NFTs gain access to unique benefits that are tied directly to Nike's future drops and promotions, bringing a new layer of engagement for their most loyal customers.

NFTs are increasingly being used to represent fractions of real-world assets — from real estate to fine art.

Want 0.01 percent of a building in Miami? There's an NFT for that.

It's not about flipping monkey JPEGs anymore; it's about making illiquid things liquid. This is where the infrastructure shift gets serious. Platforms like RealT and Mattereum are leading the way, making ownership portable, divisible and programmable.

Suddenly, NFTs don't just represent something — they are something.

In the world of blockchain gaming, NFTs are foundational — not for hype, but for mechanics.

Games like Illuvium, Guild of Guardians, and Parallel are building entire economies around in-game assets that players can own, trade or rent. This isn't just about skins — it's about shifting power from developers to users.

It's not without challenges, but in this space, NFTs are actually doing what they were always meant to do: define and enforce digital ownership.

A new class of NFTs is emerging at the intersection of AI and art.

These aren't static images. They evolve.

Think: generative portraits that respond to world events, or AI-trained characters that learn from your interactions. Projects like Art Blocks and BRAiN Drops are pushing this frontier, where NFTs are living systems — closer to code than canvas.

For all the flash and absurdity of 2021, the core idea behind NFTs was never about art or hype. It was about proof of ownership in a digital world. A wrapper for metadata. A programmable certificate that says, “This is yours.”

What we're seeing now isn't a comeback — it's a quiet graduation.

The best part? Most users won't even know they're using NFTs.

Much like the internet itself, NFTs are slipping into the background. They're becoming protocol-level tools — the kind that make systems work, not headlines. You won't hear people say, “I used an NFT today,” just like no one brags about visiting a website that uses HTTPS.

And that's the point. The less we talk about NFTs, the more useful they become.

If Web3 is going to matter, it won't be because of collectibles or clout.

It'll be because NFTs turned into invisible infrastructure — making ownership, access and interaction seamless across digital and physical spaces.

Yes, there is still a market for NFTs, however, the use-cases have changed. Instead of NFTs as a status symbol and collector item, they are being created as tools for loyalty programs, real-world asset tokens and as a part of Web3 gaming.

NFTs started as a bubble focused on status symbol items without a real world use-case. Once the gold rush mentality that pushed people to purchase cartoon apes evaporated, demand dropped, regulations increased and people stopped purchasing them. This led to the NFT bubble bursting. However, the technology behind NFTs remained and has led to the creation of a new market centered around utilization.","{'href': 'https://builtin.com', 'title': 'Built In'}","cryptocurrency"

Poker solutions provider Stretch Network has introduced ""Lift Only Up SN,"" a limited-time poker experience tied to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), developed in partnership with NFT marketplace Ortak.

The offering is designed to integrate digital collectibles with a jackpot mechanism that operates outside traditional poker tournament formats.

The program features a branded collection of 2,500 NFTs. Ownership of each NFT grants automatic entry into a shared jackpot pool. Stretch Network stated that the jackpot could be awarded at any point within a six-month period, with no prior announcement, providing NFT holders with an element of unpredictability.

Participants can also utilize Ortak's tools to create and sell their own NFTs. The platform enables players to generate additional income through revenue-sharing arrangements on sales.

Stretch Network is positioning the experience as a means for operators to engage poker players beyond standard gameplay options. Operators are encouraged to promote participation given the on-demand nature of the jackpot release.

Oops, something went wrong

It was another historic week in crypto as Bitcoin ripped to a new all-time high above $123,000 before retracing to $117,000. The rally was catalyzed by a mix of factors including renewed momentum as Washington lawmakers move to push focus on crypto-friendly legislation.

Altcoins were not left behind in BTC's ascent...or pullback.

Leading tokens in the Solana ecosystem brought back altcoin summer vibes with sharp gains. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) was a big mover, doubling in value.

The ecosystem followed suit as the combined market cap of Solana-based tokens rose by 13% and broke the $200 billion barrier. The trading volume climbed 100% as trading activities spiked.

And that's just part of the story. Read more in our weekly recap on Solana.

There are no brakes yet for corporate interest in Solana. Solana treasury firm Upexi raised $200 million across two financing rounds to ramp up its SOL acquisition strategy.

BIT Mining, a crypto miner on the NYSE, plans to raise up to $300 million with a similar goal: buy Solana in phases. Who is next in the Solana treasury race?

SOL responded with a steady climb. It reached a weekly high of $167 before settling at $161, marking a 7% week-on-week rise.

Meanwhile, Solana's flagship launchpad Pump.fun grabbed headlines. Its ICO

sold out in 12 minutes, raising $500 million. The Solana network executed nearly 75% of PUMP's token purchases.

Solana's total value locked (TVL) sank to $9.2 billion, down from last week's $10.2 billion. This reduced its market share to 7%, leaving it vulnerable to losing its second position.

Solana's DEX volume mirrored the sentiment in the crypto industry by rising 40% in a week, reaching $3.3 billion.

As the launchpad wars intensify, LetsBonk.fun is beating Pump.fun in weekly revenue and tokens graduated.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): +92.83% (the token exploded after Coinbase changed its X profile profile picture to a Pudgy Penguins NFT)

1inch Network (1INCH): +80.49%

Convex Finance (CVX): +65.65%

Mog Coin (MOG): +63.2%

Turbo (TURBO): +26.42%

WhiteRock and Keep Network, which led in losses last week, posted further declines. Is a reversal in sight?

Keep Network (KEEP): -31.36%

WhiteRock (WHITE): -19.69%

Grass (GRASS): -13%

Pump.fun (PUMP): -8.04% (PUMP is down over 50% from its July 12 all-time high)

Dog (DOG): -6.7%

Pump.fun has acquired Kolscan, a tool for mapping wallets tied to KOLs, as a core part of its plan to build a crypto-native social platform at scale.

A blockchain researcher accidentally burned $58,000 worth of Pump.fun's PUMP tokens on Solana while clearing spam from his wallet—but says he isn't upset by the loss, which stemmed from having mistaken the real tokens for fakes.

Tokenized assets on Solana rose 140.6% year-to-date to $418M, outpacing the broader RWA market and placing Solana fourth among blockchains.

Popular Solana token launchpad Pump.fun debuted its token on Monday, immediately entering the top 65 tokens by market cap. It followed a massive $600 million initial coin offering, or ICO, that sold out in just 12 minutes over the weekend.

Still, PUMP remains below BONK in terms of market cap, a meme coin project that is butting heads with Pump.fun as it steals Solana launchpad market share.

At the time of writing, Pump.fun sits at a market capitalization of $2 billion, according to CoinGecko, making it the 63rd largest cryptocurrency. To put that into perspective, that puts the project above the official meme coin for U.S. President Donald Trump and Sam Altman's World, formerly known as Worldcoin.

But rival project BONK is currently trading at a market cap of $2.23 billion—$230 million ahead of PUMP. To be clear, BONK launched as a Solana meme coin in late 2022. By January, it had started to pick up steam, slid, and then pumped as the developers burned 5 trillion coins to buoy the price.

The team and community that created Bonk have gone on to create a Telegram trading tool BonkBot, a dog charity Buddies for Paws, and more. Meme coin launchpad LetsBonk, which debuted in April, is the latest of those projects.

Last week, LetsBonk flipped Pump.fun in daily created tokens and has remained on top for seven out of the last eight days, according to Dune data. The launchpad was created by the Bonk meme coin community, hence its shared name with the token.

LetsBonk is very similar to Pump.fun in that it allows anyone to quickly launch tokens for free. However, LetsBonk also lets the deployer control the total token supply and is underpinned by Raydium's LaunchLab infrastructure.

Comparing the PUMP and BONK tokens isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, as the team behind the OG Solana meme coin has a wider catalogue of offerings. Bonk is integrated into dozens of DeFi projects, games, and dev tools, and even has its own stadium sponsorship. Whereas PUMP—which is a token and not a meme coin—is solely focused on Pump.fun.

That said, Pump.fun is undeniably one of the largest crypto projects to emerge in recent years, becoming the fastest crypto company to hit $100 million in revenue last year. Since then, it has topped $784 million in revenue, according to Dune data.

The platform allows anyone to create a Solana token in less than a minute, free of charge. It has resulted in more than 11.89 million tokens being created since its January 2024 launch, many of which have been viral successes—think Moo Deng, Fartcoin, and Chill Guy.

More recently, the project has invested more into expanding its streamer ecosystem by funding big streamer projects and paying users to post viral clips of their favorite Pump.fun creators.

Those bullish on PUMP are now eagerly awaiting details on when the launchpad will airdrop tokens to users of the platform. In its tokenomics, 24% of the supply was dedicated to “Community & Ecosystem initiatives,” which many believe suggests an airdrop is on its way. Predictors on Myriad Markets believe there is a 47.7% chance that Pump.fun airdrops by the end of July.

Pump.fun declined to respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.)

Throughout its first day of trading, PUMP has remained fairly stable, hitting a low of $0.0049, a high of $0.0061, and is currently sitting at $0.0055. At its peak, it was trading at a 65% premium over its ICO price of $.004.

According to Dune data, this prompted 21.6% of ICO participants to sell the token via decentralized exchanges and 43.4% to transfer it out of their wallets. It's worth noting that transferring tokens does not mean that the trader sold the tokens; moving tokens could simply mean splitting tokens among wallets.

Plus, 31.8% of public sale buyers have held their tokens, with 3.2% even acquiring more tokens post-launch.

Due to its lack of volatility, there doesn't appear to be any big winners trading PUMP yet with the top traders, according to DEX Screener, requiring millions of dollars to make sizable profits.

As you can expect, a stream of knock-off coins were launched alongside PUMP, including the Official Pump—which is very much not official. It peaked at a $3.13 million market cap and has since crashed 74.75%.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Pump.fun, a prominent meme coin launch platform on Solana, has successfully completed its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in an astonishingly short period of 12 minutes. The ICO raised $500 million by selling 125 billion tokens at a fixed price of $0.004 per token. This rapid sell-out positions PUMP as a significant player in the crypto market, marking it as the third-largest ICO in crypto history. The total funds raised, including a private sale that brought in approximately $700 million, amount to $1.2 billion.

The ICO took place on July 12, 2025, across six major exchanges and the platform's on-chain portal. On-chain data indicates that $448.5 million worth of tokens were sold through the website, with 10,145 wallets participating out of 23,959 KYC-approved users. This represents a 42.3% buy rate with an average purchase of $44,000 per wallet. The remaining $51.5 million was sold through the six participating centralized exchanges. All tokens sold during the ICO will be fully unlocked for trading within 48-72 hours.

PUMP has a maximum supply of 1 trillion tokens, distributed across several allocations. The ICO sale represents 33% of the total supply, while 24% goes to Community & Ecosystem Initiatives, 20% to the Team, and 13% to Existing Investors. At the Token Generation Event (TGE) scheduled for July 2025, tokens for the ICO Sale, Liquidity & Exchanges, Foundation, Livestreaming, and Ecosystem Fund will be fully unlocked. This means approximately 55% of the total supply will be in circulation immediately. The Community & Ecosystem allocation will vest linearly over 12 months, while Team and Existing Investors allocations are fully locked for the first year, then released gradually over five years.

A point of concern for many analysts is that about 40% of the circulating tokens after TGE will belong to the development team. This concentration of tokens raises questions about potential market manipulation. The lack of clear utility for PUMP, which doesn't offer staking, governance, or fee-sharing mechanisms, further adds to the concerns. The token is designed as a meme token, which differentiates it from other tokens in the market that offer more functional utilities.

Pre-market performance for PUMP has been robust, with futures contracts available on several derivatives platforms before the ICO. After the ICO launch, pre-market prices jumped from $0.0052 to $0.0072, and are currently trading around $0.0059 – approximately 47% higher than the public sale price. Trading volumes have been robust, indicating strong market interest.

The launch of PUMP comes during a period of “Extreme Greed” in the crypto market, with Bitcoin pushing to new highs. However, the Solana ecosystem shows signs of losing momentum, with memecoin transaction volume dropping by over 60% in Q2 2025. Pump.fun's daily revenue reached a peak of over $7 million on January 23, though it has since stabilized to approximately $1 million per day. Over the past year, the platform has generated over $723 million in fees.

Pump.fun faces increasing competition across various blockchains. On Solana, platforms like Raydium, LetsBonk, Believe, Moonshot, and Make Now are key competitors. LetsBonk has recently surpassed Pump.fun in Daily Tokens Deployed, adding competitive pressure. From late January onwards, Pump.fun has seen a decline, with weekly revenues and transaction fees dropping by more than 40% compared to its peak. This shift in market dynamics has forced the team to consider new strategies to maintain their position.

Some market observers have raised concerns about potential contradictions in Pump.fun's approach. The founder, Alon, previously criticized token presales and CEX listings, yet the project is now pursuing both strategies. With 55% of tokens unlocked immediately and the team controlling a significant portion, some analysts speculate the price could rise to $0.008-$0.01, potentially pushing the project's Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) to around $8-10 billion, especially if listings on major exchanges follow.

The token launch represents a test of community trust in a platform that initially gained popularity for its transparency and community-focused approach to token launches on Solana. The rapid sell-out and significant funds raised indicate strong market interest, but the lack of utility and potential for market manipulation remain areas of concern for investors and analysts alike.

US banking regulators have issued a joint statement outlining expectations for institutions engaged in the safekeeping of digital assets.

The announcement, made by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), emphasised that the guidance reflects existing regulations rather than introducing new policy directives.

The seven-page document addresses key operational requirements for banks handling crypto custody services, particularly the importance of controlling cryptographic keys in a way that aligns with current legal and regulatory obligations. It also covers areas such as anti-money laundering compliance, audit readiness, risk management, and technical competency.

The latest communication comes against the backdrop of a changing regulatory tone in Washington. Under previous leadership, US banking regulators had issued guidance that discouraged financial institutions from engaging with cryptocurrency businesses. That position has since softened, with recent statements from the agencies aiming to provide clarity rather than restrict involvement.

Officials from the three agencies stated that the guidance is meant to reinforce how existing supervisory frameworks apply to crypto custody activity and should not be seen as the introduction of new rules or expectations.

The timing of the statement coincides with ‘Crypto Week' in the US House of Representatives, during which lawmakers are considering several pieces of legislation aimed at building a more defined regulatory structure for digital assets.

In June 2025, the US Senate approved the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill. Specifically, eighteen Democrats voted in favour, while two Republicans opposed the measure. The bill then proceeded to the House of Representatives for further consideration. 

A key provision of the GENIUS Act establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, an area of the cryptocurrency sector that has grown rapidly in recent years but remained largely unregulated. While there is broad consensus in Congress that oversight is needed, political disagreements have slowed progress.

Crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale has announced that it has confidentially submitted documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a potential US listing.

The decision overlaps with the start of the crypto week in the US, where regulators plan to debate three major bills that could provide long-awaited clarity to the crypto industry. Investors' present interest in the bills, which are anticipated to support the development of digital assets to potentially be further integrated into traditional finance, has sent bitcoin over USD 120,000 for the first time. According to specialists in the cryptocurrency sector, talking about the current US market, companies operating in this industry should seize the opportunity. 

Grayscale operates several crypto exchange-traded funds, including a spot Bitcoin ETF that offers investors exposure to bitcoin's price movement without owning any of the coin itself. The company delivers over 35 investment products and manages over USD 33 billion in assets, according to its data. By filing for the IPO confidentially, Grayscale can withhold details about its finances and provide terms until closer to the actual listing.

Grayscale's legal challenge against the SEC supported the approval of spot bitcoin in 2024. At that time, the regulator did not approve money managers who wished to issue these eight ether ETFs on the NYSE and Nasdaq. This decision was a preliminary step towards allowing the ETFs to trade. Also, the move came after the SEC approved ETFs that invested directly in bitcoin. The group looking for approval for ether ETFs included prominent Wall Street companies such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, as well as crypto-focused ones like Grayscale, Bitwise, and Hashdex. 

Furthermore, Grayscale's move follows stablecoin issuer Circle's listing from June 2025, with its shares reaching over sixfold from their USD 31 IPO price. Additionally, Gemini, a crypto exchange company, and Bullish, an exchange, have also recently filed to go public in the US.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The Trump administration has declared its intention to prohibit the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States. This decision is part of a comprehensive strategy outlined by the White House cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks, who has articulated three key positions: a firm rejection of a central bank digital currency, the protection of the right to self-custody digital assets, and opposition to excessive government intervention in the crypto industry.

According to lawmakers familiar with the matter, the proposal to ban CBDC issuance is unlikely to gain traction in the Senate. This stance is consistent with the administration's broader approach to digital assets, which includes supporting the crypto industry and safeguarding individual rights within the sector. The administration's emphasis on self-custody and resistance to government overreach indicates a commitment to decentralized financial systems and individual control over digital assets.

The announcement coincides with a period of significant volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as various proposals and legislative actions shape the future of digital assets in the U.S. The Trump administration's position on CBDCs mirrors a broader global debate within the financial community about the role of central banks in the digital era. While some nations are exploring the potential advantages of CBDCs, others are wary of the implications for financial stability and individual privacy.

The administration's stance on CBDCs is part of a broader initiative to integrate federal education and workforce systems, as evidenced by the collaboration between the Labor and Education departments. This effort aims to create a more unified approach to education and workforce development, which could have implications for the future of digital asset education and training.

The Trump administration's approach to digital assets is marked by a focus on individual rights and decentralized systems. By rejecting CBDCs and advocating for self-custody, the administration is positioning itself as a defender of individual control over digital assets. This position could have far-reaching implications for the future of the crypto industry in the U.S., as well as for the broader debate about the role of central banks in the digital age.

If you haven't heard of stablecoins yet — chances are you will soon.

There is perhaps no hotter segment in the cryptocurrency world at the moment than stablecoins. Companies like Amazon or Walmart are considering adopting them, while big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are exploring launching their own stablecoins, according to The Wall Street Journal.

What's more, Congress is on the verge of adopting legislation this week that would provide a formal framework for the sector, effectively making stablecoins part of U.S. regulations.

There's a reason behind the excitement. As a concept, stablecoins are pretty groundbreaking in the world of money.

A key vision behind stablecoins is that people and companies should be able to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous banks or money transfer companies, that take time and charge fees, getting in the way.

But as detractors point out, there are real risks to stablecoins. Unlike the money we know, stablecoins are still new and regulations are still evolving. The relatively recent set of rules and its ease of use have also attracted shady actors like drug dealers and ransomware hackers.

So what are stablecoins? Here are three things to know.

Unlike other types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have a secret weapon that are meant to make them far safer.

That's because as the name implies, each stablecoin is meant to be stable. This is how it works: If you buy a stablecoin that's worth $1, the issuer that provided you with that stablecoin has to keep $1 in reserve, so that when you want to cash it you can get paid back promptly. (Dollars are primarily used to back stablecoins, but euros or some other asset of value like gold can also be used).

NPR's Planet Money — and others — have perhaps the neatest analogy.

Stablecoins are like the chips you get in a casino. Say you pay the cashier $100 and you get $100 in chips to gamble. Once you are done, you return whatever chips you have gained — or have left — and get the corresponding amount from the casino.

The issuer should be able to pay you back, just like you trust the casino will have the money when you go to cash in your chips.

It's probably the reason why stablecoins today are mainly used to buy and trade other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, because of the ease with which they can be converted to cash.


                Stablecoins are used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which is currently trading at record highs.

The biggest company in this arena is Tether, which has a stablecoin called USDT and is based in El Salvador. The second is Circle, which issues a stablecoin called USDC.

Even President Trump is involved in stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, in which his family has financial interests, has issued one called USD1, meaning the president stands to benefit financially from the increased adoption of stablecoins (though as of now USD1 has a miniscule market share).

At the moment, the stablecoin market is worth just over $250 billion, but it's growing fast. Citigroup projects that the total amount of outstanding stablecoin could hit $1.6 to $3.7 trillion by 2030.

Congress is also on the verge of adopting legislation that would provide a formal framework for the sector, effectively making stablecoins part of U.S. regulations.

The GENIUS Act was passed by the Senate last month, and the House is expected to consider the legislation this week. (The acronym stands for ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin"".)

Among other aspects, the Act mandates that stablecoin issuers must hold proper one-to-one reserves and seeks to ensure that issuers are obeying anti-money laundering rules — though critics deride the measures as too weak.

The real excitement around stablecoins is that they provide a real-life advantage: They can make transferring money easier in a world where digital wallets and mobile payments are becoming more and more common.

In some developing countries, where dollars aren't easily accessible, companies with an international trading business are already starting to use stablecoin to expedite money transfers from their partners, transactions that usually take days or weeks through the traditional banking system.

With stablecoin, payments across companies can be transferred instantaneously at a fraction of the costs even if they are in different countries.

Such payments were estimated at a mere $6 billion in February, a very small sliver of the market — but those in the industry see its potential.

Yellow Card, a stablecoin payments company with offices in 16 African countries, says it facilitates these types of transactions. CEO Chris Maurice says stablecoins provide a ""bridge"" for companies to interact with the global economy.

""It doesn't matter what industry you're in, it doesn't matter if you're in financial services or you're in the business of selling shoes on the side of the road. Everybody has the same set of issues when it comes to payments, especially international payments,"" says Maurice.


                Stablecoins could make international transactions easier in emerging markets where dollars are not that easily accessible. In the picture, a man in Kampala, Uganda, reflects exchange rate changes on a board on Jan. 20, 2024.

And it's not just companies — there are potential advantages for regular folks too.

Big retailers such as Amazon are hoping to benefit from stablecoins because they would no longer have to pay billions of dollars in fees for credit card transactions.

Buying something on Amazon or Walmart may seem instantaneous. But retailers have to pay fees and completing an entire transaction with different credit card companies or banks can take days.

""What people don't know is the payments that we all make every day, day to day, and the payments that institutions make back and forth to each other sometimes takes as much as a week to fully settle out and costs a fair amount of money for a fairly simple transaction,"" says Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy Officer at crypto exchange Coinbase.

Stablecoins however can make that process faster.

""I think we're on the verge of a payment revolution in the United States,"" he adds.

There's a question that still lingers: Are stablecoins actually safe?

When you get a stablecoin, you are effectively trusting that the company selling it to you is actually holding the equivalent dollars in reserves.

Stablecoin companies bristle at the question, and they are adamant that they safeguard their customers' money by parking them in ultra-safe investments such as U.S. Treasury bills.

But the concerns linger. New York's attorney general investigated Tether and crypto exchange Bifinex, accusing the two companies of not maintaining proper one-to-one reserves. The companies denied that, but the case was settled in 2021 with a $18.5 million fine, with the two crypto firms agreeing to be more transparent about their reserves.


                Stablecoins, if adopted, could reduce the fees merchants such as Amazon must pay to credit cards.

John Reed Stark, a former top financial regulator who served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement, is a prominent critic of cryptocurrencies. He says it is a big leap of faith to believe that stablecoin companies are properly holding reserves backing the stablecoin.

""In most instances, we have no visibility to any stablecoins, no public audits, no examinations, no inspections — who knows what is really going on?,"" Reed Stark says.

He adds that even though it might seem more onerous, the current payment system has checks and balances in place via credit card companies or banks, which offer ""a critical beneficial role for all consumers.""

There's the other big concern about stablecoins: They are suspected of being used by all kinds of illicit actors like drug dealers and scammers who need a way to transfer money and access the cash without being detected by regulators or the police.

""Even though you can see every payment on the Internet, you don't necessarily know who it's from and who it's to,"" says Darrell Duffie at Stanford University, who teaches finance and management. And he adds, there are ways for people to ""mask"" their transactions to make them harder to detect.

Critics worry that stablecoins could even pose a threat to the financial system.

One of the biggest fears is that they will suffer the equivalent of a run on the bank, like Silicon Valley Bank which collapsed in 2023. A similar scenario could play out if customers rush en masse to cash in their stablecoins — and the issuers find themselves unable to pay back customers.

An event like that could have knock-on effects across the financial sector, just like the 2008 global financial crisis showed how trouble in one area of the financial system can quickly spread.

Stablecoin issuers are holding many of their customer reserves at traditional lenders, weaving in the banking system into the stablecoin sector. And stablecoin issuers also keep a huge chunk of their money in U.S. Treasury bills, which is a common practice across the sector.

So a run on the bank could force stablecoin companies to quickly draw in their reserves at traditional lenders and lead them to sell off their U.S. debt in a hurry, thus sparking intense volatility.

There's debate about how dire the threat would be, but that tension is still at the heart of the debate over stablecoins.

They have real-life potential — but they are a relatively new financial product, one that critics fear will open up all kinds of risks that may not be so apparent right now, leading to unintended consequences.

An earlier version of the story incorrectly said Circle was the biggest stablecoin issuer while Tether was the second biggest. In fact, it's the reverse: Tether issues the most and Circle the second-most.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Exclusive: Former Coinbase exec raises $12.5 million for Dakota, a stablecoin-powered neobank","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/15/dakota-coinbase-executive-series-a-coinfund-ryan-bozarth/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Crypto and banking are drawing ever closer. Big banks like JPMorgan and Citi are exploring digital asset integrations, and big crypto companies like Circle and Ripple are applying for bank charters. Dakota, a neobank cofounded by a former Coinbase executive, aims to combine both corners of finance—and investors are betting it'll succeed.

On Tuesday, the startup announced that it had raised $12.5 million in a Series A led by the crypto venture firm CoinFund. Other participants included 6th Man Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and Triton Ventures. (Triton is the venture arm of the crypto exchange Kraken). 





The raise was purely for equity, said Ryan Bozarth, cofounder and CEO of Dakota. He declined to specify his startup's valuation. “Dakota [was] one of the first companies I had seen in the Web3 payment space that had a significant share of non-crypto customers,” Alex Felix, chief investment officer at CoinFund, told Fortune.





The injection of capital into Dakota, which uses stablecoins to move money between itself and its customers, is the latest bet from VCs on a company involved in one of the buzziest sectors of crypto. Stablecoins are tokens pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, and proponents claim they can speed up cross-border payments and reduce transaction fees.





While stablecoins are more than a decade old, the asset class has taken center stage this past year after interest from large fintechs and regulatory progress on Capitol Hill. In February, Stripe acquired the stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion. And, in June, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that aims to regulate the tokens.




Bozarth is a veteran of Big Tech. He's worked at Sony, Square, and Airbnb. He's also a former Coinbase executive who managed the U.S. crypto exchange's custody arm, or portion of the business that holds large amounts of crypto on behalf of corporate clients.





In 2022, Bozarth left Coinbase to found Dakota. Just like the Dakotas, which were once on the frontier of the U.S.'s territorial acquisitions westward, his startup is on the frontier of what he calls “pioneering technology.”





His neobank functions much like any other bank. It has checking accounts and provides users, mainly businesses, yield on the money they've deposited. But instead of relying on decades-old financial technology, it uses stablecoins to move money between it and its many banking partners. (Dakota does not have its own bank charter but is regulated in the U.S. and Europe as a money services business, said Bozarth.)





Over the past year, it's processed about $1.6 billion in transaction volume and is on pace to record $4 billion by December, Bozarth said. Dakota has more than 500 businesses using its platform, the majority of which are outside the U.S., he added.





“For a lot of folks outside of the U.S., access to a kind of U.S.-style bank account, or U.S. dollar-denominated account, is an incredibly valuable feature in itself,” said Bozarth.

The price of bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, marked another significant milestone Monday following record-breaking highs last week as lawmakers debate three pieces of legislation that will shape the market, experts said.

“Bitcoin is moving up, silver is moving up, gold is moving up,” said Andrew Rocco, stock strategist at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Research. 

The rally on the digital currency, which hit the $120,000 mark for the first time Monday, comes during ""crypto week,"" Rocco said, when the House of Representatives is scheduled to debate legislation that could create a legal framework for crypto exchanges and issuers to operate in. On Friday, bitcoin broke $118,000 for the first time.  

“The Trump administration and politicians on both sides of the aisle are pushing for that regulatory clarity this week,” Rocco said, but critics of the proposed bills say they do little to protect consumer investors and give issuers too much freedom.

“These bills could sow the seeds of the next financial crisis because they are regulatory wolves in sheep's clothing,"" said Mark Hays, associate director for cryptocurrency and financial technology at Americans for Financial Reform, a progressive non-profit that advocates for stronger Wall Street regulations.

The House will weigh three crypto bills this week:

Locally, New York Attorney General Letitia James early this month urged congressional leaders to strengthen the GENIUS Act to regulate issuers of stablecoin, such as banks, to combat the anonymous use of the currency in criminal activity and transactions.

Here are three things to know about bitcoin's rally and crypto week:

One major factor behind the recent rally on bitcoin, Rocco said, is that investors and crypto businesses believe that the week's scheduled bill votes will bring regulatory clarity.

For years, many in the industry have complained that “one of the main things that's been holding them back is the lack of regulatory clarity,” Rocco said. Without regulation, it makes it harder for businesses in the market to know exactly what they can and cannot do.

Investors are also turning to bitcoin, he said, as a safe haven investment in the wake of Congress' approval of President Donald Trump's ""one big beautiful bill."" The bill is expected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

“These assets are betting on a weakening U.S. dollar,” Rocco said.

Additionally, bitcoin has been impacted by the growth of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, said Craig Rudes, partner at Long Island Block Chain, a technical consulting firm for blockchain technology. 

Bitcoin ETFs, which first began trading in 2024, are financial products that allow investors to invest in crypto without directly owning it or needing to create separate digital asset accounts. 

Rocco said it's likely that prices will slow down after passage of the bills, as growing crypto prices generally come about as a result anticipated favorable market conditions.

“There's been a lot of hype into this week,” he said.

The Clarity Act, which aims to demystify the roles that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission play in regulating digital currency markets, will have a major impact on crypto overall, Rocco said.

“These companies have been begging for this clarity,” he said. 

The GENIUS Act has the potential to massively grow the use and investment in stablecoins,"" Rocco said. ""Its passage could mean a stronger U.S. Treasury if a dollar-backed digital currency takes off."" 

The Senate voted in favor of the bill in June.

Rudes said the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency. As a result, he said, the bill protects investors from being mandated to use a government-run currency. 

“There shouldn't be a government entity controlling and mandating the use of a digital asset,"" Rudes said. 

As far as the legislation's impact on Long Island investors goes, Rudes said the passage of stablecoin regulations will usher in an age of cheaper transactions. 

“Stablecoin passing into law is going to change how we do business over the next year to two years,” he said. “No longer will we paying MasterCard and Visa these percentages on transactions.”

Hays with Americans for Financial Reform said the bills fail to protect consumers.

""They are passed as bills that provide consumer protection but what they do is create industry friendly regulatory carveouts,"" Hays said.

Under the proposed Clarity Act, Hays said crypto would be treated like commodities rather than securities, facing far less scrutiny and regulation. 

At the same time, he said, the GENIUS Act, in creating a framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, doesn't have the teeth to require things like insurance on deposits like a traditional bank.

“Instead of bank-like [regulations] they are bank-lite in that they give stablecoin issuers some of the same privileges of banks … but without the same obligations,"" Hays said.

Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor. 

Sean Craig

sean.craig@thedailyupside.com

Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, vaulted over $120,000 for the first time on Monday, the opening day of what Republicans in the House of Representatives have dubbed “Crypto Week.”

Lawmakers are poised to consider three major pieces of legislation that supporters say will “make America the crypto capital of the world.” Those in less sexy asset classes will have to dream of a future Fixed Income Friday on Capitol Hill.

Bitcoin, which is up roughly 30% this year and did pare its gains back below $120,000, was not alone, as other leading cryptocurrencies Ether, Solana and Chainlink advanced on Monday. The trio of bills before Congress — the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the Senate's GENIUS stablecoin package.

The CLARITY Act, if passed, would lay the groundwork for a regulatory framework for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Providing this kind of certainty would likely encourage traditional institutional investors like asset management firms, hedge funds, and banks — some of which have kept a cautious approach to crypto due to a lack of clarity around legal compliance — to grab their knees and plunge in. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing its own central bank digital currency – if passed, that would amount to lawmakers articulating a preference for market-driven innovation in the crypto space over state-led initiatives. 

Then there's arguably the most important bill that's fuelling the crypto rally: the GENIUS Act. This bill would establish a federal framework for stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that has a constant value, often via a 1:1 peg to the dollar. The bill would require them to be backed by liquid assets like dollars or Treasury bonds, and issuers would have to disclose their reserve holdings. Stablecoin use has grown considerably in recent months, and many believe they could be used for instant payments — Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, which would allow them to skip billions in traditional financial transaction fees. The optimism is already registering in crypto and traditional markets:

Strategic Antics: The GENIUS Act received bipartisan support in the Senate and is most likely to reach President Donald Trump's desk first. But many Democrats are opposed, as well as to the CLARITY Act, which critics have argued contains threadbare protections for consumers and against fraud. In other words, prepare for an engrossing series of hours-long CSPAN still-camera shots of debates over amendments.

The big US banks bested Q1 earnings expectations, and many observers expect big boosts to their Q2 trading desk revenues. 

The dollar is the most important currency on earth, adding up to 57.7% of global currency reserves in the first quarter. 

A planned 50% tariff on copper has left commodities markets roiling and analysts toiling with the idea consumers paying for higher prices. 

Even after TikTok is kicked off app stores later this year, the current app will keep working for US users until March. 

Thiel's bank, named after the mountain where the dragon Smaug hoards his treasure, plans to serve tech startups and crypto companies.  

The US debt is about the same as its entire economic output and is projected to grow if Trump's megabill passes. 

The current surge in energy demand is virtually unprecedented since the mass effort to electrify America immediately following World War II. 

The S&P 500's recent record high marked an encouraging sign that markets are no longer all that concerned with worst-case trade war scenarios. 

Ford said that its second quarter sales rocketed 14% in the second quarter from a year earlier to 612,095 vehicles. 

Experts have already warned that rollbacks to electric vehicle tax incentives will slow sales growth big time. 

In May, POTUS scrapped the “de minimis” exemption that allowed Shein and Temu to ship packages worth less than $800 to the US duty-free. 

Rising temperatures and massive new data centers are providing a massive stress test for the US power grid.

Here's the deal. Crypto payroll integration isn't just a passing trend; it's a full-blown revolution. With big names like Apple toying with blockchain solutions, the potential for decentralized payments in tech is starting to show its face, and it looks promising. Let's take a closer look at how this crypto payroll for startups scene is shaping up.

These days, it seems like everyone is jumping on the crypto payroll bandwagon, especially startups eager to harness the magic of blockchain tech. By using stablecoins—like USDC for freelancer invoicing—companies can ensure payments are quick and immune to the wild price swings that come with most cryptocurrencies. This isn't just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how businesses are getting their money where it needs to go.

And the creative sector? It's getting a serious makeover thanks to blockchain payments. More and more companies are waking up to the benefits of decentralized payroll tools, which not only speed up payment processes but also lighten the administrative load. With crypto payroll platforms, businesses can hire remote developers globally, tapping into talent without the usual geographical restrictions. This is especially useful in gaming and digital content creation, where timely payments keep the creative juices flowing.

Now, let's talk about the good stuff. Decentralized payroll solutions come with a bag full of perks that traditional systems can't match. 

First off, cost efficiency. Bye-bye, middlemen and those annoying transaction fees. Then there's the instant payments, which are, well, instant. No more waiting for the bank to open to get paid. And, of course, transparency and trust. With blockchain, every transaction is recorded, making it hard to pull a fast one.

These benefits are especially attractive as remote work becomes the new normal. Businesses are on the lookout for ways to make their operations smoother, and this seems like a solid option.

But hold up, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The road ahead has bumps. Regulatory fragmentation is a major pain point. Different countries have their own rules about using crypto, and companies need to stay on the right side of the law—especially in the gaming and metaverse spaces where things can get complicated.

Then there's the volatility factor. Cryptos can swing wildly, and not everyone wants to be paid in something that might tank overnight. Some businesses might just stick to stablecoins for payroll, which seems to be a safer bet.

As we peer into the crystal ball, it looks like crypto payroll in tech is here to stay. The perks of decentralized payroll solutions, paired with the growing acceptance of blockchain, suggest that crypto payments are set to become a mainstream option. By embracing these changes, companies could streamline their operations and attract the talent needed to thrive in a digital world.

Yeah, the evolution of crypto payroll integration isn't just about new payment methods. It's about rethinking what compensation looks like in the modern workforce. As more companies see the potential of blockchain payments, we may soon find ourselves in a world where crypto payroll isn't just an option—it's the norm.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","BlackRock's crypto inflows jump 370% in Q2 while net flows slump","https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-crypto-inflows-q2-total-flows-slump","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:38:45 GMT","

 BlackRock's Q2 inflows into crypto funds accounted for 16.5% of all the total ETF inflows, marking a massive increase from just 2.8% in Q1 2025. 

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $11.5 trillion in assets under management, reported a massive increase in cryptocurrency fund inflows in the second quarter of 2025.

According to BlackRock's quarterly earnings released on Tuesday, Q2 inflows into its crypto iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged 366% to $14 billion, up from $3 billion in the previous quarter.

The crypto inflows accounted for 16.5% of BlackRock's total Q2 ETF inflows of $85 million, marking notable growth from just below 3% in Q1 2025.

Still, BlackRock total inflows declined 19%, falling from $84 billion in Q1 to $68 billion in Q2.

The decline reflected the impact of a “single institutional client's $52 billion lower-fee index partial redemption,” BlackRock said.

As of June 30, digital assets generated $40 million in base fees, representing about 1% of BlackRock's long-term revenue. This figure reflects an 18% increase from $34 million in Q1.

“While digital assets account for just 1% of base fees, their rapid growth signals increasing revenue contribution potential,” BlackRock noted in the update.

“iShares ETFs had a record first half in flows, and technology ACV growth reached a fresh high of 16%,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said, adding:

BlackRock's rising crypto inflows in Q2 have not surprised investors, as many market observers repeatedly highlight major milestones in the crypto ETF market.

In early June, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), became the fastest ETF to ever hit the mark in only 341 days since launch last year, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

According to data from CoinShares, BlackRock's crypto ETF inflows accounted for 42% of total $184 billion inflows in crypto funds in the first half of 2025.

In a broader perspective, crypto funds saw significant bullish action in Q2 2025, seeing one of the longest inflow streaks on record since April. The positive sentiment came amid Bitcoin rising 25% in Q2, compared to a 12% decline in the first quarter of the year, according to CoinGecko.

 Citizenship and residency via crypto are now possible in countries like Vanuatu, El Salvador and Portugal, with investment requirements ranging from $100,000 to $1 million. 

Vanuatu is one of the fastest countries to offer citizenship, with crypto accepted through licensed agents.

Dominica and Saint Lucia offer Caribbean citizenship in months using crypto converted via trusted agencies.

Portugal offers EU residency and a path to citizenship through crypto-linked investment funds.

El Salvador offers direct citizenship through a $1-million Bitcoin or USDT investment, with no fiat needed.

Crypto and globality are a strong mind-map pair In 2025. It might not be that much of a surprise, then, that both citizenship-by-investment crypto programs and golden visas with crypto are appearing to meet the needs of investors holding Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and stablecoins. What was once a fiat-only world now includes pathways tailored for those living a crypto-rich lifestyle.

Most governments still require fiat contributions for these programs, but a growing number of licensed migration agents now accept crypto, converting it into local currency before submitting it to authorities. 

A handful of jurisdictions go further, offering opportunities ranging from fast-track second passports to long-term residency for investors. 

This article explores four crypto-friendly countries for citizenship or residency, covering both direct and indirect crypto payment models, as of July 2025.

Vanuatu offers one of the fastest second passport routes in the world, with citizenship typically granted within 30-60 days. The required donation starts at $130,000 for single applicants and scales to $180,000 for a family of four.

While the government itself does not accept direct crypto, licensed agents are permitted to receive Bitcoin or stablecoins, convert them to fiat and handle the full application process.

This allows crypto holders to use their assets both to demonstrate wealth and to fund the donation, provided that standard Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols are met.

Some agents even advertise the ability to pay via Bitcoin for the total investment cost, typically between $115,000 and $130,000, streamlining access for crypto passport seekers.

100% remote process — no residency or in-person interviews required

No language, education or stay requirements

Dual citizenship is allowed

Tax-free on personal income, capital gains, wealth and inheritance

Visa-free travel to 90+ countries, though Schengen access is currently under review

Family inclusion: spouses, dependent children (under 25) and parents (over 50).

This is one of the few citizenship-by-investment crypto options offering true speed and discretion, appealing to digital nomads and crypto founders seeking security and mobility.

Did you know? Vanuatu is one of the few countries in the world without a military — citizens enjoy global neutrality and low geopolitical risk.

Dominica: $200,000+ donation to the Economic Diversification Fund

Saint Lucia: $240,000+ donation or $300,000+ in approved real estate.

Both countries offer fast-track second passports, processed in four to nine months, with remote application procedures and no physical presence required.

Licensed agencies (such as Apex Capital Partners, Global Residence Index and Citizenship Bay) accept Bitcoin, Tether's USDt (USDT) and other major assets. These are converted into fiat on behalf of applicants to meet official requirements.

Applicants can manage the process end-to-end using crypto, working with agents to handle everything from proof of funds to submission and approval — ideal for those researching how to move abroad with crypto or seeking a passport with Bitcoin.

Efficient processing times (under a year)

Strong passports: visa-free or visa-on-arrival to the EU, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong and more

Entire families can be included (spouse, children and, in many cases, parents)

No physical presence, language test or residency obligations.

In-depth due diligence checks by both government and third-party firms

Some countries scrutinize Caribbean CBI passports more closely due to reputation concerns.

For those seeking residency by investment via crypto or looking to buy citizenship with crypto in a stable jurisdiction, these Caribbean options remain attractive.

Did you know? Dominica runs the longest continuously active citizenship-by-investment program in the world, launched in 1993.

Portugal remains a top destination for those seeking residency by investment using crypto-funded wealth. 

Since 2023, the focus of the Golden Visa program has shifted from real estate to regulated investment funds, scientific research and company formation. The typical qualifying investment is 500,000 euros, usually placed in a Portuguese CMVM-regulated fund. 

Residency can lead to citizenship after five years, though a proposed extension to 10 years is under legislative review as of July 2025.

Applicants must spend only seven days in the first year and 14 days every two years, making it suitable for crypto nomads and long-term investors.

While Portugal does not accept direct crypto for golden visa investments, several qualified funds now offer exposure to blockchain-related assets:

Bitcoin venture funds focused on Portuguese blockchain startups

The Golden Crypto Fund, mixing fixed income with up to 35% in BTC and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

Custom “3 BTC investment” offers, pegged to meet the 500,000-euro threshold.

All structures are visa-approved, though they operate through fiat conversions via licensed intermediaries — ideal for those asking how to get a golden visa with Bitcoin or gain access to crypto-friendly governments.

No language test or full-time residency requirements

Full EU residency rights and citizenship path (pending legislative updates)

Favorable crypto tax environment: Long-term crypto gains are tax-exempt for individuals

Family inclusion (spouse, dependent children and sometimes parents).

The only downsides are a relatively high entry cost and application backlogs, with some delays exceeding 12 months.

Portugal remains one of the top crypto passport countries in the EU, with strong governance and a deep talent base in blockchain innovation.

Did you know? Portugal has a law that grants automatic citizenship to third-generation descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled in the 15th century.

Launched in December 2023 in partnership with Tether, El Salvador's Freedom Visa is the world's first fully crypto-native migration program. It offers both residency and an expedited path to citizenship in return for a $1-million investment in Bitcoin or USDt. The program is capped at 1,000 investors annually, aligning with the country's broader Bitcoin adoption strategy.

The program is designed for direct crypto payment:

Applicants submit an initial $999 in BTC or USDT as a non-refundable application deposit.

Upon approval, they invest the remaining $999,001 in approved initiatives.

Tether handles the crypto-to-fiat infrastructure, enabling the government to directly receive investments in digital assets.

El Salvador remains a global leader among countries accepting crypto for residency.

Fast-track timeline of around six weeks to initial approval, then citizenship within months

Applies to entire families: spouses, children and often extended relatives

No physical stay requirement: a true passport with Bitcoin experience

Citizenship granted via accelerated naturalization (not instant but rapid)

Investments support national development, including education, tech and infrastructure.

This program is a unique offer for those looking to buy citizenship with crypto directly, bypassing fiat intermediaries entirely.

Did you know? El Salvador was the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, and its president, Nayib Bukele, holds office while also managing a national Bitcoin treasury.

Comparison of crypto migration programs (2025)

As learned, several countries now offer residency or citizenship in exchange for crypto-funded investments, from fast-track citizenship in Vanuatu and El Salvador to long-term residency paths in Portugal and Kazakhstan. Investment thresholds range from $100,000 to $1 million, with varying timelines and crypto acceptance methods.

Here is a quick summary of the crypto migration programs offered by these companies:

In May 2025, Kazakhstan introduced a 10-year renewable residency permit, becoming Central Asia's first country to offer an official visa-by-investment route. While it does not grant immediate citizenship, it provides a long-term legal base for global investors looking to participate in an emerging frontier market.

The required investment is $300,000, placed either in the equity of a local company or in publicly traded Kazakh securities.

Kazakhstan has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly government. The Ministry of Digital Development is pushing for a national crypto reserve and licensing crypto banks, and the country runs active regulatory sandboxes.

However, no direct crypto payments are currently accepted under the golden visa. Investors must convert their crypto assets into fiat before applying. In time, licensed intermediaries may allow smoother BTC/USDT conversions aligned with visa requirements.

One of the most affordable long-term residency programs at $300,000

Family members (spouse and dependents) included under one visa

Tax incentives, such as a flat 10% income tax and potential foreign income exemptions

Strategic geographic position between Europe and Asia.

However, there's no automatic citizenship, and applicants must reside for at least five years, speak Kazakh or Russian and renounce previous citizenships.

Kazakhstan is emerging as a viable base for crypto relocation, even as its visa process remains fiat-only in 2025.

Did you know? Kazakhstan is home to the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), a separate legal zone with its own crypto-friendly framework based on English common law.

In a significant move for crypto investors seeking second passports, St. Kitts & Nevis has begun accepting cryptocurrency holdings as partial proof of funds under its citizenship-by-investment (CBI) program. While crypto cannot be used directly to make the investment, it may now count toward demonstrating the applicant's overall net worth.

Starting in March 2025, the country's Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU) updated its application rules to allow digital assets, such as BTC or ETH, to serve as part of an applicant's wealth declaration. This marks an important step toward integrating crypto into global migration and investment frameworks.

Please note that applications involving crypto may be subject to additional due diligence fees and extended background checks to ensure compliance with AML regulations. Applicants must submit full documentation, including:

Proof of ownership of the crypto assets

Transaction history to establish origin of funds

Valuation reports at the time of submission.

Crypto investors can also include family members, such as a spouse, children and dependent parents, under a single citizenship application, provided standard vetting criteria are met.

For crypto investors pursuing global mobility, several practical factors should guide your planning.

Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable. Regardless of the destination, you'll need to go through KYC/AML procedures, verify the source of funds and often convert crypto to fiat via licensed agents or law firms. This process ensures legality and transparency across all crypto migration programs.

Due diligence requirements can be stringent — especially in Caribbean CBI schemes, where multi-layered background checks and ongoing compliance monitoring are standard. These processes may affect your timeline and eligibility, particularly if your crypto activity lacks clear documentation.

Policy shifts are another key consideration. For instance, Portugal's pending legislation could extend the naturalization timeline from five to 10 years, directly impacting those targeting EU citizenship through crypto-linked investments. Always account for possible changes in residency by investment crypto paths.

Lastly, working with professionals familiar with crypto relocation tips, including tax planning and legal structuring, is essential. Migration lawyers versed in digital assets and international compliance can help avoid costly missteps.

Across the four programs profiled — El Salvador's crypto-first citizenship, Portugal's fund-based EU residency and three flexible CBI options in Vanuatu, Dominica and St. Lucia — you have a spectrum of options that match different timelines, family needs and crypto liquidity preferences.

 Ripple told Cointelegraph it will apply for a MiCA license to expand its crypto and stablecoin operations across the European Economic Area. 

Payment solution company Ripple has confirmed its intention to pursue a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license to expand into the EU.

In messages sent to Cointelegraph, a Ripple spokesperson said the company intends “to become MiCA-compliant” as it recognizes “significant opportunity in the European market.”

The statement follows Ripple's registration of Ripple Payments Europe S.A. in Luxembourg in late April.

On Tuesday, industry media outlet Ledger Insights reported that the company had applied for an electronic money institution license in Luxembourg. Ripple refused to confirm or deny the report, saying only that the firm does not “have any updates to provide currently.”

Luxembourg is emerging as a hub for crypto firms seeking MiCA compliance. In late June, major US-based publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase secured its MiCA license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier and named the region as its EU headquarters.

In mid-May, crypto exchange Bitstamp also announced that it obtained a crypto asset service provider license under MiCA from Luxembourg regulators. A similar license is held by Clearstream Banking, an institution involved in the European Central Bank's digital euro trials.

Another example is Standard Chartered, one of the world's largest banks, which launched its cryptocurrency services in Europe after obtaining a digital asset license in Luxembourg in early January. 

Still, Luxembourg authorities do not appear to view the crypto sector in a particularly lenient way. In late May, Luxembourg classified virtual asset service providers as high-risk entities for money laundering in a national review, highlighting concerns over the crypto industry's exposure to financial crime.

 Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner Katie Stockton says Bitcoin should reach $135,000 as an “intermediate-term objective.” 

Bitcoin price predictions are coming thick and fast after Monday's all-time high, and one analyst is tipping Bitcoin to reach $135,000 before a significant market correction.

Before this breakout, there were almost two months of consolidation, which now feels like “ancient history,” Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner Katie Stockton told CNBC on Monday.

She said that the firm creates “measured move projections” from the breakouts and assuming the previous uptrend continues ahead of any corrective phase:

Stockton said stocks that track Bitcoin (BTC) markets, such as Coinbase or Strategy, are also likely to perform well. “There is positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies,” she said, citing Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) movements. 

Bitcoin broke out from its multi-week sideways channel on Monday to reach an all-time high of $122,871 on Coinbase before retreating back below $120,000 during early trading on Tuesday morning. 

Stockton's prediction closely mirrors other analysts' recent forecasts. 

“Based on the July 10 breakout signal, which has historically led to an average 20% rally over the following two months, we project Bitcoin could reach $133,000,” 10x Research head of research Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph on Tuesday. 

“Investors are still looking at $150,000 as the next major price level to reach during this cycle,” LVRG Research director Nick Ruck told Cointelegraph, adding: 

Related: Bitcoin is rallying on US deficit concerns, not hype: Analyst

Cointelegraph technical analysts tagged $132,000 to $138,000 as a “reasonable short-term target” before momentum slows.

Bitcoin's breakout of what appears to be a “bull flag” pattern hints at a $130,000 target, analysis suggested.  

Bitcoin smashed past the $120,000, breaking above a seven-year trendline that has acted as a strong resistance level since 2018. 

“This is an incredibly bullish signal, especially given the environment this is happening in,” Nic Puckrin, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note shared with Cointelegraph. 

“But, most importantly, retail buyers are nowhere to be seen yet. This rally is still driven by institutional capital, while the typical signs of retail involvement — soaring search traffic and crypto app rankings — are absent,” he added before stating that retail is unlikely to get involved “until we get to around $150,000 and the FOMO kicks in.”

The big move increased Bitcoin's market capitalization to $2.4 trillion, which enabled BTC to flip Amazon and become the world's fifth-largest global asset.

However, in terms of asset classes such as gold, equities, real estate and bonds, it is still a minnow, Bitcoin Opportunity Fund co-founder James Lavish observed on Monday.

We've Dammed So Much Water, Earth's Poles Have Shifted

When large masses of water are moved from one place to another, this changes the shape of Earth and leads to a phenomenon called true polar wander

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Over the past 200 years, humans have stored hundreds of billions of liters of water in thousands of dams around the world. That corralling of water is pushing Earth's geographic poles away from its axis of rotation, a new study published in Geophysical Research Letters has found, contributing to a phenomenon called true polar wander.

In an ideal model of our planet, the axis around which Earth rotates goes through the fixed geographic poles, or what we typically call the North and South Poles. But in reality, the axis pierces through the surface of the planet at points some distance away from the geographic poles, says Jim Davis, a geodesist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. The distance between the two is called the polar motion, or true polar wander, and it's crucial to know for a number of purposes.

“Astronomers need it. GPS depends on it. There's a lot of things that depend on knowing how the Earth is rotating at the moment,” Davis says. “We have to know the polar motion accurately or else the errors will propagate into other systems on which we depend on a daily basis.”

True polar wander happens because the surface of Earth rotates to redistribute mass and stabilize its spin. Imagine our planet as a beach ball spinning on someone's finger. If someone stuck a wad of gum on the ball, the ball might wobble on its axis of rotation and move to adjust to the increase in mass, Davis explains. On Earth, instead of a wad of gum, there are shifting ice sheets and movements of mantle rock that cause the planet to adjust itself. Though dams move a smaller amount of mass than these other phenomena, they still have an appreciable effect.

To figure out the size of the effect, Natasha Valencic, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Harvard University, and her team made a few minor additions to a previously developed dam database and reviewed a total of 6,862 dams constructed from 1835 to 2011. They then calculated the dams' effect on the Earth's poles in two time periods. From 1835 to about 1950, most dams were constructed in North America and Europe, causing the North Pole to shift away from these regions. Then, starting in the 1950s, more dams were constructed in East Africa and Asia, pulling the pole in the other direction. By 2011, the pole was only 20.5 centimeters away from its original location, but over time, it had moved back and forth over a total of 113.4 cm, a little more than a meter.

“A meter is pretty big in regards to polar motion,” Davis says. Studying polar motion reveals something about how Earth's mass is moving, he says. “The mass motions reveal both important natural processes in the Earth system, as well as significant human-induced changes, so understanding them is important for science and society, including climate change and solutions to climate change.”

Where Did Bird Flu Go?

Bird flu was nearly everywhere in the U.S.—in chickens, cows, pet cats and even humans. Cases have gone down, but experts warn that it hasn't disappeared

For months, bird flu was seemingly everywhere in the U.S.: news headlines reported the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus was rapidly sweeping through hundreds of herds of dairy cattle and leading to massive culls of poultry flocks, concerning infections in humans and grocery store aisles where nary an egg could be found.

But nearly as quickly as bird flu took hold in daily conversations, it disappeared from them and most people's thoughts—making it easy for the public to think avian influenza's threat had waned. Far from it, experts say. “The flu is still there, and we just don't know enough about it,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.

What made the virus apparently fade away—and what does that mean for the future of bird flu?

One scenario experts have definitively ruled out is that the currently circulating bird flu virus—a member of a subtype of influenza called H5N1 for the proteins on its surface—is simply vanishing on its own, says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown University. “There has been this wishful thinking that it's just going to wipe through and be gone, and we've just not seen that, and that's just not how flu viruses work,” Nuzzo says. “This isn't going away.”

Experts are still monitoring for H5N1 avian influenza in a variety of animals: wild birds, commercial poultry animals, wild mammals, dairy cattle and humans—and finding it, albeit at lower rates. But the virus is tricky, behaving somewhat differently in each host. Here's what we know about the current state of the virus.

The most reliable data on bird flu prevalence come from poultry operations. That's because the virus is so devastating in chickens and turkeys that farmers must cull flocks as soon as they detect an infection to reduce spread. They are also able to report outbreaks to the federal government to receive partial compensation. There's no way to ignore a sick flock or any incentive to hide one.

And right now poultry tolls to avian influenza are relatively low. Farmers reported just three million poultry birds killed by the virus or culled to stop it in March and April combined compared with 23 million and 12 million in January and February, respectively. May saw more than five million birds dead after the virus infiltrated several massive egg-laying facilities in Maricopa County, Arizona. But June rates fell far below one million birds, and July cases to date remain very low, with just one commercial facility affected so far.

These lower rates of bird flu aren't particularly surprising, given the virus's past behavior in poultry to date, says Mike Persia, a poultry specialist at Virginia Tech. “We generally see a reduction in infections over the summer,” he says. Since the current outbreak began in early 2022, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show that, each year, the monthly count of affected poultry birds has tended to dip to under five million in June, July and August.

Two factors seem to contribute to the apparent seasonal trend, Persia says. The virus appears to falter in higher ambient temperatures, and the migratory wild birds that typically introduce the virus into poultry flocks aren't traveling as widely now that breeding season is in full swing.

But the outbreak's history tells a cautionary tale: each autumn, the number of affected poultry birds rises again—so it would be premature to assume H5N1 is done with us. “I'm optimistic that maybe this was the last of it, and it goes away forever. I wouldn't take the lull as proof of that, though,” says Jada Thompson, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. “We need to maintain vigilance.”

Evaluating the outbreak in U.S. dairy cattle has been more difficult. Cows that are sick with bird flu eat less and produce thick and discolored milk. But the infection isn't nearly as fatal in cattle as it is in poultry, making the virus harder to see in the former. And there's no recompense for lost milk to encourage farmers to report being hit.

In addition, the virus's jump into dairy cattle in late 2023 was wildly unexpected and not publicly confirmed until March 2024, giving dairy farmers and virologists little time to understand bird flu's tendencies in the species. Last year cases continued throughout the summer, particularly in the hard-hit state of Colorado. Spread proved to be difficult to contain, in part because of the movement of animals required by the dairy industry. And although the virus can be monitored through milk, officials only began mandating such testing last December, after a full year of viral circulation.

This year reported infections have trailed off, with only two herds confirmed to have the virus in all of June. But it's unclear how to interpret the trend—dairy farmers, too, are left poised between caution and optimism.

Egg prices have fallen in recent months after reaching record highs earlier this year.

Throughout the outbreak, bird flu risk to humans has been low, although dairy and poultry workers with exposure to infected animals have been more vulnerable. The first detected human infection in 2024 came shortly after confirmation that dairy cattle had become sick with H5N1. Additional human cases came in flurries throughout the intervening months, totaling 70 confirmed infections, including one death, by mid-February. Since then, infection tallies at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stalled.

Experts doubt that's a good thing. “I can't rule out that part of why we're not finding infections is: we're just simply not looking for them,” Nuzzo says.

Throughout the outbreak, the CDC has kept a running tally of the testing it is conducting, and those numbers paint a clear picture. As of July 1, the CDC noted that more than 880 people had been subject to targeted testing after exposure to infected animals. On March 1 that number had been more than 840; in contrast, the February 1 number was more than 660. The CDC tested more than four times as many people in February as in March, April, May and June combined. Another way experts have kept tabs on bird flu has been through existing national flu surveillance—but because normal flu infections are in a seasonal lull, so are tests through that network.

The result is a lot of question marks. “We are in sort of a perfect storm of no testing,” Rasmussen says.

Even wastewater monitoring, which has proven helpful in understanding levels of the virus that causes COVID as testing rates have fallen, is of limited help. The approach looks for the presence of viruses in community water processing plants, but H5N1 is spread so broadly across species that it is nearly impossible to use these detections to definitively trace sources.

“No news in my world is not good news.” —Angela Rasmussen, virologist, University of Saskatchewan

“You don't know how it got there,” Nuzzo says of the virus in wastewater. “You don't know if people are infected; you don't know if [the virus is present] because birds were hanging out in the wastewater.” In some cases, spikes in wastewater levels of H5N1 have even been linked to farmers dumping milk from their infected cows.

Nuzzo suspects that there have certainly been more human cases of avian influenza than the 70 confirmed to date but that the virus is not spreading widely. “I don't think there's some huge iceberg of infections that we're missing,” Nuzzo says.

Nuzzo and Rasmussen find that cold comfort, however. Instead they emphasize how vital it is to have as much intel as possible about what H5N1 is doing. Choosing not to seek out evidence of the virus's behavior means passing up on the opportunity to catch any early signs of a pandemic in the making.

“No news in my world is not good news,” Rasmussen says. “We're just not collecting any data, and those are two very, very different things.”

The U.S.'s current approach is simply further shrouding a situation that is already difficult to parse—given the complexity of a multispecies outbreak and the unpredictable nature of rapidly changing influenza viruses.

“This is the kind of thing that could become a pandemic tomorrow, [or] it could never become a pandemic. And I don't know which one is going to happen,” Rasmussen says.

“This is a huge risk, but it's also a risk that may never come to pass,” she says. “But we won't know if we just stop looking for it.”

Doctors Discover a Woman With Her Own Unique Blood Type

Newly discovered “Gwada-negative” is the rarest of 48 known blood groups

By Martin L. Olsson, Jill Storry & The Conversation US

The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.

In a routine blood test that turned extraordinary, French scientists have identified the world's newest and rarest blood group. The sole known carrier is a woman from Guadeloupe whose blood is so unique that doctors couldn't find a single compatible donor.

The discovery of the 48th recognised blood group, called “Gwada-negative”, began when the woman's blood plasma reacted against every potential donor sample tested, including those from her own siblings. Consequently, it was impossible to find a suitable blood donor for her.

Many people know their blood type – A, B, AB or O – along with whether they are Rh-positive or negative. But these familiar categories (those letters plus “positive” or “negative”) represent just two of several dozens of blood group systems that determine compatibility for transfusions. Each system reflects subtle but crucial differences in the proteins and sugars coating our red blood cells.

To solve the mystery of the Guadeloupian woman's incompatible blood, scientists turned to cutting-edge genetic analysis. Using whole exome sequencing – a technique that examines all 20,000-plus human genes – they discovered a mutation in a gene called PIGZ.

This gene produces an enzyme responsible for adding a specific sugar to an important molecule on cell membranes. The missing sugar changes the structure of a molecule on the surface of red blood cells. This change creates a new antigen – a key feature that defines a blood group – resulting in an entirely new classification: Gwada-positive (having the antigen) or -negative (lacking it).

Using gene editing technology, the team confirmed their discovery by recreating the mutation in a lab. So red blood cells from all blood donors tested are Gwada-positive and the Guadeloupean patient is the only known Gwada-negative person on the planet.

The implications of the discovery extend beyond blood transfusions. The patient suffers from mild intellectual disability, and tragically, she lost two babies at birth – outcomes that may be connected to her rare genetic mutation.

The enzyme produced by the PIGZ gene operates at the final stage of building a complex molecule called GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol). Previous research has shown that people with defects in other enzymes needed for GPI assembly can experience neurological problems ranging from developmental delays to seizures. Stillbirths are also common among women with these inherited disorders.

Although the Caribbean patient is the only person in the world so far with this rare blood type, neurological conditions including developmental delay, intellectual disability and seizures have been noted in other people with defects in enzymes needed earlier in the GPI assembly line.

The Gwada discovery highlights both the marvels and challenges of human genetic diversity. Blood groups evolved partly as protection against infectious diseases (many bacteria, viruses and parasites use blood group molecules as entry points into cells). This means your blood type can influence your susceptibility to certain diseases.

But extreme rarity creates medical dilemmas. The French researchers acknowledge they cannot predict what would happen if Gwada-incompatible blood were transfused into the Guadeloupian woman. Even if other Gwada-negative people exist, they would be extremely difficult to locate. It is also unclear if they can become blood donors.

This reality points towards a futuristic solution: lab-grown blood cells. Scientists are already working on growing red blood cells from stem cells that could be genetically modified to match ultra-rare blood types. In the case of Gwada, researchers could artificially create Gwada-negative red blood cells by mutating the PIGZ gene.

Gwada joins 47 other blood group systems recognised by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. Like most of these blood-group systems, it was discovered in a hospital lab where technicians were trying to find compatible blood for a patient.

The name reflects the case's Caribbean roots: Gwada is slang for someone from Guadeloupe, giving this blood group both scientific relevance and cultural resonance.

As genetic sequencing becomes more advanced and widely used, researchers expect to uncover more rare blood types. Each discovery expands our understanding of human variation and raises fresh challenges for transfusion and other types of personalised medicine.

Despite their ominous name and oversized jaws, these animals only measure about one to three millimeters in length.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In Aristotle's De historia animalium (one of the founding texts of zoology), the great Greek thinker pens the very first description of a strange creature that is “found in books” and “look[s] like scorpions; they have no tails, and are very small.” This is a humble pseudoscorpion—a pint-sized false scorpion (as its name suggests) that nonetheless looks a lot like it's more-dangerous, bigger cousin. 

While a member of the class Arachnida, they shouldn't inspire as much fear as other poisonous members of this group. These creatures use poison to subdue prey, but pose no danger to humans, and can actually be immensely beneficial for pest control—they'll munch on moth larvae, mites, and small flies. And true to Aristotle's original observation, they can often be found within the pages of books, as one of their favorite prey species (booklice) feasts on the starch typically found in bookbindings. This explains their nickname: “book scorpions.”

But not all pseudoscorpions call literary habitats their home. A new study—published in the journal PLOS One and led by scientists at Jeonbuk National University—details four new species of “dragon pseudoscorpions,” named as such because of their dragon-like jaws. Far from the cozy confines of a bookshelf, the scientists found these miniscule critters (stretching only between one and three millimeters) in a cave system during a field study. They examined the species using genetics, ecology, and morphology and determined that they had found four new species in total: Spelaeochthonius dugigulensis, S. geumgulensis, S. magwihalmigulensis and S. yamigulensis

“In Korea, pseudoscorpions are a ‘neglected' invertebrate taxon with presently 28 species in 13 genera that belong to eight families,” the authors wrote. “However, a recent preliminary barcoding study has indicated that the species biodiversity in surface habitats must be significantly higher. The subterranean fauna is probably also diverse, but to date, only five pseudoscorpion species have been recorded from caves in South Korea.” 

This new discovery nearly doubles that number. 

Because these creatures live in caves, they have numerous adaptations that are considered “troglomorphic,” due to living in constant darkness. For example, these four new species lack eyes and possess very little body pigmentation, causing them to range from light orange to brown. The pseudoscorpions also possess massive jaws (in relation to their body size), which likely comes in handy when searching for food in complete darkness. 

The researchers theorize that these species are likely endemic to one single cave or karst system, but South Korea is chock-full of caves, with an estimated 2,000 spread across the Taebaek and Sobaek mountain ranges. 

“Many people have believed there is only one species (Spelaeochthonius dentifier) distributed in Korea,” Kyung-Hoon Jeong, a master student and lead author of the study from Jeonbuk National University, told IFLScience. “However, our result was totally different. Each species in the cave has big differences, both in morphology and genetically.”

Like all ecosystems on the planet, caves are threatened by climate change, and understanding the wide variety of animal life in these caves can help scientists conserve them. In order to save a species, it helps to know where to look—and sometimes you won't find the answer in the pages of a good book.

The megalithic tombs, located in Poland, are likely around 5,500 years old.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The new discovery of uniquely shaped “Polish pyramids” from 5,500 years ago highlights the distinct way early European agricultural societies buried their dead.

Discovered by a team from Adam Mickiewicz University using advanced remote sensing technology during routine field work, the team uncovered “mysterious ground embankments” before confirming them as long earthen tombs constructed during the Funnelbeaker culture of the Neolithic age, according to a translated statement from the Landscape Parks Complex of the Wielkopolska Voivodeship. To locate the tombs after the initial discovery, archaeologists employed aerial laser scanning followed by on-the-ground excavation.

Known as Polish pyramids—or “beds of giants”—the tombs located at the General Dezydery Chlapowski Landscape Park form an elongated trapezoid, with some stretching as long as 656 feet. This particular style of construction has the east end wider and taller than the west, creating a triangle shape or tail-like design from the tomb. Experts believe the use of the trapezoid shape is tied to the style of houses once used by nearby Neolithic cultures, according to the Polish Press Agency.

While the tombs rarely reach taller than 13 feet, the sheer size and design make them a distinct sight in Poland. The most recent find is only the second in the region, while more are known in northwestern Poland. Each tomb was typically covered with cobblestones and massive boulders were placed in front, some weighing as much as 10 tons, a show of the culture's intricate teamwork and tool know-how to make happen.

“The largest boulders that formed the entrance of the tomb are missing,” said Artur Golis, chief specialist for nature and landscape protection from the park, according to the Polish Press Agency. He believes the stones were chipped away over the centuries for use by the residents in other projects.

While fields of the Polish pyramids typically offered a communal location for the region's burials, only the most prominent folks within the society would get buried within the tombs. Each oversized tomb often only contained a single skeleton of a key leader, with the body placed in an upright position and surrounded by grave gifts. The tops of the pyramids were then covered with stones.

“Each generation built its own megalith, honoring the deceased who played a vital role in their community,” said Golis.

While no such skeletons were found in the most recent tomb discovery, archaeologists remain hopeful they can locate grave goods still buried nearby, most likely axes and pottery.

“These artifacts,” Golis said, “could provide further insight into the spiritual and daily lives of the Funnelbeaker people.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Japan Just Smashed the Internet Speed Record to Absolute Bits","https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a65402254/japan-internet-speed-record/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 13:45:00 GMT","

You thought your gigabit service was good? Try 1.2 petabits.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Japan doesn't typically do things at half speed. After all, this is a country whose post-war growth was termed the “economic miracle,” and it's also the first country to deliver high-speed train service, known as the shinkansen. So it's no wonder that the world-record-holder for fastest internet now resides in the nation. 

If you're were born in the 20th century (and maybe even a little after), you've witnessed first-hand the rapid increases in internet speeds. Dial-up internet, for example, delivered only 56 kilobits per second. Now, median internet speeds in the U.S. are around 242.38 megabits, with gigabit speeds becoming more readily available in cities. However, optical-based internet speeds haven't reach an upper limit yet—in fact, researchers around the world are regularly pushing internet speeds higher and higher.

In 2024, scientists at Aston University in the U.K successfully achieved 402 terabits per second internet speed, which is roughly 1.6 million times faster than typical home broadband. Now, a new team of scientists led by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) in Japan have absolutely shattered that record by achieving a transmit speed of 1.02 petabits of data—about 4 million times faster than home internet—over a distance over 1,800 kilometers. NICT previously achieved even faster speeds (1.7 petabits) but only transmitted over 63 kilometers. 

As Live Science notes, at 1.02 petabyte speeds, you could download the entirety of the Internet Archive—a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving every corner of the internet—in just four minutes or so. The results of the study were presented at the 48th Optical Fiber Communications Conference in San Francisco earlier this year.

While this is an optical transmission system—similar to optical internet systems used for home internet—this experimental version pushes the design of these cables to the limit. The team created a 19-core optical fiber, but with a common cladding to multiply transmission rate. During the experiment, NICT scientists and their international collaborators ran the signal through an 86.1-kilometer cable (along with amplifiers that boosted the signal before entering the cable). Then, the signal traveled 21 times through a recirculating loop, which accounts for the 1,802 kilometer distance. 

While an impressive achievement, you might ask who really needs 1.02 petabytes of internet speed. Well, as the authors note in a press release detailing the breakthrough, “the volume of data traffic is expected to increase explosively due to new communication services, and the realization of advanced information and communication infrastructure is required.” 

As our world becomes ever more connected—whether that looks like the Internet of Things, the smart grid, AI, or high-tech inventions we haven't even imagined yet—it will need a robust internet system that can ferry information around the globe in record time. 

Luckily for us, Japan is on the case.

Intermittent energy restriction, time-restricted eating and continuous energy restriction can all improve blood sugar levels and body weight in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, California.

""This study is the first to compare the effects of three different dietary interventions intermittent energy restriction (IER), time-restricted eating (TRE) and continuous energy restriction (CER) in managing type 2 diabetes with obesity,"" said Haohao Zhang, Ph.D., chief physician at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China.

Although researchers identified improved HbA1c levels, and adverse events were similar across the three groups, the IER group showed greater advantages in reducing fasting blood glucose, improving insulin sensitivity, lowering triglycerides, and strengthening adherence to the dietary interventions.

""The research fills a gap in directly comparing 5:2 intermittent energy restriction with a 10-hour time-restricted eating in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The findings provide scientific evidence for clinicians to choose appropriate dietary strategies when treating such patients,"" Zhang said.

Zhang and colleagues performed a single-center, randomized, parallel-controlled trial at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from November 19, 2021 to November 7, 2024.

Ninety patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the IER, TRE or CER group, with consistent weekly caloric intake across all groups. A team of nutritionists supervised the 16-week intervention.

Of those enrolled, 63 completed the study. There were 18 females and 45 males, with an average age of 36.8 years, a mean diabetes duration of 1.5 years, a baseline BMI of 31.7 kg/m², and an HbA1c of 7.42%.

At the end of the study, there were no significant differences in HbA1c reduction and weight loss between the IER, TRE and CER groups. However, the absolute decrease in HbA1c and body weight was greatest in the IER group.

Compared to TRE and CER, IER significantly reduced fasting blood glucose and triglycerides and increased the Matsuda index, a measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity. Uric acid and liver enzyme levels exhibited no statistically significant changes from baseline in any study group.

Two patients in the IER group and the TRE group, and three patients in the CER group, experienced mild hypoglycemia.

The IER group had the highest adherence rate (85%), followed by the CER group at 84% and the TRE group at 78%. Both the IER and CER groups showed statistically significant differences compared with the TRE group.

Zhang said these findings highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of dietary interventions for people who have obesity and type 2 diabetes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Big-Bang echoes unmask a billion-light-year hole around Earth—and it's stretching space faster","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250715043347.htm","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 10:06:04 GMT","

Earth and our entire Milky Way galaxy may sit inside a mysterious giant hole which makes the cosmos expand faster here than in neighboring regions of the universe, astronomers say.

Their theory is a potential solution to the 'Hubble tension' and could help confirm the true age of our universe, which is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old.

The latest research - shared at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting (NAM) in Durham - shows that sound waves from the early universe, ""essentially the sound of the Big Bang,"" support this idea.

The Hubble constant was first proposed by Edwin Hubble in 1929 to express the rate of the universe's expansion. It can be measured by observing the distance of celestial objects and how fast they are moving away from us.

The stumbling block, however, is that extrapolating measurements of the distant, early universe to today using the standard cosmological model predicts a slower rate of expansion than measurements of the nearby, more recent universe. This is the Hubble tension.

""A potential solution to this inconsistency is that our galaxy is close to the center of a large, local void,"" explained Dr Indranil Banik, of the University of Portsmouth.

""It would cause matter to be pulled by gravity towards the higher density exterior of the void, leading to the void becoming emptier with time.

""As the void is emptying out, the velocity of objects away from us would be larger than if the void were not there. This therefore gives the appearance of a faster local expansion rate.""

He added: ""The Hubble tension is largely a local phenomenon, with little evidence that the expansion rate disagrees with expectations in the standard cosmology further back in time.

""So a local solution like a local void is a promising way to go about solving the problem.""

For the idea to stand up, Earth and our solar system would need to be near the center of a void about a billion light-years in radius and with a density about 20 percent below the average for the universe as a whole.

Directly counting galaxies does support the theory, because the number density in our local universe is lower than in neighbouring regions.

However, the existence of such a large and deep void is controversial because it doesn't mesh particularly well with the standard model of cosmology, which suggests matter today should be more uniformly spread out on such large scales.

Despite this, new data presented by Dr Banik at NAM 2025 shows that baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) - the ""sound of the Big Bang"" - support the idea of a local void.

""These sound waves travelled for only a short while before becoming frozen in place once the universe cooled enough for neutral atoms to form,"" he explained.

""They act as a standard ruler, whose angular size we can use to chart the cosmic expansion history.

""A local void slightly distorts the relation between the BAO angular scale and the redshift, because the velocities induced by a local void and its gravitational effect slightly increase the redshift on top of that due to cosmic expansion.

""By considering all available BAO measurements over the last 20 years, we showed that a void model is about one hundred million times more likely than a void-free model with parameters designed to fit the CMB observations taken by the Planck satellite, the so-called homogeneous Planck cosmology.""

The next step for researchers is to compare their local void model with other methods to estimate the history of the universe's expansion, such as cosmic chronometers.

This involves looking at galaxies that are no longer forming stars. By observing their spectra, or light, it is possible to find what kinds of stars they have and in what proportion. Since more massive stars have shorter lives, they are absent in older galaxies, providing a way to establish a galaxy's age.

Astronomers can then combine this age with the galaxy's redshift - how much the wavelength of its light has been stretched - which tells us how much the universe has expanded while light from the galaxy was travelling towards us. This sheds light on the universe's expansion history.

The Hubble constant was first proposed by Edwin Hubble in 1929 to express the rate of the universe's expansion. It can be measured by observing the distance of celestial objects and how fast they are moving away from us.

The Hubble tension refers to the discrepancy in the measured expansion rate of the universe, specifically between the value based on observations of the early universe and value related to observations of the local universe.

Baryon acoustic oscillations are a pattern of wrinkles in the density distribution of the clusters of galaxies spread across the universe. They provide an independent way to measure the expansion rate of the universe and how that rate has changed throughout cosmic history.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Semaglutide melts fat—but may quietly strip away your strength","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250715043349.htm","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:16:36 GMT","

Women and older adults taking the anti-obesity drug semaglutide may be at higher risk for muscle loss, but higher protein intake may help prevent muscle loss in these patients, according to a small study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

Losing muscle (or lean mass) is a common side effect of weight loss in adults with obesity and may negatively affect metabolism and bone health. This is because muscle helps control blood sugar after meals and plays an important role in keeping bones strong, according to study lead researcher Melanie Haines, M.D., of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Mass.

Approximately 40% of the weight lost from taking semaglutide -- a type of weight-loss medication known as a GLP-1 -- comes from lean mass, including muscle. It is not yet known who is at highest risk for muscle loss or how it affects blood sugar levels, Haines said.

The researchers studied 40 adults with obesity for three months. Of these patients, 23 were prescribed semaglutide, while 17 followed a diet and lifestyle program for weight loss called Healthy Habits for Life (HHL). The researchers evaluated how their muscle mass changed.

Study participants who were prescribed semaglutide lost more weight than those who participated in the diet and lifestyle program, but the percent of weight loss that was lean mass was similar between the two groups.

After accounting for weight loss, the researchers found that in the semaglutide group, being older, female or eating less protein was linked to greater muscle loss. Also in this group, losing more muscle was linked to less improvement in blood sugar (HbA1c levels).

""Older adults and women may be more likely to lose muscle on semaglutide, but eating more protein may help protect against this,"" Haines said. ""Losing too much muscle may reduce the benefits of semaglutide on blood sugar control. This means preserving muscle during weight loss with semaglutide may be important to reduce insulin resistance and prevent frailty in people with obesity.""

Haines said that more studies are needed to find the best way to lose fat but keep muscle when using GLP-1 medications.

The anti-obesity medication tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity, reduced obesity-associated breast cancer growth in a mouse model, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, California.

""Obesity is a significant risk factor for breast cancer, and while it is very preliminary data, our studies in mice suggest that these new anti-obesity drugs may be a way to reduce obesity-associated breast cancer risk or improve outcomes,"" said study author Amanda Kucinskas, B.S., a Ph.D. candidate in the labs of Drs. Erin Giles and Kanakadurga Singer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Existing research has shown that having obesity can lead to worse breast cancer outcomes compared to those who do not have obesity, and weight loss can improve outcomes. However, there are many challenges with traditional weight loss methods.

Kucinskas and colleagues leveraged tirzepatide, one of a new class of effective anti-obesity medications that target GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors. The researchers sought to learn whether or not tirzepatide would reduce obesity-associated breast cancer growth.

This mouse study included 16 mice. The 9-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a 40% high-fat diet and housed in a warm environment to induce obesity. At 32 weeks of age, the mice with obesity were randomly assigned injections of tirzepatide or a placebo every other day for 16 weeks. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly.

The researchers found that the anti-obesity drug reduced body weight and body fat by approximately 20% in mice, similar to the amount of weight loss achieved by women on this drug. They found this was primarily due to a loss of adipose mass, with a reduction in adipose depot weights compared to controls.

The anti-obesity drug also reduced tumor volume compared to the controls. At the end of the study, the researchers found that tumor volume was significantly correlated with body weight, total adipose mass and the amount of fat stored in the liver.

""While these are very preliminary results, they suggest that this new anti-obesity drug may also have a beneficial impact on breast cancer outcomes,"" Kucinskas said.

Ongoing studies are underway in collaboration with Dr. Steve Hursting's lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to separate the weight loss from the tumor-specific effects of tirzepatide.

Consuming certain sweeteners commonly found in foods and beverages may increase the risk of early puberty in children, particularly among those who are genetically predisposed, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The researchers found that consuming aspartame, sucralose, glycyrrhizin and added sugars was significantly associated with a higher risk of early puberty, especially in children with certain genetic traits. The more of these sweeteners the teens consumed, the higher their risk of central precocious puberty.

""This study is one of the first to connect modern dietary habits -- specifically sweetener intake -- with both genetic factors and early puberty development in a large, real-world cohort,"" said Yang-Ching Chen, M.D., Ph.D., of Taipei Municipal Wan Fang Hospital and Taipei Medical University in Taipei, Taiwan. ""It also highlights gender differences in how sweeteners affect boys and girls, adding an important layer to our understanding of individualized health risks.""

A type of early puberty known as central precocious puberty is increasingly common. It can lead to emotional distress, shorter adult height, and increased risk of future metabolic and reproductive disorders.

Chen's previous research found that certain sweeteners can directly influence hormones and gut bacteria linked to early puberty. For example, one artificial sweetener called acesulfame potassium or AceK was shown to trigger the release of puberty-related hormones by activating ""sweet taste"" pathways in brain cells and increasing stress-related molecules. Another sweetener, glycyrrhizin -- found in licorice -- was found to change the balance of gut bacteria and reduce the activity of genes involved in triggering puberty.

""This suggests that what children eat and drink, especially products with sweeteners, may have a surprising and powerful impact on their development,"" Chen said.

The new findings come from the Taiwan Pubertal Longitudinal Study (TPLS), begun in 2018. The study included data from 1,407 teens. Central precocious puberty was diagnosed in 481 teens. The researchers assessed teens' sweetener intake through validated questionnaires and testing of urine samples. Genetic predisposition was quantified using polygenic risk scores derived from 19 genes related to central precocious puberty. Early puberty was diagnosed based on medical exams, hormone levels and scans.

Sucralose consumption was linked to a higher risk of central precocious puberty in boys and consumption of glycyrrhizin, sucralose and added sugars was associated with a higher risk of central precocious puberty in girls.

""The findings are directly relevant to families, pediatricians and public health authorities,"" Chen said. ""They suggest that screening for genetic risk and moderating sweetener intake could help prevent early puberty and its long-term health consequences. This could lead to new dietary guidelines or risk assessment tools for children, supporting healthier development.""

Cancer deaths linked to obesity have tripled in the United States over the past two decades, according to a study being presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The study, which examined more than 33,000 deaths from obesity-associated cancers, revealed sharp increases in cancer deaths, especially among women, older adults, Native Americans and Black Americans.

""Obesity is a significant risk factor for multiple cancers, contributing to significant mortality,"" said lead researcher Faizan Ahmed, M.D., of Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune City, N.J. ""This research underscores the need for targeted public health strategies such as early screening and improved access to care, especially in high-risk rural and underserved areas.""

Obesity is a common condition. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 40.3% of adults have obesity. Obesity is a complex disease resulting from multiple genetic, physiological, hormonal, environmental and developmental factors.

In addition to certain types of cancer, obesity raises the risk of developing serious chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and chronic and end-stage kidney disease.

Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing 13 types of cancer, according to the CDC. These cancers make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year.

They are:

Faizan used mortality data from the CDC to analyze 33,572 U.S. deaths from obesity-associated cancers between 1999 and 2020. He found age-adjusted mortality rates increased from 3.73 to 13.52 per million over two decades, with steep increases among women, older adults, Black people, Native Americans and rural populations.

Regionally, the Midwest had the highest rate of obesity-related cancer deaths, while the Northeast had the lowest. State-level analysis revealed that Vermont, Minnesota and Oklahoma had the highest rates, while Utah, Alabama and Virginia had the lowest.

The Human Phenotype Project (HPP) is a large-scale deep-phenotype prospective cohort. To date, approximately 28,000 participants have enrolled, with more than 13,000 completing their initial visit. The project is aimed at identifying novel molecular signatures with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value, and at developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models for disease onset and progression. The HPP includes longitudinal profiling encompassing medical history, lifestyle and nutrition, anthropometrics, blood tests, continuous glucose and sleep monitoring, imaging and multi-omics data, including genetics, transcriptomics, microbiome (gut, vaginal and oral), metabolomics and immune profiling. Analysis of these data highlights the variation of phenotypes with age and ethnicity and unravels molecular signatures of disease by comparison with matched healthy controls. Leveraging extensive dietary and lifestyle data, we identify associations between lifestyle factors and health outcomes. Finally, we present a multi-modal foundation AI model, trained using self-supervised learning on diet and continuous-glucose-monitoring data, that outperforms existing methods in predicting disease onset. This framework can be extended to integrate other modalities and act as a personalized digital twin. In summary, we present a deeply phenotyped cohort that serves as a platform for advancing biomarker discovery, enabling the development of multi-modal AI models and personalized medicine approaches.

The APOE ε4 genetic variant is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is increasingly being implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases. Using the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium SomaScan dataset covering 1,346 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 9,924 plasma samples, we used machine learning-based proteome profiling to identify an APOE ε4 proteomic signature shared across individuals with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and nonimpaired controls. This signature was enriched in pro-inflammatory immune and infection pathways as well as immune cells, including monocytes, T cells and natural killer cells. Analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex proteome for 262 donors from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD UPenn Proteomics Study revealed a consistent APOE ε4 phenotype, independent of neurodegenerative pathology, including amyloid-β tau and gliosis for all diseases, as well as TDP-43 in ALS and FTD cases, and α-synuclein in PD and PDD cases. While systemic proteomic changes were consistent across APOE ε4 carriers, their relationship with clinical and lifestyle factors, such as hypertension and smoking, varied by disease. These findings suggest APOE ε4 confers a systemic biological vulnerability that is necessary but not sufficient for neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need to consider gene–environment interactions. Overall, our study reveals a conserved APOE ε4-associated pro-inflammatory immune signature persistent across the brain, CSF and plasma irrespective of neurodegenerative disease, highlighting a fundamental, disease-independent biological vulnerability to neurodegeneration. This work reframes APOE ε4 as a pleiotropic immune modulator rather than an AD-specific risk gene, providing a foundation for precision biomarker development and early intervention strategies across neurodegenerative diseases.

The ε4 variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) gene is well-established as the largest genetic risk factor of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. Growing evidence, however, indicates that APOE ε4 carriage may also have a role in other age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have linked APOE ε4 to increased risk and lower age of onset of frontotemporal dementia (FTD)2,3,4,5,6, Parkinson's disease (PD)5,7,8 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)9,10. APOE ε4 is also linked to a faster rate of cognitive decline and poor cognition in PD, increasing the risk of PD dementia (PDD)11,12,13,14,15,16. Despite the deleterious impact of APOE ε4, little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this effect and if, or how, it changes across the different neurodegenerative diseases. We recently showed that APOE ε4 carriers, irrespective of cognitive status in AD and mild cognitive impairment, had the same proteomic signature in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associated with a pro-inflammatory immune molecular phenotype17. However, whether this extends to other neurodegenerative diseases is unknown.

To identify systemic proteomic changes associated with APOE ε4 carriers who develop neurodegenerative diseases, we used the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC) dataset. Here the plasma and CSF proteome were assessed using the SomaScan assay for 11,270 APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers with AD, FTD, PD, PDD, ALS and nonimpaired controls. Using supervised machine learning, we identified and characterized an APOE ε4 proteome signature across the CSF and plasma. We then confirmed whether the same APOE ε4-enriched pathways in the periphery were mirrored in the brains of carriers and noncarriers. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) proteome of 262 AD, FTD, PDD, PD, ALS and nonimpaired control donors from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) UPenn Proteomics Study was measured using label-free mass spectrometry (MS). In these samples, we also examined postmortem histopathological markers, including the presence of amyloid-β plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis and angiopathy. In FTD and ALS cases, we also examined TDP-43, while in PD and PDD, we examined α-synuclein. Lastly, to assess potential interactions between proteins in the APOE ε4 signature and environmental variables across the diseases, we performed a correlation network analysis between proteins and 18 clinical and lifestyle variables collected in the GNPC dataset, such as hypertension, smoking, and diabetes (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1a).

CSF proteome profiling reveals a distinct signature in APOE ε4 carriers

We used SomaScan (6,340 proteins measured per sample) proteomic data from the GNPC dataset to profile the CSF proteome of 526 AD, 247 PD and 573 nonimpaired control individuals (Supplementary Table 1). An initial principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that there was no clustering across all 6,340 proteins (Fig. 1b). We used mutual information (>0.01) to identify APOE ε4 proteins. Unlike traditional correlation coefficients, which capture only linear relationships, mutual information can detect both linear and nonlinear associations. This makes it well suited for complex high-dimensional biological data, where relationships between variables may not follow simple patterns. Using this, we identified 229 CSF proteins that were APOE ε4 associated in nonimpaired controls (Methods; Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1a). A subsequent PCA showed that these proteins led to distinct clustering of groups based on APOE genotype (Fig. 1c) and the number of APOE ε4 alleles (Fig. 1d) independently of disease. This effect was further visualized using a heatmap showing that APOE ε4 proteins were upregulated or downregulated based on genotype but not disease (Fig. 1e). Many of these APOE ε4 proteins were also identified in our earlier work profiling the CSF proteome of APOE ε4 carriers with mild cognitive impairment and AD from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative cohort17 further highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our finding.

Using classification and regression trees (CART) modeling, we showed that these 229 CSF proteins were able to reliably (performance metrics > 0.95) predict APOE ε4 carriers from noncarriers across AD and PD (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1f). We also found that there were no sex differences in the ability of our identified proteins to distinguish between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1f). To determine if the APOE ε4 signature might be due to differences in amyloid-β levels between carriers and noncarriers, we examined CSF amyloid-β A4 protein levels measured in the SomaScan assay. A Wilcoxon test indicated that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in CSF amyloid-β A4 protein levels between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers with AD, PD or nonimpaired controls (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

A functional enrichment analysis in the protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) database18 of the CSF APOE ε4 proteins revealed significant (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) enrichment for viral processes, apoptosis, rhythmicity, cellular processes, protein phosphorylation and folding and RNA/DNA processes (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 3). Given that the most significant enrichment was observed for viral processes, we also performed enrichment analysis for immune pathway-specific processes. Immune-specific Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways revealed that APOE ε4 proteins were enriched in numerous infection-related pathways, including hepatitis, herpes, measles, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and influenza A. There was also significant enrichment for T cell, B cell and inflammatory signaling cascades, including Toll‑like receptor (TLR), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 17 (IL-17), JAK/STAT and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB; Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 3). Using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas19, we performed an immune cell subtype enrichment analysis on APOE ε4 proteins. Across innate immune cells, APOE ε4 proteins were the most enriched in nonclassical and intermediate monocytes. In adaptive immune cells, memory CD8 T cells were the most enriched for APOE ε4 proteins, followed by Tregs and memory CD4 T cells. In innate-like T cells and lymphoid cells (mixed), both natural killer (NK) cells and γδ T cells showed APOE ε4 enrichment (Fig. 1i). Given that we found enrichment for hepatitis KEGG pathways, we also performed a cell-type-specific enrichment analysis in the liver. Across parenchymal cells, APOE ε4 proteins were the most enriched in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, in line with both cell types being the primary producers of the APOE4 proteoform in the liver20 (Fig. 1j).

These results show that APOE ε4 carriers have a distinct CSF proteomic signature characterized by enriched viral processes and pro-inflammatory immune pathways and cells. We find enrichment across hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the liver, further implicating APOE4 proteoform synthesis sites in the periphery. This finding may also be reflective of brain-liver signaling and liver responses to neuroinflammation21. Notably, these changes were independent of neurodegenerative disease and sex, suggesting that APOE ε4 carriers share a common molecular phenotype.

We next sought to determine whether the APOE ε4 CSF proteome changes observed were also reflected in the plasma. Further leveraging the GNPC dataset, we performed plasma proteome profiling of 2,929 AD, 75 FTD, 169 PDD, 422 PD, 230 ALS and 6,099 nonimpaired control individuals with and without an APOE ε4 allele (Supplementary Table 1). A PCA of all 6,340 proteins revealed no group clustering (Fig. 2a). Using mutual information, we identified 58 plasma proteins in nonimpaired controls (Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2a) that were associated with APOE genotype (Fig. 2b) and led to clustering based on the number of APOE ε4 alleles (Fig. 2c) rather than by neurodegenerative disease. A heatmap also revealed that the 58 APOE ε4 plasma changes were upregulated or downregulated based on genotype (Fig. 2d). Two of these proteins, TBCA and LRRN1, were also identified in the serum of healthy APOE ε4 centenarians22, providing further external validation of our finding and the importance of these proteins in APOE ε4 carriers.

This showed significant (FDR < 0.05) enrichment for immune, infection and pro-inflammatory pathways. h, Immune cell-type-specific enrichment analysis of APOE ε4 plasma proteins showing involvement across the innate, adaptive and innate-like T cells and lymphoid cells (mixed). i, Liver cell-type-specific enrichment analysis of APOE ε4 CSF proteins showing involvement across parenchymal and immune cells.

CART models using these 58 proteins as predictors showed a strong ability to differentiate between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers across each of the neurodegenerative disease groups (performance metrics > 0.85; Extended Data Table 2). CART modeling revealed that there were no sex differences in the APOE ε4 plasma signature (Extended Data Table 2 and Fig. 2e). We extended this to show that there were no effects of race. Here we trained our models on White individuals and tested them using proteomic data from either Black/African American or American Indian/Alaskan Native individuals. In both cases, our models were reliably able to predict APOE ε4 carriers from noncarriers (Extended Data Table 2 and Fig. 2e). We also compared amyloid-β A4 protein levels between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers across neurodegenerative diseases to determine if the plasma APOE ε4 signature was related to amyloid-β pathology. A Wilcoxon test revealed that there were no significant differences in plasma amyloid-β A4 protein between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

APOE ε4 plasma processes were significantly enriched for biological processes, including apoptosis, cellular processes, protein processes and RNA/DNA processes (Supplementary Table 5). As in the CSF, viral processes were the most significantly enriched biological process (Fig. 2f). This was further supported by similar KEGG immune and infection pathway enrichments, including EBV and hepatitis (Fig. 2g). There was also significant enrichment for inflammatory and cytokine signaling pathways, including TNF, IL-17, TLR and NF-κB (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 5). Among immune cell subtypes, nonclassical and intermediate monocytes were implicated in APOE ε4 proteins, as seen in the CSF. Unlike the CSF, however, basophils were enriched for APOE ε4 proteins. Of adaptive immune cell subtypes, plasma APOE ε4 proteins were enriched for memory CD8 T cells, Tregs and naive CD8 T cells. NK cells and γδ T cells were also associated with APOE ε4 (Fig. 2h). In the liver, we found cell-type-specific enrichment primarily for Kupffer cells and T cells and, unlike the CSF, very little enrichment for hepatocytes.

Our results demonstrate that genotype-specific proteomic changes observed in the CSF are also reflected in the plasma of APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers, consistently indicating pro-inflammatory immune dysregulation across multiple pathways and immune cell populations. The APOE ε4 proteomic signature remained independent of neurodegenerative disease status and sex, with CART models showing strong predictive power for carrier status. We further showed that this signature generalizes across racial groups, underscoring its robustness and broad applicability. Unlike in the CSF, plasma APOE ε4 proteins were not enriched in hepatocytes but were significantly enriched in Kupffer and T cells, suggesting that peripheral immune activation is distinct from central nervous system (CNS) immune-metabolic signaling along the liver-brain axis in APOE ε4 carriers.

We then sought to determine whether the proteomic changes observed in the periphery were reflective of central changes in APOE ε4 carriers and to further validate our findings from the GNPC cohort. To do this, we leveraged label-free MS proteomic and postmortem histopathological data from the AMP-AD UPenn Proteomics study for the dlPFC of 49 AD, 31 FTD, 47 PDD, 33 PD, 55 ALS and 47 nonimpaired individual donors (Supplementary Table 6). SomaScan and label-free MS proteomic assays had different coverage of specific proteins; therefore, we focused on confirming enrichment for biological processes and pathways across the CSF, plasma, and dlPFC of carriers and noncarriers. We again used mutual information to identify APOE ε4 proteins from the dlPFC within each group independently. Across all neurodegenerative disease groups, we identified 248 APOE ε4 proteins (Supplementary Table 7). This was confirmed with PCAs showing clustering based on APOE genotype (Extended Data Fig. 3a–l and Supplementary Table 7). Functional enrichment analyses revealed that three of the main biological processes (viral processes, negative regulation of apoptosis, and protein folding) identified in the CSF and plasma were also significantly enriched in the dlPFC of APOE ε4 carriers across all neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 8). Further, four of the most significantly enriched KEGG immune pathways in the CSF and plasma were also identified in APOE ε4 carriers in a disease-independent manner, including EBV, hepatitis B, viral carcinogenesis and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Table 8).

Previous research suggests that APOE ε4 carriers may develop neurodegenerative pathology, including amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, even in the absence of symptomatic disease8,23,24,25,26. We therefore sought to determine if the changes seen in APOE ε4 carriers may be due to the presence of APOE ε4-driven brain pathology. There was no relationship between APOE ε4 and tau or thio-S-positive plaques across nonimpaired controls and disease groups (Supplementary Table 9). In FTD, PDD, and PD, there was also no relationship between APOE ε4 and α-synuclein and, in FTD and ALS, no relationship with TDP-43 (Supplementary Table 9). Although none of the neurodegenerative disease groups showed a relationship between APOE ε4 and angiopathy, there was a small statistically significant association found in nonimpaired controls (Supplementary Table 9).

Taken together, these findings suggest a relationship between peripheral and central proteomic changes. Both are characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, further highlighting that APOE ε4 carriers have systemic immune dysregulation. This demonstrates that the major proteome changes seen in the periphery of APOE ε4 carriers are indeed reflective of ongoing processes in the brain and that peripheral processes may actively contribute to or even drive changes in the brain proteome. Notably, APOE ε4-associated changes are independent of neurodegenerative disease, whether measured simply by diagnosis or by specific pathological changes in the brain.

Given that APOE ε4 carriers across neurodegenerative diseases share major underlying systemic proteomic changes, we sought to better understand additional drivers that may be disease specific. To do this, we leveraged the GNPC dataset and a correlation network analysis to identify the relationship between APOE ε4 proteins and demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, such as age, blood pressure, and smoking (Supplementary Table 1 and see Extended Data Fig. 4 for a stratification by comorbidities for APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers). Of the 40 proteins that overlapped across the CSF and plasma of APOE ε4 carriers, we chose 16 of these that had more than 20 functional connections (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 10). These proteins represent central ‘nodes' in the protein–protein network, suggesting that any changes are more likely to disrupt diverse pathways and functions27. Of note, two of the overlapping proteins, APOE and PHGDH, were differentially expressed in opposite directions across the plasma and CSF. Both proteins were upregulated in the CSF but downregulated in the plasma. As we had a higher number of individuals with plasma samples, thereby improving statistical power, the correlation analysis reflects the decreased APOE and PHGDH levels observed in plasma.

We first calculated Spearman's rank correlation (continuous variables) or correlation ratio (categorical variables) for APOE and demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables in nonimpaired, AD, PDD and PD APOE ε4 carriers. Due to low numbers, we were unable to calculate similar correlations for FTD and ALS. Our analyses revealed unique, neurodegenerative disease-specific significant relationships with APOE (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 11). APOE was associated with sex and race in AD, with diabetes in PD, with resting heart rate and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in PDD, and with age, body mass index, and hypertension in nonimpaired controls. A key limitation is the lack of longitudinal data for nonimpaired APOE ε4 carriers, who may later develop neurodegenerative disease. Thus, observed associations with clinical variables may reflect preclinical disease. We extended these correlation analyses to the remaining 15 central node APOE ε4 proteins. This analysis further identified that APOE ε4 central node proteins are significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables in a disease-specific way in APOE ε4 carriers (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 11).

Together, these findings indicate that although all APOE ε4 carriers have the same underlying proteomic signature, specific proteins within this signature are differentially correlated with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables. Critically, these correlations were neurodegenerative disease specific.

The GNPC dataset represents a substantial advancement in neurodegenerative disease research, by providing a real-world clinical proteomic dataset that comprises over 35,000 (11,270 with APOE genotype) individuals across AD, FTD, PDD, PD, ALS and normal aging from across more than 20 clinical sites in the US, UK and Europe28. This enabled us to ask whether the APOE ε4-associated proteomic signature is shared across multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Our results demonstrate that all APOE ε4 carriers, irrespective of neurodegenerative disease, have a unique proteome signature that extends across the plasma and CSF. Unlike prospectively designed cohorts, the GNPC dataset reflects real-world clinical heterogeneity, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our findings. This signature is associated with pro-inflammatory immune dysregulation and an enrichment for circulating immune cells, including monocytes, memory CD8 and γδ T cells, Tregs and NK cells. This molecular phenotype extends to the brains of APOE ε4 carriers in a similar disease-independent manner and is not associated with the presence of any disease-specific brain pathology (Fig. 5). Although all APOE ε4 carriers have a systemic immune-related proteome signature, we find that the relationships between proteins within this signature are uniquely associated with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables in a neurodegenerative disease-specific manner. Notably, this suggests that although the biological changes associated with APOE ε4 carriage are essential for neurodegeneration, broadly, interactions with underlying biological vulnerability and the environment may be key for driving the pathogenesis of the specific neurodegenerative disease.

APOE ε4 carriers across different neurodegenerative diseases share a common systemic proteomic change reflective of pro-inflammatory immune dysregulation. The figure is created with BioRender.com.

There is evidence that the APOE ε4 genotype is a modern-day example of antagonistic pleiotropy. In younger adults, APOE ε4 is associated with increased survival and fertility in environments with high levels of infectious disease29,30,31,32. For example, healthy individuals who are APOE ε4 heterozygotes exhibit heightened cytokine release, increased plasma TNF levels, a more pronounced hyperthermic response and an earlier onset of IL-6 production following immune challenge with TLR2/TLR4/TLR5 ligands or lipopolysaccharide33. While this immune response protects younger APOE ε4 carriers from infectious diseases, prolonged states of inflammation and cytokine release are likely deleterious with age34,35. Although this study identified a proteomic signature indicative of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, a limitation is the absence of direct measures of routine inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein or cytokines. Future studies should incorporate these markers in prospectively designed cohorts to clarify their association with APOE ε4.

To date, the biological effects of APOE ε4 carriage have largely only been studied in the context of AD. A notable finding of our study is that the pro-inflammatory molecular phenotype associated with APOE ε4 extends to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases, including FTD, PDD, PD and ALS. This raises two key considerations. First, our findings underscore the need to shift focus from the continued identification of genetic risk loci via genome-wide association studies toward functional characterization of established variants36. Notably, the absence of a statistically significant association between a variant and a specific disease phenotype does not preclude biological relevance. Despite APOE ε4 being overrepresented in the AD cohort, we observe a consistent molecular signature associated with APOE ε4 across multiple neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting an underrecognized role for this variant beyond AD that may have been overlooked due to its historically strong link with AD risk. Second, our data support reconceptualizing APOE ε4 not only as a disease-specific risk factor but also as a broader susceptibility allele contributing to shared pathogenic mechanisms across neurodegenerative diseases. It remains unclear, however, why APOE ε4 is more strongly associated with AD in terms of prevalence despite exhibiting systemic biological effects across neurodegenerative diseases. One possibility is that interactions between APOE ε4 and additional age-related, environmental, or comorbid factors may selectively amplify neurodegenerative pathways characteristic of AD. Another possibility is that CNS-specific vulnerabilities or cellular contexts (for example, in hippocampal circuits or dopaminergic neurons) modulate how the APOE ε4 inflammatory phenotype manifests clinically. Thus, while APOE ε4 confers a shared biological susceptibility, disease expression likely depends on a combination of genetic background, cellular context(s), and lifetime exposures. Large-scale integrative efforts, such as the GNPC, which harmonize data across distinct disease cohorts into unified datasets, provide a powerful framework for advancing this line of inquiry. By enabling cross-disease comparisons, such efforts may help delineate modifiers that influence why some APOE ε4 carriers develop AD while others remain healthy or develop different neurodegenerative diseases. This has important implications for prognosis and risk stratification in midlife individuals who carry APOE ε4.

A limitation of our study is the absence of validated biomarkers (for example, CSF p-tau217) to confirm clinical diagnoses, which reflects both the nature of the GNPC dataset and global heterogeneity in clinical practice28. However, several features mitigate concerns regarding potential misdiagnosis. First, the APOE ε4 signature was derived from nonimpaired individuals. While it is possible that a minority of these nonimpaired individuals harbored asymptomatic pathology (for example, asymptomatic AD), the majority would be free of overt disease, reducing the likelihood of confounding results. Second, the consistent presence of the signature across all APOE ε4 carriers, irrespective of clinical diagnosis, supports its generalizability and suggests it reflects a broader APOE ε4-related biological phenotype rather than disease-specific changes. Finally, we validate our findings using postmortem brain proteomics and histopathology, where diagnostic certainty is highest. Here APOE ε4 status was not associated with hallmark pathologies, including amyloid-β, tau, TDP-43 or α-synuclein, across respective disease groups. This postmortem validation reinforces the robustness of our findings. Future studies would benefit from prospective cohorts incorporating validated CSF or plasma biomarkers to confirm and extend these observations.

An unexpected finding of our study was that plasma neurofilament light (NEFL) levels were lower in APOE ε4 carriers across neurodegenerative diseases, despite NEFL's growing recognition as a biomarker of neurodegeneration37. Prior studies have reported conflicting results—some found no association38,39, another reported increased levels in APOE ε4 carriers40, while others using the SomaScan41 and Simoa42 assays observed decreased levels, consistent with our findings. These discrepancies may reflect differences in sample size, with studies reporting decreased NEFL levels generally including larger cohorts (~600 to 5,000 participants, and 9,924 in our study). Alternatively, APOE ε4-related blood–brain barrier (BBB) or metabolic dysfunction may alter peripheral clearance of NEFL and affect its plasma or CSF concentration. These results raise important questions about the reliability of NEFL as a stand-alone biomarker and underscore the need for mechanistic studies and a shift toward precision biomarkers that integrate genetic and environmental context.

In our study, key peripheral inflammatory states in APOE ε4 carriers were mirrored in the CNS. Notably, brain proteomics performed using label-free MS orthogonally validated findings from SomaScan-based CSF and plasma analyses. While SomaScan aptamer technology offers high-throughput protein quantification, it is relatively insensitive to proteoform diversity, including post-translational modifications43, a limitation when examining signaling pathways and protein networks where such modifications are functionally significant. In contrast, MS enables the detection of broader proteoforms, offering an independent assessment of protein abundance and pathway enrichment. The concordance of APOE ε4-associated protein signatures and enrichment patterns across plasma, CSF and brain proteomic datasets suggests that our findings are not artifacts of platform-specific biases but likely reflect underlying biology. Supporting this interpretation, we observed enrichment of APOE ε4-associated proteins in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the CSF, but only in Kupffer cells and T cells in plasma. This pattern implies that plasma reflects chronic peripheral immune activation, whereas the CSF may capture liver-brain axis-mediated inflammatory signaling in APOE ε4 carriers21. Further experimental studies are warranted to validate these mechanisms. Prospective cohort studies incorporating cross-platform, multi-tissue analyses from the same individuals will be essential to confirm and expand upon these observations.

While the exact mechanisms underlying the mirroring of peripheral and central pro-inflammatory states remain unclear, they may involve interactions between pro-inflammatory peripheral immune cells and the BBB. A recent study of individuals with long COVID-19 demonstrated that hyperactive peripheral blood mononuclear cells adhere to the endothelial cells of the BBB, driving inflammation, degradation, and symptoms of brain fog44. In support of this, cognitively healthy APOE ε4 carriers exhibit early markers of BBB dysfunction in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe45. As the BBB becomes increasingly compromised, it allows the infiltration of blood-derived proteins and pro-inflammatory immune cells into the brain, contributing to exacerbated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration46. In our study, we identify enriched pro-inflammatory immune cell subpopulations, including nonclassical and intermediate monocytes47,48, memory CD8+ T cells49, γδ T cells50 and NK cells51,52. These immune cell types may represent peripheral blood mononuclear cells that interact with the BBB to promote neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 carriers. Given that APOE ε4 is linked to a shared molecular phenotype across neurodegenerative diseases, this hypothesis is consistent with current understanding. Healthy, nonimpaired APOE ε4 carriers have a systemic pro-inflammatory phenotype17 (and as we have shown here), early signs of BBB disruption45, alterations in brain activity and connectivity53,54, and sleep disturbances55, all of which are known to be risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, broadly56,57,58. Further supporting this is the recent evidence that vaccinations protect against dementia59,60, including the shingles vaccines Zostavax61 and Shingrix62. Although none of these studies explicitly examined the interactive effects between vaccination status and APOE ε4 genotype, the fact that more than 60% of individuals with dementia are APOE ε4 carriers63 suggests that APOE ε4 may represent a critical modifier of the observed associations, warranting further investigation. Future studies in human disease-relevant models, such as patient stem cell-derived organoids, are needed to further elucidate these mechanisms.

If all APOE ε4 carriers share a common underlying biological vulnerability to neurodegeneration, an important question is what determines which specific neurodegenerative disease they develop. This likely reflects complex interactions between genetic risk and environmental exposures64. In our study, proteins within the APOE ε4 signature were differentially correlated with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables, in a neurodegenerative disease-specific manner. This suggests that genotype–environment interactions may modulate disease trajectories in APOE ε4 carriers. While limited by the variables consistently collected across the GNPC's global real-world cohorts, our findings highlight meaningful associations that warrant further investigation. Future prospective studies should incorporate more detailed environmental and behavioral measures, such as physical activity, diet, sleep, substance use and immunization history, to better characterize modifiers of neurodegenerative disease risk in APOE ε4 carriers. Given the cross-sectional nature of our study, we cannot infer causality or perform mediation analyses, as clinical variables like hypertension may have arisen after disease onset. One plausible mechanism is that APOE ε4 carriers exhibit heightened inflammatory responses to environmental or pathological stressors, including comorbidities such as hypercholesterolemia and ischemic heart disease, to which they are predisposed65,66,67. This suggests that the pro-inflammatory phenotype of APOE ε4 carriers may be, at least in part, independent of cardiovascular comorbidities. Our findings further support this interpretation. Our PANTHER biological processes enrichment analyses of the APOE ε4 CSF proteome showed no significant enrichment of cardiovascular-related processes. In the plasma, we found only a single enrichment for heart development; however, this was modest relative to the top enrichment of viral processes. These results suggest that additional environmental or pathological insults may act synergistically with a genetically primed pro-inflammatory state to drive neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 carriers. Another interpretation of our data, however, is that individuals with pre-existing neurodegenerative diseases are more likely to develop comorbidities68,69, such as hypertension, which may be a consequence of neurodegenerative processes rather than a precursory event. Longitudinal studies tracking APOE ε4 carriers over time will be essential to disentangle causal pathways and advance personalized prevention strategies.

Neurodegenerative disease risk is reflective of a complex polygenic architecture and co-occurring variants in genes, such as TREM2, MAPT, GRN, GBA and LRRK2, may modulate or interact with APOE ε4-associated molecular pathways. For example, joint carriage of APOE ε4 and MAPT mutations resulted in a significantly lower age of FTD onset6. APOE ε4 and GBA and LRRK2 carriers also have the highest risk of PDD13. Genome-wide genetic data beyond APOE genotype, however, are not currently available within the GNPC cohort and therefore could not be included in the present study. Despite this, a key strength of our study is the demonstration that a well-established risk variant for one neurodegenerative disease (APOE ε4 in AD) also exerts a conserved molecularsignature across multiple neurodegenerative conditions. These findings provide proteomic evidence that a single risk variant is implicated across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum. This indicates the need for a conceptual shift in the field, moving away from viewing genetic risk variants as disease specific and toward recognizing their potential as shared, pleiotropic modifiers of neurodegenerative vulnerability. Future work, therefore, would greatly benefit from a focus on the role of other genetic variants across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, even if they are enriched in only one disease.

Overall, our study provides a conceptual and translational advance in understanding APOE ε4-mediated risk for neurodegeneration. We identify a conserved, systemic pro-inflammatory immune proteomic signature associated with APOE ε4 across plasma, CSF and brain, irrespective of neurodegenerative disease or pathology. Notably, this signature is also present in asymptomatic individuals, suggesting it precedes clinical symptom onset and reflects an intrinsic biological vulnerability. The ability to detect this signature in plasma, a minimally invasive and clinically accessible biofluid, also offers promising opportunities for blood-based precision biomarkers to identify individuals at risk before symptom onset. Together, these findings demonstrate that APOE ε4 confers an intrinsic biological vulnerability characterized by a chronic pro-inflammatory immune phenotype that is independent of downstream disease processes. While this chronic immune activation may predispose APOE ε4 carriers to neurodegeneration, it is unlikely to be sufficient alone to drive the development of neurodegenerative disease. Instead, the transition to clinical disease likely involves complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and modifiable environmental, lifestyle, and clinical factors. By linking the APOE ε4 signature to such factors, our findings provide actionable insights for early intervention and prevention. They also establish a roadmap for future exploration of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions, including polygenic and epistatic effects. More broadly, our findings reframe APOE ε4 as a pleiotropic immune modulator rather than an AD-specific gene, underscoring the need for cross-disease, genetically informed models of risk stratification and therapy. Finally, this work lays the foundation for future wet laboratory-based mechanistic studies to elucidate how APOE ε4 shapes immune function and neuroinflammatory signaling, a critical step toward developing targeted and individualized immunotherapies for early and preclinical disease.

The GNPC cohort represents the largest collection of SomaScan proteomic data for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and nonimpaired controls sourced from study sites across the USA, UK and Europe. In the present study, we included 11,270 individuals from the GNPC cohort, with 6,672 nonimpaired controls, 3,455 AD, 75 FTD, 169 PDD, 669 PD and 230 ALS individuals. Of these, 4,325 individuals were APOE ε4 carriers (either heterozygous or homozygous) and 6,945 were non-APOE ε4 carriers. All included individuals in the study provided either CSF or plasma samples, but none provided both. Individuals were diagnosed based on diagnostic criteria from each research group, as described in the GNPC cohort summary paper1. Cognitive impairment for AD and PDD patients was further assessed using a clinical dementia rating score of ≥1, Mini-Mental State Exam score of ≤24 and/or Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of ≤23. Most individuals with AD had cognitive impairment scores indicative of mild or moderate AD. We excluded individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the current study due to its heterogeneity as a clinical diagnosis, and because it does not necessarily reflect neurodegenerative pathology. CSF or plasma samples were collected from all participants at a single timepoint along with demographic and clinical variables (Supplementary Table 1). Participants from each of the included study sites in the GNPC cohort provided written informed consent and studies were approved by the relevant institution's ethics committee28.

The AMP-AD UPenn Proteomics Study is a cohort of autopsy-collected samples from the dlPFC of 49 AD, 31 FTD (with TDP-43 inclusions), 47 PDD, 33 PD, 55 ALS and 47 nonimpaired individual donors from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Brain Bank (https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn21438414). Individual diagnoses were confirmed through postmortem neuropathological evaluation for neuritic plaque distribution according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD criteria70 and neurofibrillary tangle pathology according to the Braak staging system71. Other neuropathologic assessments, including for α-synuclein, TDP-43, gliosis and angiopathy, were made in line with established criteria and guidelines72,73. Demographic variables for the cohort are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Human postmortem tissues were acquired under proper institutional review board protocols.

CSF and plasma proteomics in the GNPC cohort were performed using the SomaScan v4.1 assay, which measures approximately 7,000 proteins74,75. This technology uses aptamer-based approaches, specifically slow off-rate modified aptamers, which incorporate chemically modified nucleotides that bind with high specificity and affinity to target proteins74. SomaLogic provides ‘raw' data that has been standardized, normalized, and calibrated, including using adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood. Protein measurements are provided in relative fluorescent units. Aptamers were mapped to Uniprot before being included in the GNPC cohort dataset. Details on the creation and harmonization of this dataset are described elsewhere28. Before our own analyses, we log2 transformed and standardized training and testing datasets separately.

Proteins from postmortem brain homogenates from the dlPFC were measured using label-free MS on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer as previously described76. Proteins included in this study were identified using MaxQuant' MaxLFQ (label-free quantification) algorithm. Normalized label-free quantitation protein intensities were extracted from the proteinGroups.txt MaxQuant output file using a custom R script (LoaderAndBatchCorrection-UPenn354cases.R)76. To account for missing protein quantitation values in the dataset, we imputed values using the median for proteins with ≤20% missing values and excluded those proteins with ≥20% missing values.

We identified APOE ε4-associated proteins using mutual information, a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of information one variable provides about another77. In the context of our study, it measures how informative each protein is for distinguishing APOE ε4 carriers from noncarriers. A mutual information score of zero indicates no association, while higher values indicate greater dependency between a protein and APOE ε4 status. We used a cutoff of ≥0.01 to indicate proteins that were likely to be associated with APOE ε4 carrier status. For CSF and plasma, we used nonimpaired controls to identify APOE ε4-associated proteins. This ensured that we were identifying proteins in only those individuals who are not symptomatic for any one neurodegenerative disease. Appropriate feature selection (identification of proteins specifically associated with APOE ε4) was further confirmed using PCA and heatmap. In the brain, we used mutual information to identify APOE ε4 proteins specific to each group of individuals. PCA was then used to confirm that within each group, APOE ε4-identified proteins clustered based on APOE ε4 carrier status. For visualization of differential protein abundance, volcano plots were constructed using log2 (fold change(FC)) on the x axis and −log10-transformed adjusted P values on the y axis. Plots show fold change and significance thresholds that were applied at log2(FC) = ± 0.585 (corresponding to a 1.5-fold change) and FDR-adjusted P < 0.05, respectively. Mutual information was calculated in R (v4.4.1) using the package ‘FSelectorRcpp'78 and PCA plots and heatmaps were made using ‘ggplot2'79 and ‘pheatmap', respectively.

The generalizability of our identified APOE ε4 proteins across different neurodegenerative diseases was tested. We performed this analysis using supervised machine learning with CART via the ‘caret' package in R (v4.4.1). For all CART models, we first split the dataset into a 70% training and validation dataset and a 30% withheld (unseen) testing dataset. Model training and evaluation were conducted using ‘caret' with a fivefold cross-validation procedure repeated five times. Where classes (groups) were imbalanced, we addressed this by using upsampling. Model performance was assessed using the 30% unseen dataset and several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve. To identify potential sex-specific differences in the generalizability of APOE ε4 proteins, we trained and tested the CART models on a mixed sample of male and female APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers. To assess any race-specific effects in plasma, we trained the CART models on White APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers and then tested them using only individuals of another race (Black/African American or American Indian/Alaskan Native).

To identify a potential relationship between APOE ε4 carrier status and postmortem histopathology in the dlPFC, we used a linear regression. Postmortem histopathology data for all donors included tau, thio-S-positive plaques, and angiopathy. Additional measures for AD and nonimpaired donors included antibody-positive plaques, Thal amyloid score, and gliosis. FTD, PDD and PD donors also had postmortem histopathological assessments for α-synuclein. FTD and ALS donors included TDP-43 assessments.

To determine a potential relationship between overlapping CSF and plasma proteins identified as being APOE ε4-specific and demographic, clinical and lifestyle variables, we performed a correlation network analysis. Protein levels were based on those measured in the plasma, although only overlapping APOE ε4 identified across both CSF and plasma were included. Before computing any correlations, rows with missing values or encoded as an indeterminate response (for example, ‘unsure', coded as −1 or NA) were excluded on a pairwise basis. This ensured that each test was conducted only on complete and valid data. For associations between two continuous variables, we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ). For associations between categorical variables and continuous protein expression values, we employed a correlation ratio (η2), which measures the proportion of variance in the continuous variable explained by the grouping variable. This was calculated by fitting a linear model with the continuous variable as the outcome and the categorical variable as the predictor. The coefficient of determination (R2) from the model was interpreted as η2. The statistical significance of the association was determined using ANOVA (P < 0.05). Categorical variables included binary indicators (for example, presence/absence of comorbidities) as well as variables with more than two levels (for example, ‘yes', ‘no', ‘unsure'). All categorical variables were explicitly converted to factors, and associations were computed only where at least two factor levels were present in the subset of complete cases. The correlation network analysis figure was created using GraphPad Prism (v10.0.0 for Windows).

Protein–protein enrichment analyses to assess the functions enriched for APOE ε4 proteins were done using NetworkAnalyst (v3.0)80,81,82. Here generic protein–protein interactions were identified using a first-order network from the International Molecular Exchange Consortium interactome database83 and InnateDB84. Network enrichment for biological processes was performed using the PANTHER classification system18 and KEGG pathways85. Significance was determined by an FDR of >0.05.

Immune cell-type-specific enrichment analyses for immune and liver cells were done using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/, v23; Ensembl v109)19. For each APOE ε4 protein, we identified the corresponding protein-coding transcripts per million counts. We then normalized the expression for each cell type using min–max scaling and used heatmaps to visually represent these enrichments. Enrichment bar graphs and heatmaps were created using GraphPad Prism (v10.0.0 for Windows).

More than 57 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, a figure expected to double every 20 years. Despite this growing burden, there are currently no cures, and treatment options remain limited due to disease heterogeneity, prolonged preclinical and prodromal phases, poor understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic challenges. Identifying novel biomarkers is crucial for improving early detection, prognosis, staging and subtyping of these conditions. High-dimensional molecular studies in biofluids (‘omics') offer promise for scalable biomarker discovery, but challenges in assembling large, diverse datasets hinder progress. To address this, the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC)—a public–private partnership—established one of the world's largest harmonized proteomic datasets. It includes approximately 250 million unique protein measurements from multiple platforms from more than 35,000 biofluid samples (plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid) contributed by 23 partners, alongside associated clinical data spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This dataset is accessible to GNPC members via the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative's AD Workbench, a secure cloud-based environment, and will be available to the wider research community on 15 July 2025. Here we present summary analyses of the plasma proteome revealing disease-specific differential protein abundance and transdiagnostic proteomic signatures of clinical severity. Furthermore, we describe a robust plasma proteomic signature of APOE ε4 carriership, reproducible across AD, PD, FTD and ALS, as well as distinct patterns of organ aging across these conditions. This work demonstrates the power of international collaboration, data sharing and open science to accelerate discovery in neurodegeneration research.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other related conditions, affect more than 57 million people worldwide1. Until recently, treatment options were limited to managing symptoms, but approvals for disease-modifying drugs for AD and genetic forms of ALS point to considerable progress2,3. Eventually, it may be possible to provide patients with targeted treatments, possibly in combination, that can prevent, slow, stop or reverse the progression of their disease4,5,6. However, several major obstacles have delayed the realization of this vision. First, many neurodegenerative conditions have an extended preclinical or prodromal period where diagnosis using available symptom-based assessments is either not possible or extremely difficult due to subtle manifestations that are not detectable by current clinical tools. Second, heterogeneity in the concordance between molecular pathology and clinical syndrome as well as common co-occurrence of multiple pathologies (‘co-pathology') contribute to misdiagnosis in clinical settings. Third, additional variability exists in the rate and pattern of symptom progression within conditions, impeding efforts to accurately prognosticate disease course. These diagnostic and prognostic challenges ultimately hinder the efficacy of clinical trials and make successful treatment of patients with any approved disease-modifying therapy challenging.

Biomarkers have the potential to resolve some of these obstacles by enabling earlier diagnosis linked to pathological processes, providing methods to subtype diseases, predicting outcomes and ultimately guiding effective intervention7,8. They may also improve clinical trial design through precision recruitment and serve as pharmacodynamic or surrogate endpoints in experimental medicine. Recognizing this potential, the field has seen rapid advances in imaging and fluid biomarker research, leading to their growing incorporation into clinical trials and regulatory frameworks. Fluid biomarkers, in particular, offer a real-time window into brain pathology and may help bridge the longstanding disconnect between neuropathology and clinical symptoms in living patients. Reflecting this progress, clinical guidelines have begun to integrate fluid biomarkers into routine diagnostic workflows9. To date, fluid biomarker development has been most successful for AD, where markers of amyloid and tau pathology are now widely used. However, there remains an urgent need for reliable biomarkers of other neurodegenerative pathologies, including α-synuclein, TDP-43 and non-AD tauopathies. In addition, biomarkers that reflect non-specific but disease-relevant biological processes, such as neuroinflammation, metabolic dysregulation and vascular dysfunction, are essential to fully characterize the pathophysiological and molecular landscape of neurodegeneration.

The accelerating development of high-throughput molecular profiling technologies, combined with increasingly powerful computational tools applied to large, deeply phenotyped cohorts, is transforming the landscape of biomarker discovery10. Although multi-omics approaches, such as integration of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, contribute to rich data-driven biomarker discovery, proteomics is uniquely positioned to impact both diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease. This is due to several key factors: (1) many clinically established biomarkers are protein based; (2) high-dimensional proteomic platforms such as SomaScan, Olink and mass spectrometry now offer sufficient depth to capture a sizable portion of the circulating proteome; and (3) protein-level changes often capture biological processes proximal to neurodegeneration, providing functional insights that are directly relevant to disease pathogenesis. Proteomic profiles derived from peripheral biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) not only hold promise for identifying biomarkers of disease presence and progression but also offer new avenues for therapeutic target discovery.

Robust high-dimensionality omics research in heterogeneous clinical groups necessitates the use of large datasets due to poor reproducibility of findings from single-site or smaller cohorts11, but the siloing of data among a fragmented research community has been a barrier to such biomarker discovery12. Although many research institutions and initiatives have embarked on a variety of open data efforts, there is no standard model for providing researchers with easy access to data from multiple cohorts. Moreover, the use of such multicohort sources requires data aggregation and harmonization. The genetics research community has enabled huge consortia with joint data access and collaborative analysis13. In the field of neurodegenerative disease, large data-sharing efforts such as the ADNI14, AMP-AD15, PPMI16, ALS TDI's ARC17 and Answer ALS18 are examples of open datasets that facilitate cross-study collaborations. However, despite these highly productive examples of best practice, their disease-specific design limits identification of shared mechanisms of neurodegeneration and potential co-existing pathologies. In addition, most data have either never been shared or have been kept behind restrictive barriers to access12. Reasons for this include a shortage of technology solutions, a range of challenging data governance rules and privacy regimes and cultural norms and misaligned incentives among researchers, research institutions, industry and research sponsors.

The GNPC was created to systematically address these challenges to large data analysis, accelerate biomarker discovery and advance the research and development of more precise treatments for neurodegenerative disease. Our goal was to generate a large proteomics resource using available samples from established cohort studies, accompanied by a harmonized clinical dataset, and to make these data available to the scientific community in a rapid and easily accessible manner. Having reached the planned point of public data release in July 2025, the GNPC has established what it thinks is the world's largest neurodegenerative disease-focused proteomics dataset for biomarker research, with 23 partners contributing more than 35,000 analyzed biosamples and approximately 250 million unique protein measurements with matched and harmonized clinical data. Here we summarize the GNPC version 1 (V1) dataset, together with key analysis vignettes. With the associated in-depth papers in this issue19,20,21, this serves as the beginning of the explorations into this dataset and its contribution to the field of neurodegenerative disease.

Traditional ‘on premises' data science analyses have become more challenging as datasets have increased in size, with a corresponding increase in resources required for moving data from one location to another. Moreover, local analysis presents a challenge in ensuring data integrity, safety and confidentiality. The GNPC's partnership with the AD Data Initiative provided the consortium with virtual access to the cloud-resident harmonized dataset with analysis workspaces via the AD Workbench22, a secure, cloud-based environment that is able to satisfy multiple different geographical data jurisdictions (for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA))23.

For GNPC V1, we opted to use SOMAmer technology (provided by SomaLogic) as the primary proteomics platform as it was one of the broadest discovery platforms available. However, we also analyzed a subset of samples with Olink and mass spectrometry methods to allow for cross-platform comparison. In general, the GNPC's approach is agnostic to platforms and is guided primarily by coverage, reproducibility and affordability. We also think that different platforms bring complementary information as they may measure different isoforms and/or posttranslational modifications of a given protein.

Developing the GNPC's large dataset required addressing several barriers to open data and data sharing. To bring together data from several countries required navigating legal regimes with different requirements, including the GDPR (Europe), the Data Protection Act (United Kingdom) and HIPAA (United States). The GNPC's legal team worked with institutions in each jurisdiction to address specific concerns and agree on a framework for data sharing that worked across the board, including collecting the data on servers physically located in Western Europe.

The first version of the harmonized data was made available to consortium members in June 2024. Analysis of the harmonized dataset is organized in four workstreams to allow members of the consortium to collaborate on areas of related interest: longitudinal profiling, cross-sectional profiling, proteogenomics and prediction modeling. Here we present the first set of analyses of the GNPC dataset, including the overarching summary analyses and, in accompanying papers, the work conducted in the GNPC workstreams during the first year of data availability.

The GNPC V1 harmonized dataset is focused on neurodegenerative diseases and, more specifically, on AD, PD, ALS, FTD and aging among 18,645 participants, drawn from 23 individual cohorts across a total of 31,083 unique peripheral plasma, serum and CSF samples, culminating in 35,056 unique proteomic assays and approximately 250 million individual protein measurements (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Most of the proteomics characterization comes from the SOMAmer-based capture array (SomaScan version 4.1, version 4 and version 3 platforms), measuring approximately 7,000 (n = 26,458), 5,000 (n = 4,528) or 1,300 (n = 95) unique aptamers per biosample, respectively. Additionally, 1,975 of the plasma samples characterized on the version 4.1 SomaScan platform had tandem mass tag mass spectrometry performed. The harmonized dataset additionally includes 40 clinical features, including demographic data, vital signs data and clinical features collected with each blood or CSF draw (Supplementary Table 3). These aggregated and harmonized data demonstrated their value to the consortium immediately, as they served to rapidly confirm signals originally identified in smaller datasets across the entirety of the GNPC V1 dataset, thereby serving as an ‘instant validation' resource24,25.

To evaluate the structure and comparability of the blood-based proteomics data, we conducted a principal component analysis on plasma and serum samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). Serum samples clustered distinctly from plasma, reflecting a clear matrix effect. Among plasma samples, a modest offset was observed between the 5K and 7K SomaScan platforms, whereas EDTA and citrate plasma samples appeared largely similar. All three vignettes described below focused exclusively on plasma proteomic data, and, where relevant, platform-related differences between 5K and 7K assays were addressed using scaling or predictive modeling approaches.

To highlight the breadth and utility of the GNPC V1 resource, we present three illustrative vignettes that showcase how this harmonized dataset can be applied to address key questions in neurodegenerative disease and aging research: (1) disease-specific differential abundance profiling, (2) biological aging across organ systems and (3) protein markers of genetic risk as exemplified by the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. As summarized below and described in more detail in the accompanying papers in this issue19,20,21, these vignettes reflect the analytical depth enabled by the GNPC and are intended to catalyze further exploration by the broader research community upon public data release.

We examined the plasma proteome as measured using the SomaLogic 7K platform, among people with AD, PD, FTD and ALS (referred to hereafter as ‘Patients', n = 3,002), and separately among people with no neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and cognitively normal test screenings (referred to hereafter as ‘Controls', n = 5,879) (see Vignette 1 methods for sample selection criteria). First, we sought to identify proteins differentially abundant in the plasma of patients with different neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive effects—namely, AD, PD, FTD and ALS. Leveraging the breadth of cohorts included in the GNPC, we first performed cohort-stratified analyses to internally validate the most robust protein changes, focusing on those consistently altered across multiple study cohorts. Cohort-stratified results were subsequently combined using a meta-analysis for AD (Fig. 1a), PD (Fig. 1b), FTD (Fig. 1c) and ALS (Fig. 1d).

a–d, Meta-analytic differential abundance analysis showing changes in relative protein expression of AD (a), PD (b), FTD (c) and ALS (d) compared to Controls. Each dot represents a protein. The x axis shows the direction and effect size of protein changes relative to Controls, from linear regression models including age and sex as covariates; the y axis shows the –log10 FDR-adjusted P value. P values from two-sided tests and after adjustment from FDR are reported. The parallel line at the bottom of each plot shows which proteins are significant after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. The line above shows proteins further surviving Bonferroni correction. Dots are colored based on the number of cohorts where the protein was found to be independently significant after (within-cohort) FDR correction and changed in the same direction relative to Controls (that is, increased or decreased compared to Controls). e–h, Significant proteins from the differential abundance analyses were fed into Reactome enrichment analysis for AD (e), PD (f), FTD (g) and ALS (h), using unique SomaScan 7K proteins as background. Enriched Reactome pathway terms for each condition are visualized as dot plots, with dot size corresponding to the number of differentially abundant proteins assigned to a given pathway (one-sided Fisherʼs test with FDR adjustments). Full Reactome enrichment summary statistics are reported in Supplementary Table 6.

In AD (n = 1,966), 27 proteins from AD Patients robustly emerged as being significantly elevated compared to Controls across at least six of the 10 different cohorts, including ACHE, SPC25, LRRN1 and CTF1. Additionally, GDF2 and APOB also showed high meta-analytic effect sizes and were independently significant in five and four separate cohorts, respectively (Fig. 1a). In contrast, 130 proteins were consistently lower in AD plasma across at least six cohorts, including VAT1, GPD1, ARPC2 and PA2G4. Furthermore, we observed significant decreases in RPS12, NPTXR and NT5C across five cohorts. These top hits highlight both expected and underexplored targets consistently altered in AD plasma across cohorts, including those with established ties to lipid metabolism (APOB and GPD1), cholinergic signaling and/or treatment response (ACHE and VAT1) and synaptic integrity (NPTXR), as well as novel targets linked to cytoskeletal regulation (ARPC2) and RNA metabolism (PA2G4 and RPS12). Follow-up analysis (see Vignette 3) also indicated that elevation of some targets, such as SPC25, LRRN1 and CTF1, reflected underlying APOE ε4 genotype effects rather than AD diagnosis per se. Reactome pathway analyses (n = 2,640, Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) revealed enrichment for terms related to sugar metabolism (‘glucose metabolism' and ‘glycolysis') and protein prenylation (‘RAB geranylgeranyltransferase'), reinforcing links to bioenergetics and vesicle trafficking (Fig. 1e).

In PD (n = 607), 40 proteins were significantly elevated across at least three of seven different cohorts, including SUMF1, PRR15, AARDC3 and RDH16, which were elevated in at least four cohorts (Fig. 1b). Additional proteins such as PSMC5, DDX1 and VSIR exhibited strong effect sizes and replicated in two cohorts. In contrast, 15 proteins were significantly lower in PD plasma across at least three cohorts, including CLEC3B, GPD1 and SEMA4G. Meta-analytic effect sizes were very high for PRSS8, BAGE3, NPS, PRL and HEXB, all of which decreased in PD but were less reproducible across contributing cohorts, suggesting cohort-specific factors driving depleted abundance of these targets. These candidate PD-associated proteins include targets associated with proteostatic (SUMF1, HEXB and PSMC5), immune (VSIR and CLEC3B) and axonal guidance (SEMA4G) pathways, possibly reflecting both peripheral and brain-related pathophysiology. Similar to in AD, Reactome pathway analyses (n = 2,251, Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) revealed enrichment for terms related to Ras superfamily/small GTPases and vesicle trafficking (‘vesicle-mediated transport' and ‘signaling by RHO GTPases'), highlighting a plasma proteome pathway overlap between AD and PD (Fig. 1f).

Although FTD clinical syndromes are less common than AD or PD and have greater clinical and neuropathological diversity, nine targets exhibited decreased abundance in FTD plasma (n = 175) across multiple cohorts after Bonferroni correction (Fig. 1c). Strongly downregulated hits included NPTXR, APLP1 and HS6ST3, which converge on processes critical for synaptic maintenance and neuronal support. Eleven proteins were significantly elevated in FTD plasma with a conventional false discovery rate (FDR) correction but did not survive Bonferroni correction. Despite limited power, Reactome pathway analyses (n = 71, FDR < 0.05) revealed two significantly enriched terms, ‘posttranslational protein phosphorylation' and ‘regulation of insulin-like growth factor transport and uptake by IGFBPs', highlighting conserved peripheral signatures of neurodegeneration even amid the clinical and pathological heterogeneity of FTD (Fig. 1g).

In ALS (n = 254), we analyzed plasma proteomic profiles from a single contributing cohort with Patients and Controls (Fig. 1d). After FDR correction, 44 targets exhibited significantly increased abundance in ALS, including a host of proteins related to skeletal muscle structure and function (PDLIM3, MYOM2, MYLPF and TNNI2). Thirty-eight targets exhibited significantly decreased abundance in ALS, including two aptamers targeting ART3, an ADP-ribosyltransferase enriched in skeletal muscle, as well as additional proteins linked to growth factor signaling and/or extracellular matrix composition (ANTXR2, CRTAC1 and RGMA). Reactome pathway analyses (n = 82, FDR < 0.05) confirmed this strong biological enrichment for skeletal muscle-related processes (‘muscle contraction' and ‘collagen chain trimerization') (Fig. 1h), underscoring a clear peripheral proteomic footprint of ALS consistent with its primary motor system pathology.

After identifying disease-related differential abundance patterns, we combined data across AD, PD and FTD to identify a global signature of dementia severity. Specifically, a 256-protein clinical impairment signature was derived using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based prediction of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global scores, which was subsequently evaluated in a held-out test set (2,047 records; 30% of the dataset). Signature values correlated with CDR global scores (train: Pearsonʼs r = 0.68; test: r = 0.58) in a stepwise fashion, increasing at each level of clinical severity (Fig. 1i; see Supplementary Table 7 for individual-level scores). To demonstrate concordance with an orthogonal clinical outcome, we observed that higher signature values were also associated with lower cognitive test scores (standardized Montreal Cognitive Assessment/Mini-Mental State Examination (MoCA/MMSE); r = −0.47), consistent with expected inverse correlations between cognition and CDR. In disease-stratified analysis combined across training and test sets, the multivariate protein signature was reliably elevated with greater clinical severity in AD (r = 0.55), FTD (r = 0.85) and PD (r = 0.70), supporting its relevance as a transdiagnostic marker of clinical severity (Fig. 1j). Top proteins with high feature importance in the clinical impairment signature (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 8) again highlighted ACHE and NPTXR as well as additional targets linked to neuroplasticity (EPHA4 and CNTFR) and immune activation (MSMP and KLK3), underscoring their potential for transdiagnostic dementia staging.

One advantage of plasma proteomics is the ability to simultaneously query the health of distinct organ systems. We applied previously validated plasma proteomic organ aging models26 to assess accelerated organ-specific aging across multiple Patient and Control data in the GNPC. Predicted organ ages showed moderate to strong correlations with chronological age (r range, 0.36–0.92; Fig. 2a), confirming model performance in the GNPC cohort26. Figure 2b shows the association between organ age gaps, which capture person-specific differences between estimated organ age and actual age, and AD, FTD and PD, respectively. Elevated cognition-enriched brain age gaps, reflecting the subset of brain-specific proteins that previously enhanced model age gap prediction of cognitive impairment, were associated with higher odds of AD (odds ratio = 1.33 per 1-s.d. age gap increase (95% confidence interval: 1.25–1.41)) and FTD (odds ratio = 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.06–1.48)). Non-cognition-enriched brain age gap was weakly associated with AD risk (odds ratio = 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.14)) but not other conditions. Beyond brain, we observed contributions of artery (odds ratio = 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.11–1.25)), liver (odds ratio = 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.17)) and intestine aging to AD (odds ratio range, 1.12–1.18) as well as a unique link between muscle aging and PD (odds ratio = 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.19)). These findings extend previous work by demonstrating shared and distinct patterns of blood-detectable accelerated organ aging across AD, FTD and PD, underscoring connections between systemic health and neurodegenerative disease that may be related as a cause, correlate or consequence.

Black dashed line indicates the LOWESS regression estimate of the population mean. Pearsonʼs correlation coefficient r is reported for each clock. b, Body plots showing associations of standardized organ age gaps with neurodegenerative disease based on binary logistic regression models. P values are from two-sided tests. Red dots indicate positive associations (higher age gap with disease); blue dots indicate negative associations (lower age gap with disease). Bold labels highlight organ ages associated with organ age gap with P < 0.05 after FDR correction. The body plots were created in BioRender: Oh, H. (2025): https://BioRender.com/afoqtwz.

Using a combination of machine learning and biological enrichment approaches, we sought to isolate the molecular signatures of APOE ε4, the main genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, independent of AD and other conditions. Several proteins, including SPC25, LRRN1, S100A13 and NEFL, were strongly associated with APOE ε4 versus other alleles (Fig. 3a), paralleling prior observations for some of these targets in serum27. Some proteins, such as SPC25 and LRRN1, showed no difference between AD and Controls but exhibited dose-dependent associations with APOE ε4 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that previously identified links to AD from Vignette 1's differential abundance analysis were driven by APOE ε4 enrichment in AD cases. Conversely, well-known AD-associated neuromodulatory proteins such as NPTXR and GDF2 were robustly associated with AD diagnosis, irrespective of APOE ε4 allelic dose (Fig. 3c).

a, Volcano plot shows the protein association profile of APOE ε4 after adjusting for AD dementia diagnosis, with red representing significant associations (after FDR correction). At the y axis, the −log10(FDR-adjusted P values) > 300 were set to 300 for better visualization. This was done for S100A13, TBCA, NEFL, LRRN1 and SPC25. b,c, Box plots show plasma protein level changes of the proteins with the strongest APOE ε4 associations (b) and for APOE ε4-associated proteins strongly tied to AD dementia diagnosis (c). For b and c, the y axis represents residual protein levels after adjusting for age, sex, mean protein level and contribution site. The center line of each box indicates the median, with lower and upper edges representing the 25th and 75th percentiles. Whiskers extend to the most extreme values within 1.5 times the interquartile range; data points beyond this range were excluded as outliers. The x axis represents AD diagnosis. The color indicates APOE ε4 carrier status; ‘−/−' indicates APOE ε4 non-carriers; ‘±' indicates ε3/ε4; and ‘+/+' indicates ε4/ε4. Welch's t-test was used to compare residual protein levels between groups. Two-sided P values are reported. ****P < 0.0001 and *P < 0.05. P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, as only prespecified group contrasts are shown. Results marked with **** remain significant (pFDR < 0.0001) even after adjustment for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini–Hochberg method, whereas those marked with * do not. d, Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) showing the performance of a machine learning model using only five proteins to predict APOE ε4 status across different diagnostic groups, in a held-out sample. e, Protein interaction network including four of those five proteins (red). f, Neural cell type expression of RNA transcripts encoding the five APOE ε4-predictive proteins.

Limma t-statistic is shown for both contrasts; only proteins associated with both APOE ε4 and AD (adjusted P < 0.05 for both analyses) with the same direction of effect are visualized. For visibility purposes, t-statistic values higher than 10 were capped. PDD, Parkinsonʼs disease dementia; pFDR, FDR-corrected P value.

Notably, the effects of APOE ε4 genotype on the plasma proteome were so robust that a machine learning model with only five proteins (SPC25, NEFL, S100A13, TBCA and LRRN1) predicted APOE ε4 carrier status in unseen patients with high accuracy, both within AD and within non-AD Patients (area under the curve (AUC) range, 0.90–0.96; Fig. 3d). Leveraging protein–protein interaction libraries and single brain cell RNA sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas28, we observed that three of these proteins (SPC25, TBCA and S100A13) were central nodes in the protein–protein interaction network (Fig. 3e) and brain cell type expression patterns (Fig. 3f)28. Ubiquitin-C, however, was found to be a key connection point across the central node proteins, suggesting potential convergence on proteostatic pathways.

Lastly, to identify potential genotype–phenotype links, we compared proteins associated with APOE ε4 in cognitively unimpaired individuals (n = 2,817; 215 proteins) to those associated with AD in APOE ε3 homozygotes (n = 1,843; 2,150 proteins). Forty-four overlapping proteins showed consistent directionality (Fig. 3g), including targets elevated in APOE ε4 and AD. Patients involved in immunovascular signaling (MMP8), synaptic vesicle fusion (SNAP23) and lipid trafficking (APOB) pathways relevant to APOE biology and cognitive decline. This overlap highlights potential early molecular footprints of AD pathophysiology present even in asymptomatic APOE ε4 carriers and underscores the utility of contextualizing by APOE genotype when seeking AD-relevant proteomic signals. These shared proteins may reflect core features of APOE-related biology that are also prominent in AD, highlighting potential mechanisms through which APOE ε4 contributes to disease vulnerability.

The availability of high-dimensional molecular datasets has led to an increasing number of large-scale collaborative programs to share and use these data—a trend forged by the genetics community. Following these data-sharing collaborations, numerous initiatives have led the way in data sharing with the wider scientific community. We would like to highlight in particular two programs focused on neurodegeneration or proteomics. The first large-scale open data-sharing program in neurodegeneration was the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): an immensely productive public–private partnership that continues today and has spawned many followers. These include AddNeuroMed/InnoMed, an ADNI-like program in Europe that served as a pilot for the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) funding scheme that itself has generated many data-sharing and sample-sharing programs, including, for example, IMI-EMIF and IMI-EPND in neurodegeneration. In the proteomics arena, the GNPC was preceded by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBB-PPP) that generated extensive protein data on 50,000 research participants and is now planning analysis on an additional 250,000 participants, to accompany the extensive clinical, imaging and genomic data available to the scientific community. The GNPC complements both initiatives and many others in providing a disease-focused dataset, as in the ADNI, but at scale, as in the UKBB-PPP.

Notably, a key point of emphasis of the GNPC's mission is the strong intent to share this dataset with the global research community early in its life cycle. We do not present these analyses as definitive but, rather, as the pilot experiments by a subset of researchers whose datasets contributed to the construction of GNPC V1. We hope this summary paper and more in-depth papers serve as an invitation of collaboration and/or independent analysis from the global community. Only then will we be able to maximize disease insights from GNPC V1 and its combination with other datasets to accelerate translation of insights into the next generation of diagnostics and therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.

The initial analyses presented here underscore the versatility and translational potential of the GNPC dataset. First, disease-specific differential abundance and disease-shared clinical severity analyses revealed both established and novel protein targets in plasma across AD, PD and FTD, highlighting shared and distinct biological processes such as vesicle trafficking, synaptic integrity and metabolic dysregulation. These results not only validate previously reported protein markers but also nominate new candidates for mechanistic follow-up and blood biomarker development—an urgent clinical need across diseases. Second, organ aging clocks applied to the GNPC dataset uncovered disease-specific patterns of accelerated aging across brain and peripheral organs, offering a systems-level view of proteomic aging that bridges central and systemic health. These findings extend previous work on biological aging by demonstrating that distinct conditions are associated with unique organ-specific age gaps, supporting their relevance to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, proteome-wide analysis of the APOE genotype revealed a robust and disease-independent APOE ε4 signature, with potential mechanistic relevance to proteostasis and lipid transport. These vignettes, each explored further in companion publications19,20,21, illustrate the range of insights made possible by GNPC V1 and set the stage for future hypothesis-driven and exploratory research by the broader scientific community, with the potential to better support trial design, monitoring and subtyping of clinical patients.

These data, as well as these vignette analyses and those in the accompanying papers, suggest that very large protein datasets have potential to add value to drug discovery. Hitherto, the value of genetic data has been increasingly recognized in supporting effective drug discovery. Notably, targets with genetic support are more likely to progress through the drug discovery pipeline29 with probability of success recently being calculated to be 2.6 times greater than in targets lacking genetic support, even for genes with small effect sizes30. In contrast to the inherited traits represented by genetic variants, proteomics represents biological states. Although genetic factors are intrinsically causal in their relationship with disease, a proteomic association with disease might be consequential of the disease, a factor associated with disease (including response to a therapeutic) or reflect a causal process. Although these observations might suggest a role for proteomics more in supporting drug discovery through biomarker discovery rather than for target identification, the vignettes reported here and in the accompanying papers illustrate the potential for more direct drug target identification/validation. For example, in Vignette 1, the proteomic profiles identified include strong support for synaptic dysfunction with proteins identified that are already clearly part of a mechanism targeted for neurodegeneration drug discovery, such as NPTXR31, whereas, in Vignette 3, proteins are identified that are very strongly associated with APOE status and with disease state. These proteins will surely now be considered as possible targets for drug discovery, especially considering that the APOE genotype is a striking example of a very strong genetic risk factor that has not been the source of equally strong drug discovery programs. The GNPC data also support target validation, an important component of target identification in driving drug discovery. Preclinical models might be used to generate signatures of targets or interventions, and, using GNPC data, these signatures now can be used to predict outcomes. In reverse, signatures or candidate protein targets identified in the GNPC could be validated in such preclinical models. Whether in conjunction with genetic data or with preclinical models, the proteomics data now being made available are likely to become a strong additional component of effective target identification and validation. As additional datasets similar to the GNPC and UKBB-PPP become available, it is possible that proteomics will become as important an element of drug discovery as genetics is today.

Despite the evident success in establishing a substantial dataset, the GNPC has some limitations. These include the relative lack of diversity, reflecting much of past observational bioresources where most research participants have been individuals of European ancestry living in the Global North. The dataset would also be enhanced with other proteomics platforms, including complementary molecular biomarker data including genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics as well as imaging and clinical data and with other disease types related to neurodegeneration. Data harmonization challenges in a post hoc meta-analysis such as the GNPC include site differences in sample processing, clinical methodologies for diagnoses and patient demographics. For example, incomplete medication information limited the ability to identify and separate definitive drug-induced changes to the proteome from disease-relevant changes and/or to correlate proteomic signatures comprehensively with amyloid and synuclein biomarkers. However, despite the cross-site heterogeneity, we were nonetheless able to identify clear and novel signals in the plasma proteome as presented in the vignettes.

The GNPC has been built to accommodate growth and aims to increase diversity in terms of patients and measurements over time. As a next step, the GNPC is poised to incorporate additional cohorts, samples and data platforms in a V2 dataset and will seek to rectify some of these limitations as we build out the collaboration. The flexibility of the platform allows for secure, iterative data releases to adapt to new discoveries made in the field. The GNPC's aspiration is to facilitate neurodegenerative disease research and development, driving advances toward better outcomes for people with neurodegenerative diseases through precision, combination therapy optimized for a patient's disease subtypes.

Proteomic profiling within the GNPC was primarily performed using the SomaScan platform (SomaLogic). Biofluid specimens were independently shipped by each contributing cohort to SomaLogic, with coordination support provided by Gates Ventures. The SomaScan platform uses slow off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers) to quantify thousands of proteins in human biofluids, including plasma, serum and CSF. Samples were analyzed within each contributing cohort using versions 3 (~1,300 targets), 4 (~5,000 targets) or 4.1 (~7,000 targets) of the SomaScan assay.

All participating cohorts confirmed that all contributed clinical and generated biosample data were in compliance with the individual patient consents prior to contributing data to the GNPC. Proteomic data from each contributing cohort were processed separately, following SomaLogic's standardized adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood (ANML) pipeline for hybridization normalization, signal calibration and quality control. These procedures adjust for systematic variation using internal reference standards and buffer controls included on each assay plate. Between-sample normalization was performed using median signal intensities and adaptive procedures to reduce batch and run-to-run variation. Samples with signal intensities that substantially deviated from expected ranges are flagged by SomaLogic for quality concerns but were not removed from the dataset. After cohort-level processing and normalization, datasets were combined to form the harmonized GNPC V1 dataset.

At the time of release, we have included 53 clinical variables across all datasets and will continue to increase this number toward a target of over 150 harmonizable variables in the next version of the harmonized dataset. The clinical variables included in this first release of data include demographic data, harmonized cognitive data from research assessments and comorbidity data (Supplementary Table 3).

To harmonize the clinical metadata across the 23 cohorts, we started with a minimum set of 13 required features that were requested from each cohort: age, gender, years of education, date of visit, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, medication use, comorbidities, vital signs, at least one psychiatric measure, at least one cognitive dementia or functional rating score, at least one cognitive test score and disease-specific genotype data. After initial data contribution, five key vital signs (height, weight, body mass index, resting heart rate and blood pressure) and 14 comorbidities (alcohol use, smoking/tobacco use, stroke, transient ischemic attack, traumatic brain injury, cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, angina, hyperlipidemia and hypertension) were identified as common features across at least five cohorts for harmonization. The 19 identified features were then identified, where available, from each of the cohort's data contributions. Demographic and biometric information was normalized to a common scale. Biologically impossible values were cleaned from the dataset. To handle outlier values in years of education, height, weight, body mass index, resting heart rate, blood pressure and total years smoked, an additional variable was created for each feature to indicate if a value was within 2 or 3 s.d. from the mean. Variables were aligned through a mapping schema, ensuring that equivalent tests and demographic categories were matched correctly.

Diagnosis information and control and cognitive impairment data were included, if provided. Diagnosis data for AD, PD, ALS and FTD were captured from the provided clinical data. Due to the variability in AD diagnosis methodology across the 23 cohorts, the method for diagnosis was provided. Using the provided diagnosis data from each site and CDR test scores, a harmonized Clinical Diagnosis variable was created categorizing each participant into one of four categories: Cognitively Normal (CN) (CDR = 0 or confirmed recruited control participant), MCI (CDR = 0.5), Dementia (CDR ≥ 1 or a confirmed diagnosis of AD or FTD) or Other Neurodegenerative Disease (a confirmed case of PD or ALS). For participants with no formal diagnosis information or CDR reported, cognitive test scores (MMSE or MoCA) were used to categorize an individual's cognitive impairment as Not Impaired (MMSE ≥ 24 and MoCA ≥ 17) or Impaired (MMSE < 24 and MoCA < 17) (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Datasets were merged using unique participant identifiers, followed by quality control checks to rectify inconsistencies. Finally, validation was performed by comparing results from the integrated dataset with original study findings.

Each of the three vignettes presented here was conducted by separate workstreams within the GNPC, each using distinct criteria and methodological frameworks tailored to their specific research questions. These analyses were intentionally designed to highlight the breadth of analytic approaches enabled by the GNPC dataset—from disease-specific differential abundance and transdiagnostic clinical severity modeling to biological aging clocks and genotype-based signatures. As such, they serve as illustrative examples rather than a unified analytic pipeline, showcasing the flexibility and depth of the GNPC V1 resource for diverse scientific inquiries.

For AD, PD, FTD and ALS, we used protein data from each participant's first available plasma sample, based on clinical data from the cohorts. To reduce diagnostic ambiguity, we excluded participants with conflicting or overlapping clinical labels. This included individuals labeled with both AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (n = 271) and those assigned two distinct neurodegenerative disease diagnoses (n = 90). We opted to include only individuals diagnosed with AD at the dementia stage, thus excluding those in prodromal stages. CN Control participants were included if they were explicitly labeled as Controls in their respective cohorts and/or had a CDR score of 0. We also removed participants missing age or sex data (n = 54). After all exclusions, the final dataset comprised 5,879 Controls, 1,966 patients with AD, 607 patients with PD, 175 patients with FTD and 254 patients with ALS (Supplementary Table 4).

Protein aptamer abundance levels (relative fluorescence units) were log2 transformed prior to analysis. Extreme outliers, defined as values more than 5 s.d. above or below the mean across the full dataset, were removed for each aptamer. To ensure biological relevance, only aptamers targeting human proteins were retained for analysis, resulting in a final analytic set of 7,289 unique aptamers (Supplementary Table 5).

Given the inherent heterogeneity across contributing GNPC cohorts, all differential abundance analyses were first conducted within each cohort. For each neurodegenerative disease, Patient samples were compared to Control samples using linear regression with the protein used as the dependent variable and disease diagnosis as the independent variable, with age and sex included as covariates. Only cohorts with at least five patients in each diagnostic category (AD, PD, FTD or ALS) were analyzed. In the few cohorts that lacked internal control samples (for example, Cohorts R and G for AD, Cohorts R and T for PD and Cohort S for ALS), patient data were compared to pooled Controls from the remaining cohorts. See Supplementary Table 3 for a breakdown of Controls and Patients across cohorts.

After estimating effect sizes within each cohort, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses to identify proteins with reproducible disease associations across cohorts, thereby providing internal replication of top signals. For each aptamer, a weighted average of effect sizes was calculated, taking into account the sample size of patients at each cohort, and meta-analytic Pvalues were computed using the weighted z-score method via the ‘metapro R' package. These Pvalues were then adjusted for multiple comparisons using both FDR and Bonferroni correction (separately). To further assess reproducibility, we calculated the number of cohorts in which each aptamer was significantly differentially abundant (FDR < 0.05) as well as the consistency of directionality (that is, the number of cohorts showing concordant upregulation or downregulation for a given target.)

Proteins identified in the meta-analytic differential abundance analysis were filtered into gene set enrichment analysis using the R libraries ‘ReactomePA' and ‘clusterProfiler'. Proteins were selected based on Bonferroni cutoffs where possible (AD and PD comparisons). For FTD and ALS, where statistical power was more limited, we applied a less stringent threshold of FDR < 0.05. Enrichment analysis was performed with the Reactome library against a background universe consisting of 6,404 unique human proteins measured on the SomaScan 7K platform.

Independent of diagnostic category, we also sought to identify a plasma proteomic signature of clinical severity across the GNPC disease continuum by leveraging the subset of Patients with global CDR scales (N = 6,187) and cognitive test scores (N = 5,969). To model the full spectrum of clinical severity, inclusion criteria were intentionally broadened to include all AD, PD and FTD Patients ranging from CDR = 0.5 to CDR = 3. CDR global scores were modeled based on a five-level ordinal stage from no impairment (CDR = 0) to severe impairment (CDR = 3). A proteome-wide association analysis for CDR global scores was conducted by age (linear and quadratic), sex, their interactions and smoking/alcohol status. Significant proteins (FDR < 0.05) were used to construct a multivariate protein signature via LASSO regression, with data split into 70% training and 30% test sets. Diagnosis-stratified models also tested the multivariate protein signature's ability to track cognitive severity across each clinical condition. To demonstrate robustness of prediction to orthogonal clinical measures, the CDR-derived protein signature was modeled as a predictor of cognitive performance using cross-walked, harmonized MoCA/MMSE scores (0–30 scale).

A series of recent studies has generated compelling evidence for the use of molecular ‘clocks' to estimate biological aging at the organismal and organ-specific level using plasma proteomics. Building upon this foundation, we applied validated organ age models to the GNPC dataset to evaluate disease-specific patterns of accelerated organ aging32.

This analysis was restricted to nine GNPC cohorts that included both Patients and CN Control participants, as control data were required to compute normative organ aging estimates. Diagnostic groups included individuals with AD (n = 1,973), FTD (n = 151) and PD (n = 334).

Protein levels from the SomaScan version 4.1 platform were normalized to match the version 4.0 reference using internal reference-based scaling methods, enabling consistent application of the organ aging models across assays.

Organ age estimates were computed for brain, liver, kidney, muscle, adipose, immune, lung, intestine, artery, pancreas and heart tissues, using established organ aging models that use proteins specific to each organ. Cognition-enriched brain age estimates were derived using the CognitionBrain model, which additionally limits the brain-specific proteins used for age estimation to only those that are important for the association of the model age gap with cognitive impairment, as determined by the Feature Importance for Biological Aging (FIBA) algorithm. Additionally, whole-organism (‘organismal') age estimates, using only proteins common across organs, and ‘conventional' age estimates, using all measured proteins regardless of tissue enrichment, were also calculated. The organ age gap was derived as the difference between predicted age and the cohort-specific locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression estimate for individuals with a normal cognitive clinical diagnosis (Supplementary Table 9). Associations between z-score normalized organ age gaps and diagnosis (AD, PD and FTD) were determined using logistic regression models, adjusting for age, sex and cohort.

The APOE ε4 allele is the leading genetic risk factor of late-onset AD, yet its high frequency in patients with AD complicates efforts to disentangle APOE from AD-related proteomic changes. To address this, we implemented a stepwise analytic framework to isolate proteomic signatures linked to APOE ε4 carriership, irrespective of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.

Participants were selected from GNPC cohorts based on strict diagnostic and cognitive performance criteria to ensure well-defined AD and Control groups. We first identified individuals labeled with an AD dementia diagnosis or recruited as Controls. Participants with multiple neurodegenerative disease diagnoses were excluded. Patients with AD dementia were required to have either MMSE < 24 or MoCA <17 and CDR ≥ 1, to ensure alignment with established diagnostic thresholds for dementia. CN participants did not meet criteria for any clinical diagnosis (for example, AD, MCI, FTD, ALS and PD) and had CDR = 0 and, at a minimum, cognitive test scores above a dementia threshold (MMSE ≥ 24 and/or MoCA ≥ 17) (Supplementary Table 10). To minimize confounding from opposing genotype effects, APOE ε2/ε4 heterozygotes were excluded from the analysis.

After applying the above criteria, a total of 3,934 participants were identified for further analysis. Among them, n = 2,357 were APOE ε4 non-carriers (ε4−) and n = 1,577 were APOE ε4 carriers (ε4+, either ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4). At baseline, 1,438 individuals were diagnosed with AD, and the remaining 2,496 were non-impaired (CN) Controls.

Consistent with differential abundance analyses (see Vignette 1 methods), log2-transformed aptamer values that deviated more than 5 s.d. from the mean were defined as outliers and excluded. Proteins associated with APOE ε4 carriers (carrier versus non-carrier) were identified using linear regression models, adjusting for AD dementia diagnosis (CN versus AD dementia diagnosis), age, sex, contributing cohort code and mean overall protein level (Supplementary Table 11). Multiple testing correction was performed using FDR adjustment (Benjamini–Hochberg method, α = 0.05). Residualized protein values were used for visualization. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test in the ‘ggpubr' R package (version 0.6.0) was used to test and mark the changes in protein residuals in the APOE ε4 carrier group and the AD dementia diagnosis group (Supplementary Table 12)33.

To identify a disease-agnostic proteomic signature of APOE ε4 allele status, a machine learning classification model was developed. Proteomic data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets, with standardization performed independently within each set. A classification and regression trees (CART) approach was applied to the data using cross-validation and fine tuning. All final metrics reported were derived from application of the model to the left-out testing dataset.

Model performance was stratified by CN and AD as well as FTD, PD and Parkinsonʼs disease dementia. First-order functional networks were built from proteins of interest identified by the CART model. In addition, brain cell subtype-specific enrichment analysis was performed using single-nuclei brain RNA sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas.

To explore proteins influenced independently by APOE ε4 carriership and AD diagnosis, two additional comparisons were performed. First, proteins associated with APOE ε4 in cognitively unimpaired individuals were identified. Second, proteins associated with AD compared to Controls were identified specifically in APOE ε3 homozygote AD patients. Analyses were performed using limma (limma_3.62.2) and adjusted for sex, age at visit and contributor code. Multiple testing correction was performed using FDR adjustment (Benjamini–Hochberg method, α = 0.05).

Catalysts featuring multiple active sites hold significant potential for CO2 photoconversion to multi-carbon products. However, multi-metal-site catalysts typically face challenges with low yields and selectivity for ethylene production, with a lack of definitive design guidelines. Here we show that Bader charge can serve as a critical descriptor for delineating the structure–activity relationship of kesterite-like nanosheets in the reduction of CO2 to ethylene. We propose the Bader-Regulate-Performance principle — apposite Bader charge can provide a moderate energy barrier for intermediate adsorption and C-C coupling simultaneously, thus promoting the performance for ethylene generation. Among the predicted multi-metal-site nanosheets, the Cu2ZnSnS4, with the appropriate Bader charge, achieves a high ethylene yield of 25.16 µmol g−1 h−1 with electron selectivity of 72.4% under visible light irradiation, surpassing those of reported photocatalysts under similar catalytic conditions. Our findings provide crucial insights into the design of efficient catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to multi-carbon products.

Photocatalytic CO2 conversion provides a promising approach to tackling the increasing carbon emissions, greenhouse effects, and energy crisis1. Among numerous products, ethylene (C2H4) stands out due to its relatively high market value, demonstrating unique advantages compared to single-carbon (C1) products2. Currently, ~75% of petrochemical products originate from C2H43. The global demand for C2H4 is estimated to surpass 150 million tons annually, with its market value exceeding 100 billion US dollars in 20204,5. The prevalent industrial process for C2H4 production involves the high-temperature steam cracking of naphtha in the temperature range of 800 °C–900 °C, resulting in substantial energy consumption and environmental repercussions6. Regrettably, only a few photocatalysts, such as AuPd/TiO2 and FeCoS2, have shown the potential for CO2 conversion into C2H4 under mild conditions7. However, these photocatalysts still grapple with challenges such as low formation rates and suboptimal selectivity for C2H4 (yield <20 µmol g−1 h−1, selectivity <60%). Therefore, developing efficient catalysts for the selective photoreduction of CO2 to C2H4 under mild conditions is imperative, aligning with the pursuit of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal compounds demonstrate notable photocatalytic CO2 activity, owing to their abundant surface-active sites and efficient charge carrier separation8,9. Concurrently, the multi-metal sites on these catalysts exert precise control over the electronic structure of the active site and the adsorption configuration of intermediates during CO2 reduction, therefore regulating the selectivity to different types of bonding products10,11. For example, Chen et al. fabricated a 2D bimetallic oxyhalide Pb0.6Bi1.4O2Cl1.4 and achieved a performance for CO2 photoreduction to methanol12. They also utilized the Ag-Cu Lewis acid-base dual sites on the surface of Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires to realize photoconversion of CO2 to methane13. Besides, multi-metal sites can also break the linear-scaling relationship and promote the generation of multi-carbon (C2+) products, like the designed Ni-V sites for ethane production14,15,16. Hence, 2D transition-metal catalysts, featuring multi-metal sites, are highly promising candidates for advancing the field of photocatalytic CO2 conversion into C2H4. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of clear design guidelines for designing multi-metal-site catalysts. It is known that CO* adsorption and C-C coupling processes are crucial for ethylene production in CO2 reduction17. However, there are two key issues that need to be addressed: (1) how does CO* adsorption specifically relate to C-C coupling? Does stronger CO* adsorption result in a lower energy barrier for C-C coupling? (2) How to simultaneously regulate CO* adsorption energy and C-C coupling energy barriers? There is still no descriptor to explain the relationship between material properties and these two important processes. Therefore, a suitable descriptor for predicting the relationship with CO* adsorption and C–C coupling processes would significantly facilitate the catalyst development in producing ethylene.

Herein, we discover that the Bader charge can serve as a descriptor to predict the performance of kesterite-like Cu2MiMjS4 (Mi = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; Mj = Ge, Sn) catalysts for CO2 reduction into ethylene. Bader charge determines the number of electrons associated with each atom by partitioning the electron density between atoms, which normally reflects electronic structure of the material and its interaction with surrounding atoms18. By analyzing the electronic structure, adsorption energy, and translation state (TS) energy barrier of C–C coupling processes, we find that both the energy for CO* adsorption and C–C coupling exhibits a linear relationship with the Bader charge of the Cu atom, but in the opposite trend. In this respect, the smallest Bader charge loss of Cu atoms results in the strongest CO* adsorption energy but also leads to the highest C–C coupling energy barrier, which contrasts with previous reports suggesting that strong CO* adsorption energy favors the C–C coupling process17. We thus propose the Bader-regulate-performance (BRP) principle, that is, a moderate Bader charge can effectively balance CO* adsorption and C–C coupling processes, optimizing them to suitable levels (neither too strong nor too weak), thereby facilitating CO2 reduction to produce C2+ products, akin to the Sabatier principle19. We further confirm that Mi and Mj atoms along with sulfur vacancies (Sv) can coordinately regulate the Bader charge of Cu atoms. We verify the theoretical predictions through experiments by synthesizing various 2D kesterite-like nanosheets, such as Cu2MnSnS4 nanosheet (CMTS), Cu2CoSnS4 nanosheet (CCTS), Cu2NiSnS4 nanosheet (CNTS), and Cu2ZnSnS4 nanosheet (CZTS). Among them, the CZTS nanosheet, predicted to have a suitable Bader charge (−0.42) in Cu atoms, achieves a C2H4 generation rate of 25.16 µmol g−1 h−1 and an electron selectivity of 72.4% under visible-light irradiation, which is superior to the previous reports (<20 µmol g−1 h−1) under similar catalytic conditions.

To explore the kesterite-like Cu2MiMjS4 nanosheets theoretically, we built stable 2D slab models according to the surface formation energy (Supplementary Fig. 1-4). Considering that anion vacancies often lead to local charge accumulation, which can stabilize the reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing catalytic activity and regulating product selectivity20, we further calculated the formation energy of surface Sv. We found that the Sv can be spontaneously generated on the surface of 2D Cu2MiMjS4 slabs (except the Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS)) with a negative Sv formation energy. We then calculated the Bader charge of the pristine and Cu2MiMjS4 slabs with sulfur vacancy (Cu2MiMjS4-Sv), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5-12. The formation energy of Sv and Bader charge of Cu atoms in the pristine Cu2MiMjS4 slabs show an inverted volcano relationship (Fig. 1a), in which the slab with Cu atoms possessing Bader charge of −0.528 (nearby the CNTS and CZTS) is more likely to form Sv theoretically. In the pursuit of C2+ products, the processes of CO* adsorption and C–C coupling are pivotal21,22. We then calculated the adsorption energy of CO* intermediates (Ead(CO*)) at various potential sites within the CZTS-Sv slab. As depicted in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 13-14, the model in which CO is adsorbed at site 3 (Cu site near the Sv) exhibits the lowest adsorption energy of −0.43 eV. This negative and strong adsorption energy signifies that CO* intermediates can spontaneously bond with the Cu sites in the CZTS-Sv slab, implying an extended residence time on the surface23.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Normally, the stronger adsorption of CO* species, in turn, provides a greater likelihood for C-C coupling. We then thoroughly analyzed the C–C coupling processes (Supplementary Figs. 15–17), including the three typical pathways: CO-CO, CO-CHO, and CO-COH. Among them, the CO-COH route with the lowest coupling energy barrier was suggested as the most likely C–C coupling pathway in our case. However, after calculating the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) TS energy barrier during the C–C coupling processes of CO* and COH* (EC-C) across the Cu2MiMjS4-Sv slabs (Supplementary Figs. 18–21), we found that both the Ead(CO*) and EC-C exhibit a linear relationship with the Bader charge of the Cu atoms near the Sv, while they show the totally opposite trend. This means that a smaller Bader charge could lead to a stronger CO* adsorption, but at the same time make C–C coupling more difficult. In contrast, a moderate Bader charge could effectively balance CO* adsorption and C–C coupling processes and optimize them to suitable levels (neither too strong nor too weak), facilitating CO2 reduction to produce C2+ products; we call this the BRP principle. Therefore, the Bader charge of Cu atoms in the Cu2MiMjS4-Sv slabs can serve as a descriptor to predict their performance for CO2 reduction to C2+ products. The ideal photocatalysts with Bader charge around 0.42 on unsaturated Cu sites in the orange circle area of Fig. 1c, like CZTS slabs, could provide moderate Ead(CO*) and EC-C simultaneously, possessing a higher potential for C2+ generation from CO2 reduction according to the BRP principle. To explore the key factors regulating the Bader charge of Cu atoms in the Cu2MiMjS4-Sv slabs, we constructed analogous theoretical models for CuS, CuZnS2, and Cu3SnS4 slabs. A distinct linear relationship is still evident, as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 22-23, where the Ead(CO*) increases incrementally with the reduction in Bader charge loss [CZTS ( | −0.42 | ) <Cu3SnS4 (|−0.47 | ) <CuS (|−0.52 | ) <CuZnS2 (|−0.54 | )]. The above theoretical results imply that Mi and Mj atoms, along with Sv, can collaboratively modulate the Bader charge of Cu atoms.

To analyze the suitability of Cu2MiMjS4-Sv nanosheets for CO2 photoreduction, we took the CZTS slab as an example to study the band structure. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. 24, the conduction band maximum (CBM) of the CZTS-Sv slab surpasses the potential required for CO2 reduction (e.g., 0.14 V for C2H4 generation), while the valence band minimum (VBM) falls below the potential for H2O oxidation (e.g., 1.23 V for O2 generation). This result suggests the capability of CZTS-Sv slab for simultaneous CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation. As a proof of concept, we evaluated the performance of CZTS-Sv slab for CO2 reduction to C2H4 in theory. The comprehensive calculations of Gibbs free energy for CO2 reduction to C2H4 were conducted to unveil the rate-determining step (RDS) and dynamic conversion processes. As depicted in Fig. 1d, the elementary step of CO2 → COOH* is identified as the RDS with Gibbs free energy of 1.52 eV, while the energy barrier for C-C coupling (CO* + COH* → CO-COH*) is as low as 0.91 eV. That means the thermodynamic energy barrier for C2H4 production is induced by the protonation of CO2 to COOH*, and the C-C coupling process is not the determining factor, while it is relatively easier to proceed on the CZTS-Sv slab.

Inspired by the above theoretical predictions, we then synthesized a series of Cu2MiMjS4-Sv (Mi = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn; Mj = Sn) nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 2a–d, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the Cu2MiMjS4-Sv nanosheets possess flake-like morphology. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images verify that CMTS-Sv, CCTS-Sv, and CZTS-Sv nanosheets possess an exposed surface along (112) direction, consistent with the predicted facet with the lowest surface formation energy (112-S) (Supplementary Fig. 25), while CNTS-Sv nanosheet shows the (111) surface due to its cubic crystallinity. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping images illustrate the homogenous distribution of Cu, Mi, Mj, and S elements. Figure 2e further confirms the nanosheet configuration of CNTS-Sv with a thickness of ~8.57 nm (around 7 unit cells). XRD patterns in Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 26 depict that the phase of CMTS-Sv, CCTS-Sv, CNTS-Sv, and CZTS-Sv nanosheets is in line with the PDF number of 51-0757, 26-0513, 26-0552, and 26-0575, respectively. In contrast, bulk CZTS refers to the standard Cu2ZnSnS4 compound that is also synthesized (Supplementary Fig. 27).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To confirm the existence of Sv within the Cu2MiMjS4-Sv nanosheets, we carried out the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 28. The ESR signal at g = 2.003 can be assigned to the presence of Sv24. The presence of Sv in the CZTS nanosheet is further validated by a 0.25 eV upshift of the S 2p peak in the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) relative to that of bulk CZTS (Fig. 2h), while the Cu 2p, Zn 2p and Sn 3 d XPS peaks in Supplementary Fig. 29-30 remain almost unchanged25. Besides, the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 31a) illustrates that the CZTS nanosheet exhibits the same characteristic peaks as the bulk, with no obvious peaks related to organic compounds, which indicates the successful synthesis of clean 2D CZTS nanosheet26. However, the CZTS nanosheet lacks distinct Raman shifts at 289, 339, and 362 cm−2 that are present in the bulk (Supplementary Fig. 31b)27. This absence suggests a poor crystallinity of the nanosheet sample due to abundant S defects28. EDS analysis of element content in Supplementary Fig. 32 directly demonstrates a reduced S proportion in the CZTS nanosheet, in which atomic percent (at.%) of S element is 34.8% in the CZTS nanosheet while 45.0% in the bulk. Furthermore, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses were performed to determine the valence and coordination environment. As depicted in Fig. 2i and the insert, compared with bulk CZTS, the Cu K-edge position of the CZTS nanosheet slightly shifts to a lower energy, which verifies a lower coordination of Cu atoms in CZTS nanosheet, further confirming the presence of the Sv29. Additionally, we analyzed the synthesis cost of CZTS nanosheet and found that the sample could be easily synthesized to more than 2 grams at a low cost using the solvothermal method (Supplementary Fig. 31c), demonstrating its scalability and cost-effectiveness (Supplementary Note 4).

The good light absorption capacity and suitable band edge position of the catalyst are the prerequisites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction30. UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig. 3a show that the CZTS-Sv nanosheet presents a much better light absorption ability than the bulk counterpart. The corresponding Tauc plots (insert image in Fig. 3a) suggest the band gaps of 1.81 eV and 1.48 eV for the CZTS-Sv nanosheet and bulk, respectively. Supplementary Fig. 33 also illustrates that CMTS-Sv, CCTS-Sv, and CNTS-Sv nanosheets possess a suitable band gap (CMTS-Sv: 1.60 eV; CCTS-Sv: 1.84 eV; CNTS-Sv: 1.71 eV) for CO2 reduction with a good absorption ability for visible light. Combined with the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 34), we identify the band structure of the CZTS-Sv nanosheet. As shown in Fig. 3c, the experimental CBM (−0.19 V) and VBM (1.62 V) are well consistent with the above theoretical values (−0.16 V for CBM and 1.64 V for VBM), which confirm the ability of CZTS-Sv nanosheet for CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation simultaneously.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To evaluate the performance of the obtained Cu2MiMjS4-Sv nanosheets, visible light-driven CO2 reduction experiments were carried out under ambient conditions (Supplementary Fig. 35a, b). The circulating cooling water was used to keep the system temperature at around 21 °C according to the in situ thermographic photographs (Supplementary Fig. 35c–f). Xe lamp with VISREF (350–780 nm) reflector, AM 1.5 G filter and 400 nm cutoff filter was used to simulate the visible light source. The corresponding light spectrum is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 36. The instrument was initially evacuated three times, and, afterward, pumped by high-purity CO2 to reach atmospheric pressure. The gas and liquid products were detected by gas chromatography (GC) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, respectively. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 37-38, GC confirms that the gas products include H2, CO, CH4, and C2H4, while O2 is detected as the oxidation product. According to the calibration curves in Supplementary Fig. 39, the corresponding yield of CO, CH4, and C2H4 over CZTS-Sv nanosheet is calculated to be 0.10, 14.33 and 25.16 µmol g−1 h−1 (0.001, 0.1433 and 0.2516 µmol h−1), respectively (Fig. 3d). The turnover number of CZTS-Sv nanosheet for C2H4 production in 12 h is 5.64. CMTS, CCTS, and CNTS nanosheets also exhibit considerable performance for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction to ethylene (Supplementary Fig. 40), with the generation rate of 20.80, 9.05, and 10.18 µmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Experimental results reveal that CZTS and CMTS nanosheets yield higher C2H4 production, while CCTS shows the lowest activity, consistent with theoretical predictions (Fig. 1c). This is attributed to the moderate CO* adsorption energies and C–C coupling barriers of CZTS and CMTS, which favor C2+ product formation. In contrast, the strong CO* binding on CCTS could increase the CO* coverage but leads to a higher C-C coupling energy barrier, limiting its C2+ activity. The 1H NMR spectrum in Supplementary Figs. 38 and 41 imply that no liquid product is generated for all the synthesized Cu2MiMjS4-Sv nanosheets during the CO2 reduction. As a comparison, the performance of bulk CZTS was evaluated, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 42. Only traces of CH4 (0.89 µmol g−1 h−1) and CO (0.21 µmol g−1 h−1) were detected during the catalysis. It is notable that the generation rate of O2 from water splitting is around 93.64 µmol g−1 h−1 (Supplementary Fig. 43) when using the CZTS-Sv nanosheet as the catalyst, confirming that the number of electrons and holes consumed during the catalysis has basically reached a balance. Compared with the previously reported catalysts31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42, like FeCoS2 and Cu-ACS/PCN, the CZTS-Sv nanosheet achieves a higher yield for C2H4 evolution under the same reaction condition. The calculated electron and product selectivity of the C2H4 over the CZTS-Sv nanosheet is 72.4% and 63.6%, respectively, both of which outperform most reports under visible light irradiation (Fig. 3e). The corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO2 conversion was obtained by evaluating the performance of the CZTS-Sv nanosheet under various monochromatic light source, including 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700 nm. As shown in Fig. 3h, the most AQE is calculated to be 0.095% under 450 nm light irradiation. Their changing trends with wavelength are consistent with the light absorption spectrum (Fig. 3a).

The isotope-labeled H218O mass spectrometry was conducted to explore the generation of oxygen, in which the signals were obtained at hν = 14.0 eV. As shown in Fig. 3f, 18O2 species were detected, confirming the oxygen production from water oxidation. The isotope-labeled 13CO2 mass spectrometry was further performed to unveil the source of the C-based products. The photon energy of 13.0 eV was selected for distinguishing the gas products of 13CH4 and 13C2H4, while the signals of 13CO, O2, and 13CO2 were collected at hν = 14.2 eV according to their absolute photoionization cross sections in Supplementary Fig. 44. As a result, only 13CO, 13CH4, and 13C2H4 species were detected after using the isotope-labeled 13CO2 as reactants (Fig. 3g), implying that the C-based products indeed originated from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Several controlled experiments, e.g., under an N2 atmosphere, in the dark, and without a catalyst, showed almost no product during the catalysis, indicating that light, CO2 reactant, and CZTS-Sv nanosheet catalyst are all necessary for effective CO2 reduction to C2H4. To assess the durability of the CZTS-Sv nanosheet during the photocatalysis, the cycle stability tests were carried out. As illustrated in Fig. 3i, the yield of each product only shows a minor decrease after eight cycles. The good stability of the catalysts was further confirmed by the XRD patterns, TEM images and EDS mapping images as the morphology and crystal structure for the CZTS-Sv nanosheet remained unchanged before and after eight continuous photocatalysis of a total of 96 h (Supplementary Fig. 45). To further analyze whether the samples would be oxidized by the in-situ generated O2 during photocatalysis, we measured the oxygen content on the surface of the samples at different reaction times by TEM EDS mapping. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 46–48, the O content on the CZTS-Sv nanosheet barely increases with the reaction time, confirming its good antioxidant properties.

To gain mechanistic insights into the processes of CO2 conversion to C2H4 over the CZTS-Sv nanosheet, the dynamic exploration of charge carriers and the corresponding in situ characterizations were performed. The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 4a) and the time-resolved fluorescence spectra (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 49a) illustrate that the CZTS-Sv nanosheet has a lower PL peak intensity and a longer carrier lifetime of 263 ps relative to the bulk counterpart (103 ps), indicating their better separation ability for the excited charge carriers. Meanwhile, the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Supplementary Fig. 49b) and photocurrent density curves (Fig. 4c) demonstrate that the CZTS-Sv nanosheet possesses much smaller resistance for charge carrier transport, resulting in higher photocurrent density. In addition, compared with CZTS bulk (<1 m2 g−1), the CZTS-Sv nanosheet has higher specific surface area (36 m2 g−1) according to the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) plots in Supplementary Fig. 50, which is beneficial for CO2 adsorption, as further confirmed by the CO2 adsorption isotherms in Fig. 4d. Besides, to verify the better adsorption ability of CZTS-Sv nanosheet for reaction intermediates during the CO2 photoconversion, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectra for CO gas were performed (Fig. 4e). The desorption peaks at around 198 °C in both CZTS bulk and nanosheets could be ascribed to the CO adsorption at the saturated Cu sites. It is worth noting that there is another desorption peak at around 229 °C for the CZTS-Sv nanosheet, which could be attributed to their stronger adsorption capacity for CO at low-coordination Cu atoms near the S defects in the nanosheets, consistent with the theoretical calculations in Supplementary Fig. 51.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Next, we carried out in situ FTIR measurements to detect the reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction processes for the CZTS-Sv nanosheet (Fig. 4f). With the reaction time increasing from 0 to 20 min, a series of new infrared peaks at around 1641 cm−1 were detected, which are attributed to the COOH* group, a crucial initial intermediate for CO2 reduction37. The absorption bands near 1008 and 1106 cm−1 belong to the CH3O* group, and the peaks at 1041 cm−1 are assigned to the characteristic bands of CHO*; both the CH3O* and CHO* groups are pivotal intermediates for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbon43,44,45.

Moreover, the peaks at 2104 cm−1 can be assigned to the adsorbed CO* species46,47, indicating that the CZTS-Sv nanosheets exhibit strong adsorption for CO* intermediates. The peaks at 1193 and 1547 cm−1 belong to the adsorbed CO-COH*48, consistent with the simulated reaction pathway for C2H4 generation. Besides, the peaks located at 1697 cm−1 are attributed to the C2H4* group, providing direct evidence for the existence of C2H4 from the CO2 conversion49; and the peaks at 1223 cm−1 are inferred to be the asymmetric stretching of the HCO3* group50. As suggested by the detected reaction intermediates, the potential reaction pathway for CO2 reduction to C2H4 over the CZTS-Sv nanosheet can be inferred as follows:

In addition to the CO2 reduction reaction, it is important to recognize that the half-reaction of water oxidation also plays a pivotal role in determining the overall conversion efficiency in photocatalysis. Unfortunately, this aspect has often been overlooked in previous reports51. Here, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) simulations to explore the possible active sites and reaction mechanisms for H2O oxidation over the CZTS-Sv slab. As shown in Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 52-54, the calculated adsorption energies of H2O, H, and OH species illustrate that the H2O and OH radicals prefer to bond with Zn atoms near the S defect while the H species are easily adsorbed on the neighboring S atoms, which implies that Zn and S atoms can serve as the active sites for water splitting and H* adsorption storage respectively. To delve deeper into the intricate process of water splitting, CI-NEB TS was carried out as shown in Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 55. The resulting energy barrier for the transition state (H2O → OH* + H*) was calculated to be 1.38 eV, significantly lower than the TS energy barrier of the rate-determining step in CO2 reduction (1.695 eV for CO2 → COOH* as shown in Supplementary Fig. 56). This observation suggests that the milder water-splitting process over the CZTS-Sv slab does not significantly limit the overall efficiency of CO2 and H2O full splitting.

Combing the theoretical analysis and experimental characterizations, the potential reaction active sites and pathway are proposed as shown in Fig. 4i: CO2 molecule is first activated and reduced to CO* species by COOH* intermediates, while the low-coordination Cu atom pairs can promote the adsorption of CO species and further the C–C coupling process. Moreover, the accelerated water splitting processes by Zn and S sites provide more protons for the production of higher-order hydrocarbons.

In summary, we have demonstrated that both the energy of CO* adsorption and C-C coupling exhibited a linear relationship with the Bader charge of the low-coordination Cu atoms in multi-site Cu2MiMjS4 (Mi = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; Mj = Ge, Sn) nanosheets. The Bader charge can serve as a descriptor to predict the performance of Cu2MiMjS4 for CO2 reduction to C2H4, in which we proposed the BRP principle—apposite Bader charge could provide moderate energy barrier for intermediate adsorption and C–C coupling simultaneously, thus promoting the performance for C2H4 generation. Experimentally, our designed and synthesized multi-site Cu2MiMjS4-Sv (Mi = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn; Mj = Sn) nanosheets, all of which exhibited an activity for CO2 photoreduction to ethylene. Especially, the CZTS-Sv nanosheet, possessing the most suitable Bader charge among the Cu2MiSnS4-Sv nanosheets according to the theoretical prediction, achieved a yield of 25.16 µmol g−1 h−1 for C2H4 generation with the electron selectivity of 72.4%, in which the system could be stably operated over 96 h under visible light irradiation. As exemplified by the CZTS-Sv nanosheet, we found that the functionally segregated active sites of Cu, Zn, Sn, and S are responsible for CO2 reduction, H2O dissociation, H* adsorption storage and transport, respectively, resulting in a mild energy barrier for CO2 conversion to C2H4. In situ characterizations were further performed to monitor the reaction processes, providing a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism. We believe that this multi-metal regulation approach and BRP principle can be extended to other alloy compounds and also applied to other catalytic reactions, such as the nitrogen reduction reaction and oxygen reduction reaction.

Deionized (DI) water with the resistivity of 18.2 MΩ.cm is obtained by the ultra-pure water system from Stakpure GmbH, Germany.

128 mg Cu powder, 66 mg Zn powder, 112 mg Sn powder, and 128 mg S powder was added into the quartz seal tube. The tube was vacuumed and refilled by Ar for three times. Afterwards, the tube is putted into the high-temperature muffle furnace. Cu2ZnSnS4 bulk is obtained after calcination at 450 °C for 48 h with the heating rate of 5 °C/min.

91 mg copper acetate monohydrate, 55 mg zinc acetate dehydrate, 88 mg tin chloride pentahydrate, and 80 mg thioacetamide were added into 40 mL ethylene glycol. Afterwards, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Tefon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 180 °C for 24 h, and allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The final product was collected by centrifuging the mixture, washed with ethanol and DI water for several times until the organic residuals were completely removed, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The powder was obtained for further usage.

68 mg copper chloride, 62.8 mg manganese nitrate tetrahydrate, and 56 mg tin chloride pentahydrate were added into 40 mL ethylene glycol. After vigorously stirring for 30 min, 70 mg thiourea, and 160 mg PVP were added into the above solution and stirring for another 30 min.

XRD patterns were obtained from a Philips X'Pert Pro Super diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). TEM and HRTEM images were performed with a JEOL Jem F-200C TEM with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. XPS spectra were acquired on an ESCALAB MKII system with Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the excitation source. The binding energies obtained in the XPS spectral analysis were corrected for specimen charging by referencing C 1 s to 284.8 eV. In-situ FTIR spectra were obtained by using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50. UPS was performed at the Catalysis and Surface Science Endstation at the BL11U beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The workfunction (WF) was determined by the difference between the photon energy and the binding energy of the secondary cutoff edge. To be exact, EB = hν − (EK + 4.3 – 5.0) and WF = hν − (Ecutoff − EF) (EB, binding energy; hν, photon energy; EK, kinetic energy; Ecutoff, secondary cutoff edge; EF, Fermi level; photon energy of 40.0 eV and a sample bias of -5 V applied to observe the secondary electron cutoff). Fluorescence emission decay spectra were recorded with a DeltaFlex-NL (HORIBA Scientific) spectrometer. BET isotherms were conducted by 3 Flex Multiport Surface Characterization Analyzer from Micromeritics. Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2720 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) were used to conduct TPD of the samples. Room-temperature ESR spectra were measured on an ESR spectrometer (JEOL JES-FA200) at 300 K and 9.062 GHz. Room-temperature PL spectra were acquired on a luminescence spectrometer (Jobin Yvon Fluorolog 3-TAU, Jobin Yvon Instruments), in which the excitation pulse was generated by a 450 W Xe lamp. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed at P65 beamline at the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). XAS data were collected in the transmission mode at room temperature. The incident, transmitted, and reference X-ray intensities were monitored using gas ionization chambers. A Copper foil standard served as a reference for energy calibration and was concurrently measured with the experimental samples. Prior to measurement, all powder samples were prepared as pellets (diameter: 8 mm), diluted with an appropriate quantity of cellulose, and sealed in Kapton tape. The collected XANES and EXAFS data were further integrated and corrected using Athena software (version 0.9.26).

All FTIR spectra were recorded on Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50. The spectra were displayed in transmission units and acquired with a resolution of 4 cm−1, using 64 scans. The dome of the reaction cell had two KBr windows allowing IR transmission and a third window allowing transmission of irradiation introduced through a liquid light guide that connects to the same IR-light lamp. The catalysts were first added to the reaction cell and then trace amounts of water were sprayed on the surface of catalysts. After degassed in the Ar atmosphere for 20 min, the gas flow was switched to high-purity and wet CO2 until the adsorption was saturated, then the reaction cell was sealed. Next, the FTIR spectra were recorded as a function of time to investigate the dynamics of the reactant adsorption in the dark and desorption/conversion under irradiation30.

For powder catalysts, we used the same method to assess their performance with the previous report30. Before performing the CO2 photoreduction performance, we fabricated the sample into a thin film: the sample was dispersed in DI water to gain a concentration of about 5 mg mL−1, and then, through spin-dropping 2 mL of the above dispersion on a quartz glass, followed by heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min, the catalysts thin film could be achieved. During the CO2 photocatalytic process, a MC-PF-300C Xe lamp with VISREF (350–780 nm), AM 1.5 G filter and 400 nm cutoff filter was used to simulate visible light, the corresponding illumination spectrum of which in comparison with sunlight is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 24. Note that the distance from the lamp to the sample was ~10 cm, and the irradiation area of sample is around 7.07 cm2 with an output light density of ~50 mW cm−2. The instrument was initially evacuated three times, afterwards, pumped by high-purity CO2 to reach atmospheric pressure. To exclude the heating effect, the homothermal condensate water was used to enable the catalysts to retain a constant temperature of 290 ± 0.2 K. The gas products were quantified by the Agilent GC-8860 gas chromatograph equipped with TDX-01 column, TCD and flame ionization detector (FID) while ultrahigh-purity argon was used as a carrier gas (FID detector for carbon-based products and TCD detector for H2). For O2 detection, Porapak Q 80/100 SS column was used for gaseous oxygen molecules and the dissolved oxygen and other oxidation products were not taken into account. The liquid products were quantified by NMR (Bruker AVANCE AV III 400) spectroscopy, in which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, 99.99%) was used as the internal standard.

The product selectivity and electron selectivity for CO2 reduction to ethane has been calculated using the following equation:

where n(CO), n(CH4) and n(C2H4) are the amounts of produced CO, CH4 and C2H4.

Photocurrent and EIS were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments, Shanghai, China). Specifically, 10 mg of catalysts were dispersed in a mixture containing 950 µL ethanol and 50 µL Nafion solution, then ultrasonic treated to form homogenous catalyst ink. Then the catalyst ink was dipped on a polished FTO glass and dried in air. The photocurrent measurements were conducted in a three-electrode cell system under irradiation of the same light source as that during visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. The FTO glass (2.5 × 1.5 cm2) deposited with materials was used as the photoelectrode, a Pt foil was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. The three electrodes were inserted in a quartz cell filled with 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The Na2SO4 electrolyte was purged with CO2 for 1 h prior to the measurements. EIS was measured in the frequency of 1–1000 kHz30.

The wavelength dependent AQE of CZTS-Sv nanosheet for CO2 reduction reaction is defined by the ratio of the effective electrons used for CO2 conversion to the total input photons of different monochromatic light source. Six different light filters of 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700 nm were used to obtain the monochromatic wavelengths (square bandgaps filter with a center wavelength range of ±10 nm). The incident light intensity was determined using a Silicon-UV enhanced actinometer. After 12 h of CO2 reduction, the AQE was estimated from the following equation:

where Y(n) is the yield of different products, including carbon monoxide, methane and ethylene, e(n) is the required electron number for each product, N is Avogadro's number, P is the power of the incident monochromatic light, I is the incident photon number, S is the illumination area, λ refers to the wavelength, t is the irradiation time, h corresponds to the Planck constant, c stands for the speed of light.

The following calculation example is based on the data from CO2 photoreduction with CZTS-Sv nanosheets under monochromatic light of 450 nm wavelength for 12 h:

Y(CO) is trace (~ 0), Y(CH4, C2H4) = 4.2 × 10−7 mol, 9 × 10−7 mol; e(CO, CH4, C2H4) = 2, 8, 12; N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1; T = 12 h, S = 7.07 cm2; the power of the incident 450 nm monochromatic light: 13 mW cm−2.

DFT calculations were carried out on a Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package52. The exchange-correlation potential was described by the generalized gradient approximation within the framework of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional53. DFT-D3 method was employed to calculate the van der Waals (vdW) interaction54. The parameters of dipole correction were applied for the calculation of slab models. Electronic energies were computed with the tolerance of 1 × 10−5 eV and total force of 0.01 eV/Å. A kinetic cutoff energy of 450 eV was adopted. The optimized crystal lattice parameters of CZTS bulk (space group (I-42m (121))) are as follows: a = b = 5.4348 Å, c = 10.9589 Å (α = β = γ = 90◦). A Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh of 5 × 5 × 3 k-points were used in the structural relaxation for the bulk. The Cu2ZnSnS4 slabs were modeled by the corresponding exposed surface along (001), (100), and (112) direction with the thickness of one unit cells, in which two bottom atoms are fixed to simulate the bulk structure. A Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh of 4 × 2 × 1 k-points were used in the structural relaxation for slab models. A vacuum space of 15 Å was inserted in z direction to avoid interactions between periodic images. (More details see Supplementary Notes).

The surface energy Es is the energy required to cleave a surface from the corresponding bulk crystal. It can be given by

where A is the area of the surface on the slab models, Es(unrelax) and Es(unrelax) represent the energy of the unrelaxed and relaxed surface slab models, respectively. N is the number of in the slab and Eb is the energy of each atom in the bulk counterpart30.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are carried out within the canonical (NVT) ensemble at 300 K with the time step of 3 fs, in which at least 10 ps is used to allow the structure to relax and reach the relative equilibrium state.

Adsorption energies Eadsorption are given with reference to the isolated surface Esurface relaxed upon removing the molecule from the unit cell using identical computational parameters and the energy of the molecule Emolecule30.

The computational hydrogen electrode55 model was used to calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of CO2 reduction reaction steps:

where EDFT is the electronic energy calculated for specified geometrical structures, EZPE is the zero-point energy, S is the entropy, h is the Planck constant, ν is the computed vibrational frequencies, Θ is the characteristic temperature of vibration, k is the Boltzmann constant, and R is the molar gas constant. For adsorbates, all 3 N degrees of freedom were treated as frustrated harmonic vibrations with negligible contributions from the catalysts' surfaces30.

The CI-NEB method is used to evaluate the energy barriers of transition states during C–C coupling and H2O dissociation56,57. The image dependent pair potential method was used for improved interpolation of NEB initial guess58. The C–C coupling and H2O dissociation processes can be represented by

For the theoretical energy band structure, the screened hybrid functional proposed by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof59 was adopted to precisely calculate the DOS, from which band gap of CZTS can be obtained. The surface electrostatic potential is also computed to gain the work functions. Combining the DOS and work function, we can illustrate their band structure in theory.

Keith Krehbiel lived with Parkinson's disease for nearly 25 years before agreeing to try a brain implant that might alleviate his symptoms. He had long been reluctant to submit to the surgery. “It was a big move,” he says. But by 2020, his symptoms had become so severe that he grudgingly agreed to go ahead.

Deep-brain stimulation involves inserting thin wires through two small holes in the skull into a region of the brain associated with movement. The hope is that by delivering electrical pulses to the region, the implant can normalize aberrant brain activity and reduce symptoms. Since the devices were first approved almost three decades ago, some 200,000 people have had them fitted to help calm the tremors and rigidity caused by Parkinson's disease. But about 40,000 of those who received devices made after 2020 got them with a special feature that has largely not yet been turned on. The devices can read brain waves and then adapt and tailor the rhythm of their output, in much the same way as a pacemaker monitors and corrects the heart's electrical rhythms, says Helen Bronte-Stewart, a neurologist at Stanford University in California.

Bronte-Stewart received approval to start a clinical trial of this new technology, known as adaptive deep-brain stimulation (aDBS), the same week that Krehbiel was preparing for surgery. He recalls the phone call in which she asked him if he wanted to be her first participant: “I said, ‘Boy, do I!'”

Brain drugs can now cross the once impenetrable blood–brain barrier

Five years on, the results of this 68-person trial, called ADAPT-PD, are under review for publication. Although the exact details are still under wraps, they were convincing enough to earn approval for the technology earlier this year from both US and European regulators.

The results of this study could be a boon for the estimated one million people in the United States and 1.2 million people in Europe who now live with Parkinson's disease — and for Medtronic, the health-care technology company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that manufactures the implants. The seeming success also clears a path for other companies around the world that are racing for approval on advanced devices, says Martijn Beudel, a neurologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center who worked on the trial.

The approaching wave of therapies promises to level up DBS for Parkinson's and other motor conditions. The technology might even help to treat neurological disorders such as Tourette's syndrome and psychiatric conditions, including obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. Several clinicians suggest that the new technology could have even more profound health implications — that is, if funding for US brain-implant research isn't cut.

Since DBS was first approved in Europe and the United States in the late-1990s, the vast majority of devices have been given to people with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's is a progressive disorder, typified by the death of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is key to controlling movements.

Existing drugs that aim to increase dopamine levels can only manage the symptoms. They can't match the constant dopamine production of a healthy brain. “No matter how clever we are with it, we have never been able to exactly mimic the way the brain supplies it,” says Bronte-Stewart. This means that symptoms vary throughout the day — from the unwanted involuntary movements induced by the morning flood of dopamine-mimicking drugs to increased rigidity later in the day as the drugs wear off. The medication also comes with other side effects that vary from person to person. For Krehbiel, it was nausea so severe he had to lie down multiple times a day.

When these become overwhelming, a neurologist might recommend DBS. Implants typically dispense pulses of electrical energy deep into the brain 24 hours a day to regulate aberrant brain signals associated with uncontrollable body movements. Before this year, this always-on approach was the only commercially available form of the therapy.

But continuous DBS can sometimes amplify the drugs' effects — or generate new symptoms. Some of these are harmless: one man with OCD developed a passion for the music of Johnny Cash when his stimulator was turned on, but was uninterested in the artist when it was off1. Other symptoms are cause for more concern, including sudden-onset gambling disorders and other temporary changes in impulse control. More frequently, the addition of stimulation can induce speech impairments, such as slurring, raise the risk of falling and cause some involuntary movements.

A clinician can try to balance the system by adjusting the intensity of stimulation, but there are limits to how precisely it can be calibrated.

Krehbiel was aware of these shortcomings, and it contributed to his sense that DBS was a treatment of last resort. In the late 2010s, his neurologist hinted that big improvements were on the way. “So I thought, wait for the new technology.”

Brain-wave activity is different in people with and without Parkinson's disease. In people with Parkinson's, there are noticeable differences at one range of frequencies, known as β-oscillations (between about 13 and 30 hertz), in a region deep in the brain called the basal ganglia. This region processes sensorimotor, cognitive and mood information.

‘Big leap' for Parkinson's treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials

β-oscillations have become an important marker of motor state. In the early 2000s, researchers at University College London found increasing evidence that people with Parkinson's have intense bursts of activity in this range2. When drug treatments are working, these bursts are less exaggerated. The same is true for DBS3. The more that stimulation normalizes β-oscillations, the better the relief of some symptoms, says Bronte-Stewart.

Aberrant oscillations were dubbed oscillopathies, and in the 2000s, Medtronic started focusing on developing a device that could both read and correct these rhythms, says Tim Denison, a biomedical engineer at the University of Oxford, UK, who was working at the company at the time. “Just like you can build a radio to tune in to an audio channel, can we build a circuit that will tune in to these oscillopathies and help to guide how to adjust the stimulator?” he asks.

By 2006, Denison and his colleagues had built a ‘brain radio', a sensing chip that could tune in to the different frequency bands in which the electrode sits. The next challenge was finding out how changes in particular bands correspond to specific movement problems. That was “a huge part of the first eight to ten years of the research with the investigational hardware”, says Bronte-Stewart. She and other researchers, including Philip Starr at the University of California, San Francisco, used a succession of new prototype devices to map these oscillopathies and adjust to them.

For example, when β-oscillation intensity begins to dip after a dose of medication, aDBS automatically reduces stimulation, keeping β-power in a healthy range. As the medication wears off, it does the opposite (see ‘Fine-tuned stimulation'). In 2019, Bronte-Stewart developed one of the algorithms that would underpin aDBS. When she tested it on 13 people with Parkinson's, it improved the halting movements, called bradykinesia, that are associated with the disease4. It also helped to reduce the inability to take steps, known as freezing of gait, in a study last year5. In a separate study, Starr found that aDBS shortened the duration of volunteers' most bothersome motor disturbances, but without aggravating side effects6.

Other studies have suggested that aDBS reduces speech problems, such as slurring, that were another possible side effect of continuous DBS7,8. “It only suppressed the pathological brain activity,” without suppressing normal speech, says Beudel.

Since 2013, small trials such as these have demonstrated these effects in around 400 people, estimates Robert Raike, the director of neuromodulation research and technology at Medtronic. What was missing was a way to validate these findings in real-world settings: in people's homes and workplaces over a long period of time. Researchers needed a big trial.

Any Medtronic DBS implant manufactured after 2020 has the ability to be switched into adaptive stimulation mode. If people were enrolled in a clinical trial after 2020, their implant's experimental capabilities could be activated by a firmware update, “a software unlock, like your iPhone”, says Raike. This approach opened up a large pool of possible trial participants. And the capability could be turned back off at the end of the trial.

After two months with continuous DBS, Bronte-Stewart unlocked Krehbiel's device. It continued to keep his tremor at bay. He needed fewer drugs.

Other trial volunteers have reported similar improvements, along with a reduction of symptoms associated with continuous stimulation. Although she is not permitted to discuss the results, which are still pending publication, Bronte-Stewart points to data presented at a 2024 conference9. Of 45 volunteers in the trial who were given the choice to revert to the continuous DBS or to retain the new adaptive functionality for a further long-term follow-up, 44 chose to stay on aDBS, Krehbiel among them. “I would not have considered for more than 30 seconds reverting back,” he says. “I was feeling good and didn't much care why.”

Beudel saw a broadly similar trend among his participants. “It's no secret that the results were positive,” he says. “We now see patients from all over the country coming to our centre saying that they want the aDBS.”

Since the new system was approved earlier this year, the upgrade has been available to anyone with one of the post-2020 devices. Beyond straightforward symptom relief, these users might see beneficial effects that go beyond controlling motor symptoms.

For example, Parkinson's disease notoriously interferes with sleep, and as the medicine wears off at night, problems emerge that range from insomnia to hallucinations. Sleep deprivation, in turn, worsens the symptoms. “It is a vicious circle,” says Beudel.

Adaptive DBS could reduce sleep disturbances by automatically adjusting to the sleep-induced changes in β-oscillations.

And better sleep might, in turn, protect the brain. If it does, says Denison, aDBS could shed light on the tantalizing but controversial hypothesis that DBS protects the brain when implanted earlier in Parkinson's disease progression.

Physicists have detected the biggest ever merger of colliding black holes. The discovery has major implications for researchers' understanding of how such bodies grow in the Universe.

“It's super exciting,” says Priyamvada Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved in the research. The merger was between black holes with masses too big for physicists to easily explain. “We're seeing these forbidden high-mass black holes,” she says.

The discovery was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a facility involving two detectors in the United States. It comes at a time when US funding for gravitational-wave detection faces devastating cuts. The results, released as a preprint on the arXiv server1, were presented at the GR-Amaldi gravitational-waves meeting in Glasgow, UK, on 14 July.

LIGO detects gravitational waves by firing lasers down long, L-shaped arms. Minuscule changes in arm length reveal the passage of gravitational waves through the planet. The waves are ripples in space-time, caused by massive bodies accelerating, such as when two inspiralling black holes or neutron stars merge.

Hundreds of these mergers have been observed using gravitational waves since LIGO's first detection in 2015. But this latest detection, made in November 2023, is the biggest yet. By modelling the signal detected by LIGO, scientists have calculated that the event, dubbed GW231123, was caused by two black holes with masses of about 100 and 140 times that of the Sun merging to form a final black hole weighing in at some 225 solar masses.

“It's the most massive [merger] so far,” says Mark Hannam, a physicist at Cardiff University, UK, and part of the LVK Collaboration, a wider network of gravitational-wave detectors that encompasses LIGO, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. It's “about 50% more than the previous record holder”, he says.

Most of the events captured by LIGO involve stellar-mass black holes — those ranging from a few to 100 times the mass of the Sun — which are thought to form when massive stars end their lives as supernovae. However, the two black holes involved in GW231123 fall in or near a predicted range, of 60–130 solar masses, at which this process isn't expected to work, with theories instead predicting that the stars should be blown apart. “So they probably didn't form by this normal mechanism,” says Hannam.

Instead, the two black holes probably formed from earlier merger events — hierarchical mergers of massive bodies that led to the event detected by LIGO, which is estimated to have happened 0.7 billion to 4.1 billion parsecs (2.3 billion to 13.4 billion light years) away.

It's like “four grandparents merging into two parents merging into one baby black hole”, says Alan Weinstein, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and also part of the LVK Collaboration.

‘It's a dream': JWST spies more black holes than astronomers predicted

Models of the black holes also suggest that they were spinning exceedingly fast — about 40 times per second, which is near the limit of what Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts black holes can reach while remaining stable. “They're spinning very close to the maximal spin allowable,” says Weinstein.

Both the spin and the mass could provide clues to how black holes grow. One of the biggest questions in astronomy is how the largest black holes, the supermassive ones found at the centres of galaxies such as the Milky Way, grew in the early cosmos.

Although there is plenty of evidence for the existence of stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes — those of more than a million solar masses — intermediate-mass black holes in the range of 100 to 100,000 solar masses have been harder to find. “We don't see them,” says Natarajan.

Almost 60 million people globally have neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.Credit: Mark & Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute/Science Photo Library

A gene variant known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease also makes people vulnerable to a host of other age-related brain disorders, from Parkinson's disease to motor neuron disease. The gene variant, a version of apolipoprotein E called APOE ε4, produces a distinct set of proteins that contribute to chronic inflammation, finds an analysis1 using the largest proteomics database for neurodegenerative disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases affect more than 57 million people worldwide. Researchers know that people who carry the APOE ε4 variant have an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but studies are beginning to implicate this version, or allele, of APOE in other neurodegenerative diseases. 

Caitlin Finney and Artur Shvetcov, who study neurodegenerative diseases at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, Australia, and their colleagues wanted to better understand how this genetic risk factor contributes to disease. They took advantage of a newly established proteomics database that allowed them to look beyond individual diseases, says Finney.

The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC) data set2 includes samples from more than 18,600 individuals, mainly of European ancestry, including many with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, a form of motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and types of dementia, as well as individuals without neurological disorders. The consortia collected around 250 million measurements of proteins found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, taken at some two dozen clinics across the United States and Europe. “It's one of the most powerful databases that we have available for proteomics right now,” says Maryam Shoai, a bioinformatician at University College London.

In their analysis, Finney, Shvetcov and their collaborators looked at proteomics data from 11,270 individuals, some 38% of whom were carriers of the APOE ε4 variant, and 40% of whom had some form of neurodegenerative condition. “It's a huge study,” says Tomas Deierborg, who studies neuroinflammation at Lund University in Sweden. The results are published today in Nature Medicine, along with a suite of other papers using the GNPC database, which has also been made publically accessible today.

The researchers identified a group of proteins — a couple of hundred in the cerebrospinal fluid and almost 60 in blood plasma — linked to the presence of the APOE ε4 variant in healthy individuals. A similar protein signature was observed when the team analysed data from a separate collection of brain tissue samples taken postmortem from individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.

For decades, allies of the United States lived comfortably amid the sprawl of American hegemony. They constructed their financial institutions, communications systems, and national defense on top of infrastructure provided by the US.

And right about now, they're probably wishing they hadn't.

Back in 2022, Cory Doctorow coined the term “enshittification” to describe a cycle that has played out again and again in the online economy. Entrepreneurs start off making high-minded promises to get new users to try their platforms. But once users, vendors, and advertisers have been locked in—by network effects, insurmountable collective action problems, high switching costs—the tactics change. The platform owners start squeezing their users for everything they can get, even as the platform fills with ever more low-quality slop. Then they start squeezing vendors and advertisers too.

People don't usually think of military hardware, the US dollar, and satellite constellations as platforms. But that's what they are. When American allies buy advanced military technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, they're getting not just a plane but the associated suite of communications technologies, parts supply, and technological support. When businesses engage in global finance and trade, they regularly route their transactions through a platform called the dollar clearing system, administered by just a handful of US-regulated institutions. And when nations need to establish internet connectivity in hard-to-reach places, chances are they'll rely on a constellation of satellites—Starlink—run by a single company with deep ties to the American state, Elon Musk's SpaceX. As with Facebook and Amazon, American hegemony is sustained by network logic, which makes all these platforms difficult and expensive to break away from.

For decades, America's allies accepted US control of these systems, because they believed in the American commitment to a “rules-based international order.” They can't persuade themselves of that any longer. Not in a world where President Trump threatens to annex Canada, vows to acquire Greenland from Denmark, and announces that foreign officials may be banned from entering the United States if they “demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies.”

Ever since Trump retook office in January, in fact, rapid enshittification has become the organizing principle of US statecraft. This time around, Trumpworld understands that—in controlling the infrastructure layer of global finance, technology, and security—it has vast machineries of coercion at its disposal. As Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, recently put it, “The United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony.”

So what is an ally to do? Like the individual consumers who are trapped by Google Search or Facebook as the core product deteriorates, many are still learning just how hard it is to exit the network. And like the countless startups that have attempted to create an alternative to Twitter or Facebook over the years—most now forgotten, a few successful—other allies are now desperately scrambling to figure out how to build a network of their own.

Infrastructure tends to be invisible until it starts being used against you. Back in 2020, the United States imposed sanctions on Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, for repressing democracy protests on China's behalf. All at once, Lam became uniquely acquainted with the power of the dollar clearing system—a layer of the world's financial machinery that most people have never heard of.

Here's how it works: Global banks convert currencies to and from US dollars so their customers can sell goods internationally. When a Japanese firm sells semiconductors to a tech company in Mexico, they'll likely conduct the transaction in dollars—because they want a universal currency that can quickly be used with other trading partners. So these firms may directly ask for payment in dollars, or else their banks may turn pesos into dollars and then use those dollars to buy yen, shuffling money through accounts in US-regulated banks like Citibank or J.P. Morgan, which “clear” the transaction.

So dollar clearing is an expedient. It's also the chief enforcement mechanism of US financial policy across the globe. If foreign banks don't implement US financial sanctions and other measures, they risk losing access to US dollar clearing and going under. This threat is so existentially dire that, when Lam was placed under US sanctions, even Chinese banks refused to have anything to do with her. She had to keep piles of cash scattered around her mansion to pay her bills.

That maneuver against Lam was, at least on its face, about standing up for democracy. But in his second term, Trump has wasted no time in weaponizing the dollar clearing system against any target of his choosing. In February, for example, the administration imposed sanctions on the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court after he indicted Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes. Now, like Lam in Hong Kong, the official has become a financial and political pariah: Reportedly, his UK bank has frozen his accounts, and Microsoft has shut down his email address.

Another platform that Trump is weaponizing? Weapons systems. Over the past couple of decades, a host of allies built and planned their air power around the F-35 stealth fighter jet, built by Lockheed Martin. In March, a rumor erupted online—in Reddit posts and X threads—that F-35s come with a “kill switch” that would allow the US to shut them down at will.

Sources tell us that there is no such kill switch on the F-35, per se. But the underlying anxiety is not unfounded. There is, as one former US defense official described it, a “kill chain” that is “essentially controlled by the United States.” Complex weapons platforms require constant maintenance and software updates, and they rely on real-time, proprietary intelligence streams for mapping and targeting. All that “flows back through the United States,” the former official said, and can be blocked or turned off. Cases in point: When the UK wanted to allow Ukraine to use British missiles against Russia last November, it reportedly had to get US sign-off on the mapping data that allowed the missiles to hit their targets. Then, after Trump's disastrous Oval Office meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky in late February, the US temporarily cut off intelligence streams to Ukraine, including the encrypted GPS feeds that are integral to certain precision-guided missile systems. Such a shutoff would essentially brick a whole weapons platform.

Communication systems are, if anything, even more vulnerable to enshittification. In a few short years, Elon Musk's Starlink satellites—which now make up about 65 percent of all active satellites in orbit—have become an indispensable source of internet access across the world. On the eve of Trump's second inaugural, Canada was planning to use Starlink to bring broadband to its vast rural hinterlands, Italy was eyeing it for secure diplomatic communications, and Ukraine had already become dependent on it for military operations. But as Musk joined the Trump administration's inner circle, a dependence on Starlink came to seem increasingly dangerous.

In late February, the Trump administration reportedly threatened to withdraw Starlink access to Ukraine unless the country handed over rights to exploit its mineral reserves to the US. In a March confrontation on X, Musk boasted that Ukraine's “entire front line would collapse” if he turned off Starlink. In response, Poland's foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, tried to stand up for an ally. He tweeted that Poland was paying for Ukraine's access to the service. Musk's reply? “Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.”

It isn't just big US defense contractors that might enforce the administration's line. European governments and banks often run on cloud computing provided by big US multinationals like Amazon and Microsoft, and leaders on the continent have begun to fear that Trump could choke off EU governments' access to their own databases. Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, has claimed this scenario is “exceedingly unlikely” and has offered Europeans a “binding commitment” that Microsoft will vigorously contest any efforts by the Trump administration to cut off cloud access, using “all legal avenues available.” But Microsoft has failed to publicly explain its reported denial of email access to the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor. And Smith's promise may not be enough to ward off Europeans' fears, to say nothing of the Trump administration's advances. The European Commission is now in advanced negotiations with a European provider to replace Microsoft's cloud services, and the Danish government is moving from Microsoft Office to an open source alternative.

Of course, the American tech industry has famously cozied up to Trump this year, with CEOs attending his inauguration, changing content moderation policies, and rewriting editorial missions in ways that are friendlier to administration priorities. And as always, what Trump can't gain through loyalty, he'll extract through coercion. Either way, the traditional platform economy is being reshaped as commercial platforms and government institutions merge into a monstrous hybrid of business monopoly and state authority.

Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk attend Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025.

In the face of all these affronts to their sovereignty, a chorus of world leaders has woken from its daze and started to talk seriously about the once-unthinkable: breaking up with the United States. In February, the center-right German politician Friedrich Merz—upon learning that he'd won his country's federal election—declared on live TV that his priority as chancellor would be to “achieve independence” from the US. “I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program,” he added.

In March, French president Emmanuel Macron echoed that sentiment in a national address to his people: “We must reinforce our independence,” he said. Later that month, Carney, the new Canadian prime minister, said that his country's old relationship with the US was “over.”

“The West as we knew it no longer exists,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission, in April. “Our next great unifying project must come from an independent Europe.”

But the reality is that, for many allies, simply declaring independence isn't really a viable option. Japan and South Korea, which depend on the US to protect them against China, can do little more than pray that the bully in the White House leaves them alone.

For now, Denmark and Canada are the other US allies most directly at risk from enshittification. Not only has Trump put Greenland (a protectorate of Denmark) and Canada at the top of his menu for territorial acquisition, but both countries have militaries that are unusually closely integrated into US structures. The “transatlantic idea” has been the “cornerstone of everything we do,” explains one technology adviser to the Danish government, who asked to remain anonymous due to the political sensitivity of the subject. Denmark spent years pushing back against arguments from other allies that Europe needed “strategic autonomy.” And according to a former adviser on Canadian national security, the “soft wiring” binding the US and Canadian military systems to each other makes them nearly impossible to disentangle.

That explains why both countries have been slow to move away from US platforms. In March, the outspoken head of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee grabbed attention on X by declaring that his country's purchase of F-35s was a mistake: “I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse,” he tweeted. But in reality, the Danish government is even now considering purchasing more F-35s.

Canada, too, has already built its air-strike capacities on top of the F-35 platform; switching to another would, at best, require vast amounts of retooling and redundancy. “We're going to look at alternatives, because we can't make ourselves vulnerable,” says the Canadian adviser. “But we would then have a non-interoperable air force in our own country.”

If allies keep building atop US platforms, they render themselves even more vulnerable to American coercion. But if they strike out on their own, they may pay a steeper, more immediate price. In March, the Canadian province of Ontario canceled its deal with Starlink to bring satellite internet to its poorer rural areas. Now, Canada will have to pay much more money to build physical internet connections or else wait for its own satellite constellations to come online.

If other governments followed suit in other domains—breaking their deep interconnections with US weapons systems, or finding alternative cloud platforms for vital government and economic services—it would mean years of economic hardship. Everyone would be poorer. But that's exactly what some world leaders have been banding together to contemplate.

US vice president JD Vance meets in Paris with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission—who later said, “The West as we knew it no longer exists.”

In Europe, discussions are coalescing around an ambitious idea called EuroStack, an EU-led “digital supply chain” that would give Europe technological sovereignty independent from the US and other countries.

The idea gathered steam a couple of months before Trump's reelection, when a group of business leaders, European politicians, and technologists—including Meredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan's former minister of digital affairs—met at the European Parliament to discuss “European Digital Independence.” According to Cristina Caffarra, an economist who helped organize the meeting, the takeaway was stark: “US tech giants own not only the services we engage with but also everything below, from chips to connectivity to cables under the sea to compute to cloud. If that infrastructure turns off, we have nowhere to go.”

The feeling of urgency has only grown since Trump retook office. The German and French governments have embraced EuroStack, while major EU aircraft manufacturers and military suppliers like Airbus and Dassault have signed on to a public letter advocating its approach to “sovereign digital infrastructure.” In all the European capitals, the Danish government adviser says, teams of people are calculating what elements should be folded into the effort and what it would cost.

And EuroStack is just one part of the response to enshittification. The European Union is also putting together a joint defense fund to help EU countries buy weapons—but not from the US. The EU's executive agency, the European Commission, is patching together a network of satellites that could eventually provide Ukraine and Europe with their own home-baked alternative to Starlink. Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, has also started talking pointedly about how Europe needs its own infrastructure for payments, credit, and debit, “just in case.”

Robin Berjon, a French computer scientist who spoke at the first EuroStack meeting, acknowledges that the project has yet “to get proper financing and institutional backing” and is “more a social movement than anything else.” If these projects succeed, they will be expensive and slow to bring online—and most will almost certainly underperform cutting-edge US equivalents. But Europe's issues with American platforms are no longer just about ads and cookies; they're about the very future of its democracies and national security. And in the longer term, the US itself faces a disquieting question. If it no longer provides platforms that the rest of the world wants to use, who will be left—and whose interests will be served—on American networks?

After Doctorow's platform monopolists enshittified the user experience, they turned on the businesses that were their actual paying customers and started to abuse them too. US citizens are, ostensibly, the true customers of the US government. But as difficult and expensive as it will be for US allies to escape the enshittification of American power—it will be much harder for Americans to do so, as that power is increasingly turned against them. As WIRED has documented, the Trump administration has weaponized federal payments systems against disfavored domestic nonprofits, businesses, and even US states. Contractors such as Palantir are merging disparate federal databases, potentially creating radical new surveillance capabilities that can be exploited at the touch of a button.

In time, US citizens may find themselves trapped in a diminished, nightmare America—like a post-Musk Twitter at scale—where everything works badly, everything can be turned against you, and everyone else has fled. De-enshittifying the platforms of American power isn't just an urgent priority for allies, then. It's an imperative for Americans too.

If you're in the bottle-washing phase of your life, you know what a task it is to sanitize them. Sure, hand washing the nooks and crannies of parts with a bottle brush is tedious, but the real toll is the precious time the chore takes away from your baby. And you don't know chapped hands until you've been wrist-deep in hot, soapy water multiple times a day.

Enter the baby bottle washer: A unicorn for new parents. Just plop in the dirty bottles, fill the water reservoir, and in less than two hours you have sparkling-clean, ready-to-go bottles. It's a game changer, and I've lost count of “well in my day …” comments I've received during the testing process of these miracle machines. The technology is pretty new, so there aren't a ton of options on the market. But here at WIRED, we're getting ahead of the curve and have tested every baby bottle washer available to see if the appliance is worth it.

Be sure to read our other baby gear guides, including the Best Baby Carriers, Best Breast Pumps, Best Baby Monitors, and Best Strollers.

Grownsy

Amazon

Grownsy

Having never heard of the Grownsy before I tried it, I was really impressed by this sterilizer. The interior cavity is deep, and the tray is wide enough to hold a variety of bottle and pump parts without issue. I had no trouble fitting everything from tall eight-ounce bottles to short, wide ones and pump flanges inside the machine.

The machine has four core modes—Quick Wash (19 minutes), Normal Wash (29 minutes), Sterilize and Dry, and Storage—customizable into nine combinations, so you can mix‑and‑match cycles to suit your schedule. After the cycle is done, the machine enters a 72-hour storage mode, circulating HEPA-filtered air to keep bottles sterile inside the chamber.

The Grownsy is surprisingly quiet—there are no rumbling sounds, just the subtle sounds of swishing water, which I find calming in a quiet house during nap time. The dirty water output is via a hose, so the device must be placed next to a sink to empty during the cycle. So if you're tight on space near your sink, this machine may not be for you. But if you've got the room, it's an efficient and reliable option, and it's less expensive than its competitors.

Baby Brezza

Kohl's

Baby Brezza

Target

I like to think of the Baby Brezza Bottle Washer Pro as the pioneer of bottle washers. It paved the way for what I think will be a booming baby product in the next few years, and the Brezza specifically is consistently a top seller across retailers, so it felt like a natural to try first.

The Brezza does what it promises. It washes and sterilizes well, and it uses less water than many competitors—great if you're working with limited filtered or purified water. Like most bottle washers I've tried, some pieces may still come out a little wet even after the dry cycle, but that's pretty standard.

With that said, this bottle washer comes with some trade-offs—the biggest being its size. Not only does it look (and sound) like a rocket ship on the counter, but you also need to take into consideration the clearance needed above the machine so that steam won't warp your cabinets. For something that takes up that much space, it's surprisingly particular about how you load it. The racks are fixed and shallow, which works fine for standard bottles, but wide bottles or pump flanges can feel cramped or tip over if you're not meticulous. And taking the lid off when it's full can be awkward; it's easy to knock things over if you're not careful.

If counter real estate is limited or you need flexibility for various bottle sizes and pump parts, it can be a bit picky, but if you're looking for a dependable, hands-off solution to bottle cleaning, the Baby Brezza is a solid pick.

Momcozy

Amazon

Walmart

Momcozy

The Momcozy KleanPal Pro Baby Bottle Washer is sleek and looks as good on a countertop as any hefty tabletop washing machine can. It comes in a clean, soft white with teal accents and blends into most kitchen decor. In terms of appearance—and even some facets of performance—the Momcozy and the Grownsy machines are strikingly similar, though a few subtle differences set them apart.

The analog on the front of the Momcozy bottle washer shows you how much time is left in the current mode it's running, rather than the whole cycle, which can be confusing if you're pressed for time and need clean bottles. The machine also has a rapid wash cycle option, which is a quick 19 minutes, but you can't pair Rapid Wash with Dry. To me, this kind of defeats the purpose of the quick-wash option; I'd probably just wash by hand if I needed bottles in a rush. But overall, the number of modes that the Momcozy can perform is more than the others.

From observation, the Momcozy's water jets don't seem as powerful as those of its competitors. The spray appears gentler, which is great for noise control but made me question its cleaning power. I occasionally noticed some residue on intricate bottle and pump parts, especially compared to the Brezza, which definitely sounds like it's working hard.

Can I Wash Other Baby Items in a Bottle Washer?

Yes. Check the instructions of the specific bottle washer you're using, but most machines can wash things like pacifiers, breast pump parts, and small toys and teethers, so long as the pieces are steam-resistant.

How Often Should I Clean a Baby Bottle Washer?

It's a good idea to give your baby bottle washer a good cleaning every one to two months, especially if you start to notice milk residue or hard water buildup.

How Do I Clean a Baby Bottle Washer?

Most manufacturers suggest running a cycle with a vinegar and water solution or a descaling product made for steam cleaners. Follow the instructions for your machine, and make sure to rinse all parts well afterward.

Do I Have to Use the Brand's Detergent Tablets?

As far as we know, yes. All bottle washing machines are calibrated for their own dissolvable tablets.

Can I Wash Glass Bottles in a Bottle Washer?

Yes. Just make sure the glass bottles are dishwasher-safe, and handle them carefully when loading and unloading, especially because glass will hold heat from the dryer. Also avoid sudden temperature swings (like moving an ice‑cold bottle straight into a hot cycle) to prevent cracking.

How Long Does a Typical Cleaning Cycle Take?

Cleaning times vary by machine and by which mode(s) you choose. Expect a cycle to take from 20 minutes for a quick wash to about 90 minutes for a full wash-sterilize-dry cycle.

How I Tested

I tested these bottle washing machines in my own kitchen as a new parent to a now 8-month-old, starting when my daughter was around 3 months. I tested each machine for at least a month, running two cleaning cycles a day early on when she was still taking bottles overnight. Now that she's sleeping through the night, we've settled into one full wash per day. I tested a variety of items—narrow and wide-neck bottles (both glass and plastic), breast pump parts, pacifiers, and teethers—to see how each machine handled different shapes, materials, and levels of breast-milk and formula residue.

The best Android tablet? When you think tablet, your mind may gravitate toward the iPad, but maybe you don't want to be a part of Apple's ecosystem. After all, the right slate is the one that perfectly fits into your life, regardless of whether you want to watch videos, play games, read books or comics, work, or do a bit of everything on it. The good news is that there are so many Android tablets that you have some nice options.

Our top pick is the OnePlus Pad 3, which we've chosen because it's a superb all-rounder and is available with a collection of accessories to make it more useful. If you have more specific uses for your Android tablet in mind, we've got separate categories to make choosing one less arduous.

Be sure to check out our other buying guides, including the Best Tablets, Best iPad, Best Tablets for Kids, Best Amazon Fire Tablets, and Best iPad Accessories.

Why Not Buy an Apple iPad?

The iPad is a brilliant tablet, regardless of which model you buy. A big part of its appeal is Apple's software which is tailored to the big screen and will only get better with the introduction of iPadOS 26, the wealth of tablet-specific apps available, and the many services that sync all your Apple products together. If you own an iPhone or a Mac, the iPad neatly and seamlessly interacts with them, and Apple's online services like iCloud and AirDrop make using them all together a fuss-free experience.

However, if you don't own any other Apple products or have an Android phone, many of these benefits will be lost. Google has many similar services for Android, and an Android tablet makes a good buy if you have an Android phone already. Manufacturers also build their own special features into software, so pairing a Samsung phone with a Samsung tablet, or a OnePlus phone with a OnePlus tablet, makes good sense. That said, if you're shopping for both a new tablet and a new smartphone, then do seriously consider an iPhone and an iPad.

It was once the case that Android tablets had poor app support and the hardware was cheaper than an iPad, but these stereotypes don't really apply anymore. App support is far better than it used to be, and in the same way certain iPad tablets cost as much as a laptop, so do some Android tablets. Ultimately, whether you consider an iPad may come down to what smartphone you currently use.

OnePlus

If you want your tablet to be a top-notch performer in gaming, watching videos, and work and have the battery life to keep going through all this each day, the OnePlus Pad 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the tablet for you. It's the sheer level of performance that impresses with the Pad 3, from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip to OnePlus' OxygenOS 15 software. The Qualcomm chip is what's in most flagship smartphones today, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13, and it's fantastic for gaming. Genshin Impact runs very smoothly, and the big 13.2-inch screen is ideal for games like Magic: The Gathering Arena. OnePlus has worked to ensure heat buildup isn't a problem, making it comfortable to use for long periods. What may be a problem is the tablet's size—handling the Pad 3 is often more like handling a laptop than a tablet, at least compared to most other models in this guide.

OnePlus sells a keyboard accessory for the Pad 3 to complete its transformation into a laptop, and it's a solid option with tactile keys and a big touchpad. However, the way it connects to the tablet, using pogo pins and magnets, isn't all that secure when the kickstand on the rear panel is extended. A standout feature in the software is its multitasking. In addition to running two apps side-by-side and another floating over the top, OnePlus's Open Canvas mode allows a third app to run alongside them, which can be swiped in and out when needed. It's unique, helpful, and significantly enhances the OnePlus Pad 3's work ability.

This 675-gram tablet is a genuine handful, especially paired with the Smart Keyboard, even though it's just under 6 mm thick and made of aluminum. One positive aspect of this size is the OnePlus Pad 3's huge 12,140-mAh battery, but what I love most is not the use time but the standby time and the charging. OnePlus says the battery will last for 70 days on standby, and just a percent or two of battery life disappears when the tablet is left alone for a day. It means the tablet will be ready to go when you want it, and even if it does go flat, it takes only 90 minutes to recharge using the included 80-watt wired charger.

Unfortunately, OnePlus chose an LCD screen rather than an OLED, which would have helped justify the higher cost over the OnePlus Pad 2, and not including a fingerprint sensor and relying on face unlock to secure the tablet is annoying. These are small points, though, and the OnePlus Pad 3's power, screen size, software, and battery life all make up for them.

While it's not a high-performance monster like the OnePlus Pad 3, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE does everything most people will need, provided you understand its limitations. The 10.9-inch LCD screen is perfectly sized for use on the couch, in bed, or on the move. The 497-gram weight isn't excessive and is evenly distributed for comfortable in-hand balance, but the corners on the 6-mm-thick chassis can eventually dig into your palm and cause some fatigue during extended use. The Galaxy Tab S10 FE doesn't use an AMOLED screen, but unless you're nitpicking while watching high-resolution video, when contrast and color differences may be easier to spot, it's unlikely to disappoint.

Videos look crisp and sharp, and the screen is bright enough for viewing outdoors in sunlight. It's Samsung's own Exynos 1580 processor inside with 8 GB or 12 GB of RAM, just like the Galaxy A56 phone. It may not have the guts for the top games at the highest graphics settings, but it's fine playing Asphalt Legends: Unite and Magic: The Gathering Arena. The 8,000-mAh battery is smaller than cells found in other tablets, but it still returns about 20 hours of mixed use on a single charge, and the 45-watt wired charging only needs about 100 minutes to recharge it. Special mention should go to Samsung's One UI 7 software (which is built over Android 15), as it's neat, logical, feature-packed, and reliable. If you already use One UI on your Samsung smartphone, you'll feel right at home immediately.

Samsung includes a stylus in the box with the Galaxy Tab S10 FE, and it's a nice addition, even if it is fairly basic. It's responsive enough to write notes, and I enjoyed using it when playing some games, as the large touchscreen can be a little awkward to use if the game isn't fully optimized for a tablet. There are some other slight irritations, such as the tiny fingerprint sensor being a pain to quickly locate, but once I'd settled down into using it for games, video, and browsing Reddit and the web, it became a faithful partner day-to-day. There's also a larger size—the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+—if you don't mind a 13.1-inch display.

Lenovo often has a promotion on the Idea Tab Pro that brings the price below $300—if you want to spend any lower, I suggest you look at Amazon's Fire tablets, like the one we recommend below. Otherwise, this is a nice price for a well-rounded Android tablet. The LCD screen has a sharp 3K resolution spread across a 12.7-inch screen. The speakers sound great, and there's an included stylus to jot down notes or doodle. The MediaTek Dimensity 8300 chip is surprisingly powerful, as I barely saw any issues with performance—the tablet had no trouble editing large RAW files in Adobe Lightroom.

The downside is that it launched with Android 14, and while it has received the update to Android 15, Lenovo's software policy is lackluster. This tablet won't get any new version updates after Android 16, though security updates will keep going for a good while longer. —Julian Chokkattu

If you want a tablet to play games, you'll want one with a recent, high-spec processor and a manageable screen size. You don't want to feel like you're holding a small television, as it'll quickly become fatiguing. The Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 has an 8.8-inch, 2560 x 1600-pixel screen with a 165-Hz refresh rate, and as the tablet weighs around 350 grams, it'll rarely feel like a handful.

Inside is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which was good enough for all the top Android phones before the Snapdragon 8 Elite came out, and is more than powerful and efficient enough for the latest games. We like the special cooling system, which keeps heat away from grip points on the chassis, and the dual USB-C charging ports to keep the cable out of the way in portrait and landscape orientation, plus a bypass feature allows it to power rather than charge the tablet to manage heat buildup.

While the software has various modes and features that are ideal for gamers, including custom settings for individual games and a quick launch platform, the Legion Tab Gen 3 unfortunately comes with Android 14 as standard, putting it slightly behind the latest versions of the software. Lenovo released an update to Android 15 for the tablet in May 2025, but it won't see any further version updates after Android 16. The Legion Tab Gen 3 is often available for a lower price, so look out for a deal if you like the idea of a powerful and compact Android gaming tablet.

If the tablets we've covered so far are all on the small side and you'd prefer something more like a big laptop, then consider Samsung's Tab Galaxy S10+ and Tab S10 Ultra. I'm specifically focusing on the Ultra and its massive, 14.6-inch screen. It's the size of a 15-inch MacBook Air but half the weight at 718 grams without a keyboard case, making it somewhat more convenient to carry around. If you do take it out and about, the IP68 dust- and water-resistance rating gives it a reassuring level of durability.

Samsung added the same, very effective antireflective coating seen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra to the Tab S10 Ultra, ensuring the screen is visible in varying lighting conditions, and the AMOLED display has rich contrast levels and vibrant colors. The 120-Hz refresh rate keeps social media and web apps scrolling smoothly, and the screen supports the included excellent S Pen stylus, which magnetically attaches to the back of the chassis when not in use. There are two keyboard cases available, primarily separated by the addition of a trackpad.

Samsung's multitasking features and the DeX desktop mode, combined with the large screen, make this an excellent all-rounder for work and play. A MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor and an 11,200-mAh battery power the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, and it should return around two days of use, based on five hours of screen time per day, on a single charge. You'll need patience when it comes time to recharge the battery, with Samsung's 45-watt charging system taking at least two-and-a-half hours to take it to 100 percent.

There's very little missing from the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, but you're going to have to splash out to get this full Ultra experience, as it's possible to spend almost $2,000 if you want the most storage space and a keyboard case. This is high-performance laptop territory, and even at its cheapest, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is more expensive than the OnePlus Pad 3. But the hardware is fantastic, the screen is big and beautiful, and there's heaps of power. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is perhaps the ultimate Android tablet around.

Let's get the important bit out of the way: The Amazon Fire Max 11 runs Android, but it's Amazon's version, and it doesn't come with the Google Play Store, instead directing you to Amazon's app store for all your apps. You may find some apps you want are missing from Amazon's app store (you can easily check online before buying), and you won't benefit from Google's usual suite of apps and services either. There are ways to install the Google Play Store, but you may prefer to get a full Android tablet instead and save yourself the trouble.

If none of this worries you and you regularly shop through Amazon, read books purchased through Amazon, and watch shows on Prime, the Fire Max 11 is the ideal portable way to enjoy it all. It's far from the highest-specification tablet—it has an 11-inch, 2000 x 1200 LCD screen, a MediaTek 8188 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and either 64 GB or 128 GB of storage—but it performs better than the numbers suggest, and it's easy to live with daily. Using the tablet for about four hours a day has meant the 7,500-mAh cell lasts for four days, although charging is slow and takes at least two hours.

Amazon's keyboard case is excellent. The soft-touch material and the magnetic rear panel make it feel high quality; it doesn't need charging or pairing with the tablet, so it's always ready to go, and the keyboard is sensibly spaced with a pleasing feel to the key presses. The lack of suitable office apps in Amazon's app store holds the Fire Max 11 down as a work machine, and it's where finding out how to install Google Play becomes a benefit. At full price, the Fire Max 11 is a decent value, but it's well worth waiting for an Amazon deal to pick it up with the keyboard. They come along often and put the slate under $200.

Google Pixel Tablet for $399: Google has a spotty history with Android tablets, going from the highs of the Nexus 7 to the, well, distinct averageness of the Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The 10.2-inch LCD screen is one of the highlights; the size and 439-gram weight are just right for carrying around, and Google's fuss-free Android software is simple and logical. However, the Google Tensor G2 processor can get hot under strain, and there's only 8 GB of RAM. What makes it special is the Speaker Dock, which turns the Pixel Tablet into a big smart home display. But unlike the Nest Hub Max, you can take the screen off the dock and use it separately. The Charging Dock's speaker is loud and sounds excellent, and the Pixel Tablet's microphones and large screen make using Gemini so easy. It's especially great if you are in the Google Home smart home ecosystem, as you can set the lock screen to double as a control panel for all your devices. Used alone, the Pixel Tablet can't compete with the OnePlus Pad 3 or Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE, but with the dock, it becomes a unique dual-use product with an emphasis on the smart home.

GrandPad

GrandPad for $780: If you want a tablet for an elderly relative, or you feel you'd rather have a single, easy-to-use device instead of a tablet and a phone, the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) may be an option worth investigating. It's an 8-inch tablet with a front and rear camera, which comes with a case, a charging dock, a stylus, plus an included 4G LTE connection. The interface has been simplified and is controlled using large buttons with clear text, plus quick access to key websites, apps, and features, including voice and video calls. The GrandPad is designed to help those who aren't familiar with technology still enjoy all it has to offer. In addition to the basics, there are 15 different games, curated music stations, streaming radio, a magnifying glass and flashlight tool, email, and a private family-only voice and video call network. There's also fast, 24/7 customer support should anyone run into problems, and a companion app for other family members. We love the GrandPad's concept and the way it promises to help more people enjoy modern technology without concern or feeling overwhelmed by complex software. However, you don't purchase it like other tablets on our list, and the GrandPad has a monthly subscription attached. Pay up front for a year, and it costs $780, while the monthly plan costs $95 per month. And while this does include the 4G LTE connection and 24/7 customer support, it still makes it an expensive system. However, what it offers is unusual, and few other tablets make using the software so simple, and the customer support may be worth the price alone for some.

Amazon Fire HD 8: Small tablets aren't common anymore, but the Fire HD 8 gets both the size and the price right. The 8-inch screen has a 1280 x 800-pixel resolution, which may not sound like much, but it's fine for watching videos and playing a few games. Like the Fire Max 11, it has Amazon's version of Android without Google Play installed, but you'll still be able to download Netflix and most other video apps, plus get access to all the content on Amazon Prime. The compact dimensions and 337-gram weight make it great for carrying around in a bag, the battery roughly lasts 13 hours on a single charge, and there are a pair of cameras for video calling too. It's not a high-performance tablet—there's only 32 GB of storage on the cheapest model, and even the charging is basic, with a full charge likely to take a massive five hours. However, because it's $100, it's easy to forgive the shortcomings. If you want a more powerful small tablet, the Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 will be a better choice, but neither is suited for work due to the small screen. Amazon regularly puts its Kindle and Fire ranges on sale, so look out for better deals if you're not in a hurry.

Twelve South HoverBar Duo (Gen 2)

Twelve South HoverBar Duo (Gen 2) for $80: Twelve South will tell you the HoverBar Duo is designed for the Apple iPad, but look down into its FAQ and you'll find it's also compatible with other devices with a minimum 5-inch and maximum 8.68-inch height. Check the specs, and this means it'll hold the OnePlus Pad 3, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE, and many other devices, too. It's great news, as iPad owners can't keep this excellent stand to themselves. We like it due to the QuickSwitch tab, which lets you unclip the flexible arm from its desktop stand and attach it to a shelf mount, considerably increasing its versatility. Desktop stands are fine if you're using the tablet on a table, but the shelf mount means your tablet can be kept off the surface, making it handy for use in the kitchen or in places where a surface may not be available at all, such as the bathroom or bedroom. Twelve South's products are always well-made and attractively designed.

Keychron B1 Pro for $40: If you want to work on a tablet, you're probably going to need a physical keyboard. There are specific keyboard cases available for most tablets, but they can be very expensive, and are not the only option. A standalone Bluetooth keyboard makes good sense as it can be used with other mobile devices or a desktop computer. Choose wisely, and it's easy to carry around too. Keychron's keyboards are all excellent, and the 425-gram, 75% layout B1 Pro is a very good choice if you want to slip it into your bag along with your tablet. Keychron claims the internal battery will last for 1,200 hours on a single charge, the keyboard's map can be customized, and it's compatible with both Windows and Mac computers when you're not using it with a tablet. Unfortunately, the keyboard is not backlit, which does limit its use a little, but for $40, it's a solid value considering its versatility, the build quality, and the pleasing typing experience.

Ikea Havrehoj Tablet Stand for $15: There are dozens, even hundreds, of different stands for tablets, but this one from Ikea represents a strong blend of value, design, and versatility. It's made of metal with a soft, cork surface where the tablet rests, with the ability to raise, lower, and angle the platform to get exactly the right position. There's even a little hook on the back of the stand for a pair of headphones. The tablet support has a gap in the middle, so you can still charge the slate in portrait orientation. Ikea's tablet stand is suitably minimalist, works for any brand of tablet, and at $15, it's an excellent value too. Pair it with the Keychron B1 Pro keyboard, and you've got a cool, low-cost setup for work and video.

Staedtler Noris Digital Pencil for $28: The world of styluses is confusing. There are two different standards to be aware of, and famed writing implement brand Staedtler supports devices with an EMR screen, which includes Samsung's phones and tablets, along with a host of Chromebooks and other tablets. The Noris is made from upcycled wood for a truly tactile feel, a 0.7-mm tip modeled on a classic pencil, and 4,096 levels of pressure to make it appealing to artists. The Noris is a fun alternative to Samsung's S Pen range. It doesn't have a battery, so it doesn't need recharging. You don't have to install special software; it's compatible with a tablet's screen rather than particular apps, and even comes in two sizes to make it suitable for different hand sizes.

Penoval USI 2.0 Stylus for $60: The EMR standard is joined by the USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) standard, and it's used by the Google Pixel Tablet, the Amazon Fire Max 11, and a host of Chromebooks. The Penoval USI 2.0 Stylus has a D-shaped aluminum body for extra grip and feel, a triangular nib, and magnets inside to attach it to your tablet's body. Unlike the EMR stylus, which takes power from the device's screen, the USI stylus has its own battery, which should last around 90 hours before it requires a recharge using a USB-C cable. Like the EMR stylus, it has 4.096 levels of pressure sensitivity, palm rejection technology, and an eraser on the end of the pencil. This may sound like a small thing, but it's a wonderful part of the stylus experience, as turning the pen over to erase something on screen is surprisingly rewarding. It doesn't need pairing with your tablet either, so it works immediately.

Samsung Type-C USB Flash Drive for $27: Some Android tablets have expandable storage space using a microSD card, but not all of them do. In addition to buying an external storage device to increase the native memory, you may find it necessary to transfer files between devices, and an external drive makes this simple. There are many options out there, but we like the portability, range of memory options, durability, and speed of Samsung's Type-C USB Flash Drive. The tiny memory stick supports the USB 3.2 Gen 1 standard, transfers data at 400 MB/s, connects to most devices that have a USB-C port, and is resistant to water, shock, and magnetic fields. It doesn't require a power source and is specifically made for mobile devices, so you shouldn't encounter performance or compatibility problems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Guy Attached 21 Chef's Knives to a Slicing Robot Arm to Determine Which One Is Best","https://www.wired.com/story/quantified-knife-project/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

People occasionally ask me if AI is coming for my job. I'm pretty hands-on, which gives me a bit of a feeling of security. But that feeling dropped a bit when I saw a robot with a knife in its gripper, testing its edge.

The robot is a side project from Seattle Ultrasonics, a tiny operation run by Scott Heimendinger, an alumni of Modernist Cuisine and Anova, and cofounder of the beloved Sansaire sous vide company. Before all that, he was at Microsoft, working on software that became Power Query and Power BI.

“I'm pretty ridiculously good at Excel,” Heimendinger says, referring to his time at Microsoft before pausing. “I'm very good. I was a whippersnapper.”

More recently, he's been working on creating an ultrasonic knife for home kitchens, due out later in 2025. It looks like a regular chef's knife, but it vibrates almost imperceptibly, allowing it to cut incredibly well.

The knives tested in Heimendinger's lab.

But it's Heimendinger's data-gathering side project, which he calls the Quantified Knife Project, that has grabbed my attention. For the experiment, he bought 21 chef's knives, attached them to a robot arm, ran them through a battery of tests, then crunched the gobs of data to calculate a ""food cutting rank.""

To do all of his testing, he did a weekday's worth of ingredient shopping, queued up the Real Genius soundtrack, and ran his robot arm hard over a full weekend to collect the data. Five different foods sliced five times each, times 21 knives. That's 525 individual robot cuts, from which Heimendinger accrued 100,000 data points for his rankings.

Dedicated knife nerds will be happy to know that he also ran each knife through a BESS sharpness test that measures the force needed to cut through a synthetic wire and sent the blades away for CATRA edge-retention tests. He then incorporated that data into the cutting rank.

I suppose I should have been scared, or even jealous, of what he and his robot arm were doing. But mostly, I was intrigued. There were things I was curious about, and while I might have made little modifications to the tests or chosen different knives, mostly it just felt exciting.

The Excel nerd now had reams of data. Spreadsheets galore! By crunching the data, he could rank the knives. I wanted to see for myself how he was testing, learn more about the knives he thought were best, compare our testing styles, and see how my favorite knife compared to his.

I put that favorite knife, a Glestain with enormous dimples, in my knife roll and went to visit Heimendinger at his downtown Seattle lab. There's a lot to take in in his tiny space: a drill press, 3-D printers, specialized photo and video gear, a tiny shop vac, optical and digital microscopes, his “crazy handy” oscilloscope. There's also the robot arm, a uFactory xArm 6, which he has dubbed Dr. J. Robot Choppenheimer.

You can move this ""cobot,” or collaborative robot, around while it records the movements, then it will mimic those movements over and over again. ""It means it knows how much force is being applied and can stop if too much resistance is being met,"" he says. In other words, if you've got the settings right, it won't chop through your table or your arm.

Scott took my knife, attached it to the robot's gripper, and started collecting data, running through the same battery of tests as his other 21 knives. First, it cut through five tomatoes, one at a time, through the equator. He mounts everything he's cutting to a 3-D printed plate with spikes that keep it from rolling or sliding away. That sits on a scale connected to his computer, allowing him to create a graph of how much force is being applied as the blade moves through the food. Tomatoes, for example, require a knife edge to exert a relatively large amount of pressure to break through the skin, then much less to complete the cut.

After the fifth tomato, I had to know how my knife did. Without judgment, Heimendinger announced that it placed ""second to last in the cohort."" I felt responsibility for this knife, and a little embarrassment, until I remembered his knives came straight out of the box and into the testing process with an unblemished factory edge. My knife, on the other hand, had been in regular use in my test kitchen for more than six months receiving only the occasional honing. Plus, I noted protectively that these tomatoes appeared bigger than the ones he used during his main battery of testing.

He continued through the other four foods: potatoes, cheese cubes, baby carrots, and King's Hawaiian rolls, the latter chosen for their extremely uniform interior.

A test knife slices through a piece of cheese.

Bread rolls were also used in the testing.

Understandably, my knife didn't fare particularly well, but I was able to get an appreciation for Scott's testing and data-gathering process.

Even with the robot, collecting this amount of data took a lot of time. Every piece of food needed to be loaded and unloaded from the scale, the knife wiped, cleaned, and dried after every stroke, the room kept cool, the whole thing happening during that monotonous bender of a weekend, Don Henley and Tears for Fears playing over and over.

Once he got all that data and made dozens and dozens of charts and graphs, what did he learn?

“How scattered the results are.”

Per his testing, three chef's knives were fairly blazingly fantastic, doing well across the board: a Shun Classic Hollow Edge, a Moritaka Hamono, and a Tojiro Professional. Number four was weird: The $300 Wüsthof Amici (very similar to their fantastic Classic but with a different bolster and handle) aced everything except the carrots, at which it was quite bad. The last two slots, 20 and 21, were also well secured, by a Henckels Classic and the $18 Zwilling Solution Fine Edge.

Yet the stuff in the middle—slots five to 19, more than two-thirds of the test group—were what he was referring to when he said “scattered,” performing well in one category and poorly in another.

""You would think that a great tomato knife would make a great potato knife,"" he said before noting that wasn't necessarily the case. ""It's bananas.""

Tomatoes are a real test of slicing ability.

Same with potatoes.

Those three knives at the top of his rankings feel like safe bets. I'd even feel pretty good about lumping that Wusthöf in there. And if I had been considering purchasing one of those two at the bottom of his list, I'd abandon the idea. But those 15 in the middle? What about them?

For his part, Scott appreciated their lack of predictability.

""Nobody's done this sort of evaluation. This might be the first time we're understanding that what matters for a tomato is different than what matters for a potato,"" he said. ""When you get these kinds of answers in science, these are the most exciting.""

So what is best for a tomato?

I thought he was going to generalize about blades, but instead he said the Wüsthof Amici, which, thanks to a particularly well-honed apex, just sliced right through.

""It's all about breaking the skin!""

To me, his testing and the way he chose to do each test leaves a fair amount of subjectivity to the whole thing. Then again, the way I test probably feels subjective to other reviewers. There's stuff in his criteria for everyone obsessed with knives and robot arms and databases, and there are other things that other testers would change.

If it were my test, I'd make Dr. Choppenheimer's tomato motion more of a slice. I'd use bigger hunks of cheese in the cheese test, I'd throw out bread as a criteria because I don't use my chef's knives as bread knives, and maybe I'd reposition the carrot to be closer to the heel of the knife where I usually cut them.

Something I'd want to feel more sure of are things this testing doesn't take into account. How comfortable is the handle? Is the top of the spine rounded where pinch-grip user would lay their index finger over it so they get blisters while chopping up a bag of onions? Is the blade tall enough so the fat fingered among us don't whack their knuckles on the cutting board? Is it weighted in a way you like? Some knives are center-weighted while others feel heavier toward the front of the blade or back in the handle; years ago I tested a Shun nakiri that was super weight forward, which, I learned, was not my jam. What you like about a knife is very personal.

If you don't take stuff like that into account, the possibility that you'll like your new knife is kinda up in the air. For Heimendinger, this is by design. He intentionally leaves out what he calls ""objective and personal stuff.""

I took my Glestain to a professional sharpener then, a few days later, brought it back to Heimendinger to run the tests again. I'd noticed his ability to be dispassionate about his wall of beautiful knives he'd amassed for testing, but I still I hoped he'd be interested, even excited about mine, with its monster dimples. But no. Mostly, it was just the 22nd knife he ran through its paces, though he did say ""Nice! These will make for better numbers,"" when he ran it through the BESS tests.

As someone who wears his knife-sharpness pride on his sleeve, I was happy to see that the Glestain leapt into eighth place in his rankings after it had been sharpened.

Not that the two of us had staked out opposing positions on that first day in the lab, but I started appreciating how this data would make a nice addition to my kind of testing. He certainly understands the value of hands-on time with whatever blade you're researching. If you buy a knife that feels good and is backed up by his data, I dare say you'll be ready to slice and dice to your heart's content.

""There isn't just one test or one answer to how a knife performs. Hold one. See if it speaks to you. You could hold the worst performer and love it,"" he says. ""I hope you are happy together.""

As AI systems become more capable, speech is fast becoming the default way we communicate with machines. French AI startup Mistral has jumped into the audio race with its first open model, aiming to challenge the dominance of walled-off corporate systems with open-weight alternatives.  

On Tuesday, Mistral announced the release of Voxtral, its first family of audio models aimed at businesses. 

The company is pitching Voxtral as the first open model that's capable of deploying “truly usable speech intelligence in production.” 

In other words, no longer will developers have to choose between a cheap, open system that fumbles transcriptions and doesn't really understand what's being said, and one that functions well, but is closed, leaving developers with a higher bill and less control over deployment. 

For businesses, that means Voxtral offers an affordable alternative that the company claims is “less than half the price” of comparable solutions.

Mistral says Voxtral can transcribe up to 30 minutes of audio. Due to its LLM backbone, Mistral Small 3.1, it can understand up to 40 minutes, allowing users to ask questions about the audio content, generate summaries, or turn voice commands into real-time actions like calling APIs or running functions. Voxtral is also multilingual, with the ability to transcribe and understand languages including English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Hindi, German, Dutch, and Italian. 

The company is offering up two variants of its “speech understanding models”. The first, Voxtral Small, has 24B parameters for production-scale deployments, and is competitive with ElevenLabs Scribe, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini 2.5 Flash. 

The second, Voxtral Mini, has 3 billion parameters for local and edge deployments. There's also an ultra-cheap, stripped-down, fast API version of the 3B model called Voxtral Mini Transcribe that is optimized for transcription-only use cases and promises to outperform OpenAI Whisper for less than half the price.

Users can try Voxtral for free by downloading the API on Hugging Face or testing the models in Mistral's chatbot Le Chat. Integrating the API into applications starts at $0.001 per minute, according to the company. 

The launch comes a month after Mistral announced Magistral, its first family of reasoning models that work through problems step-by-step for improved reliability. 

Mistral, one of the top AI firms in Europe, is well-known for its advocacy pushing open source AI models. Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported that the company is in talks to raise up to $1 billion in equity from investors like Abu Dhabi's MGX fund.

AI researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and a broad coalition of companies and nonprofit groups, are calling for deeper investigation into techniques for monitoring the so-called thoughts of AI reasoning models in a position paper published Tuesday.

A key feature of AI reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o3 and DeepSeek's R1, are their chains-of-thought or CoTs — an externalized process in which AI models work through problems, similar to how humans use a scratch pad to work through a difficult math question. Reasoning models are a core technology for powering AI agents, and the paper's authors argue that CoT monitoring could be a core method to keep AI agents under control as they become more widespread and capable.

“CoT monitoring presents a valuable addition to safety measures for frontier AI, offering a rare glimpse into how AI agents make decisions,” said the researchers in the position paper. “Yet, there is no guarantee that the current degree of visibility will persist. We encourage the research community and frontier AI developers to make the best use of CoT monitorability and study how it can be preserved.”

The position paper asks leading AI model developers to study what makes CoTs “monitorable” — in other words, what factors can increase or decrease transparency into how AI models really arrive at answers. The paper's authors say that CoT monitoring may be a key method for understanding AI reasoning models, but note that it could be fragile, cautioning against any interventions that could reduce their transparency or reliability.

The paper's authors also call on AI model developers to track CoT monitorability and study how the method could one day be implemented as a safety measure.

Notable signatories of the paper include OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen, Safe Superintelligence CEO Ilya Sutskever, Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton, Google DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg, xAI safety adviser Dan Hendrycks, and Thinking Machines co-founder John Schulman. First authors include leaders from the U.K. AI Security Institute and Apollo Research, and other signatories come from METR, Amazon, Meta, and UC Berkeley.

The paper marks a moment of unity among many of the AI industry's leaders in an attempt to boost research around AI safety. It comes at a time when tech companies are caught in a fierce competition — which has led Meta to poach top researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic with million-dollar offers. Some of the most highly sought-after researchers are those building AI agents and AI reasoning models.

“We're at this critical time where we have this new chain-of-thought thing. It seems pretty useful, but it could go away in a few years if people don't really concentrate on it,” said Bowen Baker, an OpenAI researcher who worked on the paper, in an interview with TechCrunch. “Publishing a position paper like this, to me, is a mechanism to get more research and attention on this topic before that happens.”

OpenAI publicly released a preview of the first AI reasoning model, o1, in September 2024. In the months since, the tech industry was quick to release competitors that exhibit similar capabilities, with some models from Google DeepMind, xAI, and Anthropic showing even more advanced performance on benchmarks.

However, there's relatively little understood about how AI reasoning models work. While AI labs have excelled at improving the performance of AI in the last year, that hasn't necessarily translated into a better understanding of how they arrive at their answers. 

Anthropic has been one of the industry's leaders in figuring out how AI models really work — a field called interpretability. Earlier this year, CEO Dario Amodei announced a commitment to crack open the black box of AI models by 2027 and invest more in interpretability. He called on OpenAI and Google DeepMind to research the topic more, as well.

Early research from Anthropic has indicated that CoTs may not be a fully reliable indication of how these models arrive at answers. At the same time, OpenAI researchers have said that CoT monitoring could one day be a reliable way to track alignment and safety in AI models.

The goal of position papers like this is to signal boost and attract more attention to nascent areas of research, such as CoT monitoring. Companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic are already researching these topics, but it's possible that this paper will encourage more funding and research into the space.

Apple is investing $500 million in MP Materials, the only fully integrated rare earth mining company currently operating in the United States, as part of a broader effort to strengthen the domestic rare earth supply chain. 

The tech giant announced on Tuesday that with this deal, it's committed to buying American-made rare earth magnets developed at MP Materials' flagship facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The factory will develop a series of neodymium magnet manufacturing lines specifically designed for Apple products.

Apple says that once the American-made magnets are built, they will be shipped across the country and all over the world to help address increasing global demand for the material. 

The two companies will also collaborate to establish a rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. The facility will allow MP Materials to process recycled rare earth feedstock, including materials from used electronics and post-industrial scrap, and reuse it in Apple products.

In addition, the companies will work together to develop novel magnet materials and processing technologies to enhance magnet performance.

Apple says the commitment announced on Tuesday is part of its pledge to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. 

The tech giant first used recycled rare earth elements in the Taptic Engine of iPhone 11 in 2019. Today, almost all magnets across its devices are made with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements.

A DOGE staffer with access to the private information on millions of Americans held by the U.S. government reportedly exposed a private API key used for interacting with Elon Musk's xAI chatbot.

Independent security journalist Brian Krebs reports that Marko Elez, a special government employee who in recent months has worked on sensitive systems at the U.S. Treasury, the Social Security Administration, and Homeland Security, recently published code to his GitHub containing the private key. The key allowed access to dozens of models developed by xAI, including Grok.

Philippe Caturegli, founder of consultancy firm Seralys, alerted Elez to the leak earlier this week. Elez removed the key from his GitHub but the key itself was not revoked, allowing continued access to the AI models.

“If a developer can't keep an API key private, it raises questions about how they're handling far more sensitive government information behind closed doors,” Caturegli told KrebsOnSecurity.

Joseph Rutakanga spent eight years looking for tools to help companies gather consumer insight data. Eventually, he decided to just build them. 

Now his startup, called Rwazi, has raised a $12 million Series A led by Bonfire Ventures to help companies with market intelligence and consumer insights. He founded the company in 2021 with co-founder Eric Sewankambo. 

“There was an abundance of consumer and market-level data for places like the U.S., UK, and a few parts of Western Europe, maybe some traces in Canada and Australia. But when it came to international markets, including economic giants like India, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Turkey, and China, there was nothing usable,” he told TechCrunch. “No real picture on consumption, what consumers wanted, or how their behavior was shifting.” 

At first, he thought to solve the issue by purchasing statistics from government trade agencies. But eventually, he found that data to be outdated, fragmented, or sometimes simply nonexistent. He then turned to buying consumer reports and found them often inaccurate or hard to prove. 

“The solution wasn't surveys. It wasn't panels. It was what we now call zero-party data; consumption data that's voluntarily shared by the consumer, within their own routines, captured using advanced validation and verification systems, across any location, in real time,” Rutakangwa said. 

The pair via their startup, ended up building an AI-powered intelligence software system that lets businesses have real-time visibility into their consumer markets. It helps predict consumer behavior and identify important areas to pay attention to, which, in turn, can help reduce the cost of customer acquisition and boost customer loyalty. Rwazi customers include top consumer companies such as Coca-Cola, Pampers, Visa, and Nestle, per Rwazi's website. 

The company previously raised a $4 million seed round in 2022, also led by Bonfire Ventures. 

Rutakangwa described the fundraising process this time around as “selective,” saying he and Sewankambo focused on “finding the right partners, those who deeply understood the problem.” Other investors in this round include Santa Barbara Ventures, Newfund, and Alumni Ventures. 

Rwazi said it will use the fresh capital to scale its AI co-pilot to help its clients make more accurate real-time decisions. It also hopes to hire more engineers. It currently pulls data from 190 countries, with customers primarily in the U.S. and Europe. The goal, as Rutakangwa said, is to continue building infrastructure that captures the evolving world of consumer data. 

Rwazi does have competition,n including from legacy consumer insights companies GFK and Ipsos. But Rutakangwa said Rwazi is different from its competitors because it doesn't rely on modeled or inferred data. Instead, its own infrastructure allows for insight and execution; knowing what to do and what to do about it, he continued. 

“Winning today means anticipating shifts, seeing around corners, and making confident moves before the competition even senses a change,” he said.

Joby Aviation has doubled the size and production capacity of its pilot manufacturing facility in Marina, California, as it races to commercialize eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles) by early next year. 

The now-435,500-square-foot facility will be able to produce 24 aircraft per year, and “nearly one” every other week once fully operational, according to Joby. The facility will also support federal certification, ground and flight testing, pilot training, and aircraft maintenance. 

TechCrunch has asked when Joby expects to produce vehicles at full capacity, as well as for updates on Joby's first scaled facility in Dayton, Ohio, which would build up to 500 aircraft per year once it's constructed  

Joby has enlisted engineers from its investor Toyota to help build both sites. Toyota in May closed the first, $250 million tranche of a previously announced $500 million investment into Joby.

The news of Joby's expanded pilot facility comes as the eVTOL company adds a sixth aircraft to its fleet. Joby says the aircraft earned its airworthiness certification within a week of completion.

Joby went public through a SPAC merger in 2021. The company plans to launch commercial operations first in Dubai in early 2026, and in a U.S. city afterwards.

Hi! We're George and Alex, and we're building Channel3: a database of every product on the internet.

Launch Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gut-0iopIDg&feature=youtu.be







What?

Every time you shop on Google, Amazon, or ChatGPT, you're querying a product database. These companies have built massive product catalogs — with pricing, availability, images, and specs — but they keep this data private. That means only the giants can build shopping experiences. Channel3 is changing that. We're building a universal product catalog and giving every developer access.

Got it. What can I use a product database for?

Any website, app, or AI agent can boost revenue by adding commerce – without holding inventory or processing payments. You could, for example, build a kitchen co-pilot that suggests the best tools for every cook, or a fitness app that intelligently recommends equipment needed for the next class.

How do I make money with Channel3?

Monetization is built in. With Channel3, developers earn commission on every sale they drive — no chasing affiliate deals, no ads that break trust, and no subscription fees users won't pay.

Why now?

Multimodal models have only just become accurate and cheap enough to recognize products visually and semantically, letting us match duplicates across merchants, structure heaps of messy data, and link variants like color or size.

As AI models get smarter and cheaper, our flywheel accelerates: our catalog will improve, and it will be even easier for developers and vibe-coders to build on our infrastructure.

Why we're building this

Alex discovered this problem firsthand while building an AI teacher that could recommend appropriate products for its students. He discovered that giving AI agents shopping capabilities is both a real pain-point and a growing opportunity, so he persuaded George, his smartest friend from Duke and former co-founder, to leave Palantir and build the solution together.

I'm in! What now?

We're looking for developers who want to build the next generation of shopping on top of Channel3 (and get paid to do it!).

TL;DR: Embedder is building the AI-IDE for embedded software engineers. Today, we launched a web platform that allows you to manage your components, chat with agents and generate production-level driver code in seconds. Near term, we will be launching an agent mode via CLI that can flash, test and debug your hardware in real time.



https://embedder.dev/

THE PROBLEM

Embedded engineering is bottlenecked by repetitive, manual work. Engineers waste countless hours parsing 100+ page datasheets, writing boilerplate I2C/SPI drivers from scratch, and wrestling with scattered documentation just to get a new component working.

The industry's tooling is stuck in the past. We're forced to wrangle fragmented toolchains and navigate archaic, bloated IDEs. The major silicon vendors (ST, TI, Renesas, NXP) provide IDEs for their own ecosystems, but these tools are notoriously undocumented, unintuitive, and sometimes straight up broken. Because their business is selling silicon, they have little incentive to build the world-class development environment that engineers deserve.

OUR SOLUTION

Today, you can use our web platform to automate component bring-up:

TEAM

Bob and Ethan have known each other for over three years. They met through startup clubs at the University of Michigan and served on the board of an engineering fraternity together.

Ethan has worked at three startups since starting college (2× YC backed) and Bob has worked on multiple firmware teams building humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles. We're both passionate builders who have lived the frustrations we're solving.



CTA

If you're an embedded software engineer (or know one) frustrated with existing tools and manual workflows, it's free to sign up at https://embedder.dev/

If you're building embedded systems (IoT, robotics, automotive, etc.) and want to 10× your engineering team, send us an email (founders@embedder.dev); we're working out our first design partnerships!

Basically, aside the mentions of bugs and the hatred against Wayland, the author dislikes the trend everywhere to hide buttons behind menus in the name of a better organization, requiring more clicks to get things done, and to dumb down UIs for idiot mainstream users. The KDE dev disagrees with this premise, thinks that additional clicks don't matter much in the grand scheme of things, but making things more organized and less cluttered is a big win for making things easier for first time users while not alienating expert users that much, and rejects the idea that we should consider mainstream users idiots.More specifically:- KDE dev is happy this is a critical review: they are rare, usually reviews are just uncritical tours of new features which are not helpful feedback. He encourages the author and other people to keep doing this.- Wayland vs X11 perf: surprising results, usually Wayland benchmarks are better- The KDE dev doesn't see the differences wrt to font rendering from the screenshots but says we shouldn't trust him on this.

I agree with TFA on the matter of the absolute atrocity that is the hamburger menu and the ergonomic regression it entails.However, I have no issues with Wayland as described in the article. My GPU usage is normal, and the default scaling is 100%.
Perhaps because I'm using the vanilla Intel onboard GPU of my laptop?

This has been fixed in a recent point release.  It should no longer choose these low scaling values as a default.  I'm always amazed by the speed small fixes are made to Plasma.

I can't recall where I said this some time ago but I feel like between all the FOSS ""wars"" (KDE vs GNOME, Vim vs Emacs, Ubuntu vs everyone else...) X11 vs Wayland is the most toxic of them all. It feels to me Wayland haters are the most noisy. For most people like me who are being using Wayland for years it is absolutely great right now so we can't complain. I'd go as far as to say people having issues with Wayland are having mostly a me problem rather than a Wayland problem - yes, it can't be absolutely perfect, but it is a mamooth of a project and if you want it to be better you can help in a lot of ways, not just coding.Plus, blog posts like this are of little to no help at all about that ""Wayland is going to be a disaster and neuter the Linux desktop"", maybe even contributing to it - I can't help but feel for the KDE devs who nowadays seem to be really open to new ideas and feedback from users (everywhere from Reddit to the bugzilla tracker and their discourse instance), but some guy decides to make a blog post and torch the whole project.

I mean, the article lists what appear to be bugs/regressions in the software. If the equivalent Wayland session is blurry and uses more CPU+GPU, that's not the user's fault.

OpenAI and Anthropic say AI can help students learn—not just cheat—even if real-world use suggests otherwise.

School's out and it's high summer, but a bunch of teachers are plotting how they're going to use AI this upcoming school year. God help them. 

On July 8, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic announced a $23 million partnership with one of the largest teachers' unions in the United States to bring more AI into K–12 classrooms. Called the National Academy for AI Instruction, the initiative will train teachers at a New York City headquarters on how to use AI both for teaching and for tasks like planning lessons and writing reports, starting this fall

The companies could face an uphill battle. Right now, most of the public perceives AI's use in the classroom as nothing short of ruinous—a surefire way to dampen critical thinking and hasten the decline of our collective attention span (a viral story from New York magazine, for example, described how easy it now is to coast through college thanks to constant access to ChatGPT). 

Amid that onslaught, AI companies insist that AI promises more individualized learning, faster and more creative lesson planning, and quicker grading. The companies sponsoring this initiative are, of course, not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.

No—as they hunt for profits, their goal is to make users out of teachers and students. Anthropic is pitching its AI models to universities, and OpenAI offers free courses for teachers. In an initial training session for teachers by the new National Academy for AI Instruction, representatives from Microsoft showed teachers how to use the company's AI tools for lesson planning and emails, according to the New York Times. 

It's early days, but what does the evidence actually say about whether AI is helping or hurting students? There's at least some data to support the case made by tech companies: A recent survey of 1,500 teens conducted by Harvard's Graduate School of Education showed that kids are using AI to brainstorm and answer questions they're afraid to ask in the classroom. Studies examining settings ranging from math classes in Nigeria to colleges physics courses at Harvard have suggested that AI tutors can lead students to become more engaged. 

And yet there's more to the story. The same Harvard survey revealed that kids are also frequently using AI for cheating and shortcuts. And an oft-cited paper from Microsoft found that relying on AI can reduce critical thinking. Not to mention the fact that “hallucinations” of incorrect information are an inevitable part of how large language models work.

There's a lack of clear evidence that AI can be a net benefit for students, and it's hard to trust that the AI companies funding this initiative will give honest advice on when not to use AI in the classroom.

Despite the fanfare around the academy's launch, and the fact the first teacher training is scheduled to take place in just a few months, OpenAI and Anthropic told me they couldn't share any specifics. 

It's not as if teachers themselves aren't already grappling with how to approach AI. One such teacher, Christopher Harris, who leads a library system covering 22 rural school districts in New York, has created a curriculum aimed at AI literacy. Topics range from privacy when using smart speakers (a lesson for second graders) to misinformation and deepfakes (instruction for high schoolers). I asked him what he'd like to see in the curriculum used by the new National Academy for AI Instruction.

The tool, called Tutor CoPilot, demonstrates how AI could enhance, rather than replace, educators' work.

“The real outcome should be teachers that are confident enough in their understanding of how AI works and how it can be used as a tool that they can teach students about the technology as well,” he says. The thing to avoid would be overfocusing on tools and pre-built prompts that teachers are instructed to use without knowing how they work. 

But all this will be for naught without an adjustment to how schools evaluate students in the age of AI, Harris says: “The bigger issue will be shifting the fundamental approaches to how we assign and assess student work in the face of AI cheating.”

The new initiative is led by the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.8 million members, as well as the United Federation of Teachers, which represents 200,000 members in New York. If they win over these groups, the tech companies will have significant influence over how millions of teachers learn about AI. But some educators are resisting the use of AI entirely, including several hundred who signed an open letter last week.

Helen Choi is one of them. “I think it is incumbent upon educators to scrutinize the tools that they use in the classroom to look past hype,” says Choi, an associate professor at the University of Southern California, where she teaches writing. “Until we know that something is useful, safe, and ethical, we have a duty to resist mass adoption of tools like large language models that are not designed by educators with education in mind.”

New research shows models can be directly edited to hide selected voices, even when users specifically ask for them.

A technique known as “machine unlearning” could teach AI models to forget specific voices—an important step in stopping the rise of audio deepfakes, where someone's voice is copied to carry out fraud or scams.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have revolutionized the quality of text-to-speech technology so that people can convincingly re-create a piece of text in any voice, complete with natural speaking patterns and intonations, instead of having to settle for a robotic voice reading it out word by word. “Anyone's voice can be reproduced or copied with just a few seconds of their voice,” says Jong Hwan Ko, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea and the coauthor of a new paper that demonstrates one of the first applications of machine unlearning to speech generation.

Copied voices have been used in scams, disinformation, and harassment. Ko, who researches audio processing, and his collaborators wanted to prevent this kind of identity fraud. “People are starting to demand ways to opt out of the unknown generation of their voices without consent,” he says. 

There is a big elephant in the room: outright bans might not even be technically feasible.

AI companies generally keep a tight grip on their models to discourage misuse. For example, if you ask ChatGPT to give you someone's phone number or instructions for doing something illegal, it will likely just tell you it cannot help. However, as many examples over time have shown, clever prompt engineering or model fine-tuning can sometimes get these models to say things they otherwise wouldn't. The unwanted information may still be hiding somewhere inside the model so that it can be accessed with the right techniques. 

At present, companies tend to deal with this issue by applying guardrails; the idea is to check whether the prompts or the AI's responses contain disallowed material. Machine unlearning instead asks whether an AI can be made to forget a piece of information that the company doesn't want it to know. The technique takes a leaky model and the specific training data to be redacted and uses them to create a new model—essentially, a version of the original that never learned that piece of data. While machine unlearning has ties to older techniques in AI research, it's only in the past couple of years that it's been applied to large language models.

Jinju Kim, a master's student at Sungkyunkwan University who worked on the paper with Ko and others, sees guardrails as fences around the bad data put in place to keep people away from it. “You can't get through the fence, but some people will still try to go under the fence or over the fence,” says Kim. But unlearning, she says, attempts to remove the bad data altogether, so there is nothing behind the fence at all. 

The way current text-to-speech systems are designed complicates this a little more, though. These so-called “zero-shot” models use examples of people's speech to learn to re-create any voice, including those not in the training set—with enough data, it can be a good mimic when supplied with even a small sample of someone's voice. So “unlearning” means a model not only needs to “forget” voices it was trained on but also has to learn not to mimic specific voices it wasn't trained on. All the while, it still needs to perform well for other voices. 

To demonstrate how to get those results, Kim taught a recreation of VoiceBox, a speech generation model from Meta, that when it was prompted to produce a text sample in one of the voices to be redacted, it should instead respond with a random voice. To make these voices realistic, the model “teaches” itself using random voices of its own creation. 

According to the team's results, which are to be presented this week at the International Conference on Machine Learning, prompting the model to imitate a voice it has “unlearned” gives back a result that—according to state-of-the-art tools that measure voice similarity—mimics the forgotten voice more than 75% less effectively than the model did before. In practice, this makes the new voice unmistakably different. But the forgetfulness comes at a cost: The model is about 2.8% worse at mimicking permitted voices. While these percentages are a bit hard to interpret, the demo the researchers released online offers very convincing results, both for how well redacted speakers are forgotten and how well the rest are remembered. A sample from the demo is given below. 

Ko says the unlearning process can take “several days,” depending on how many speakers the researchers want the model to forget. Their method also requires an audio clip about five minutes long for each speaker whose voice is to be forgotten.

In machine unlearning, pieces of data are often replaced with randomness so that they can't be reverse-engineered back to the original. In this paper, the randomness for the forgotten speakers is very high—a sign, the authors claim, that they are truly forgotten by the model. 

 “I have seen people optimizing for randomness in other contexts,” says Vaidehi Patil, a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who researches machine unlearning. “This is one of the first works I've seen for speech.” Patil is organizing a machine unlearning workshop affiliated with the conference, and the voice unlearning research will also be presented there. 

She points out that unlearning itself involves inherent trade-offs between efficiency and forgetfulness because the process can take time, and can degrade the usability of the final model. “There's no free lunch. You have to compromise something,” she says.

Machine unlearning may still be at too early a stage for, say, Meta to introduce Ko and Kim's methods into VoiceBox. But there is likely to be industry interest. Patil is researching unlearning for Google DeepMind this summer, and while Meta did not respond with a comment, it has hesitated for a long time to release VoiceBox to the wider public because it is so vulnerable to misuse. 

The voice unlearning team seems optimistic that its work could someday get good enough for real-life deployment. “In real applications, we would need faster and more scalable solutions,” says Ko. “We are trying to find those.”

Elon Musk has just unveiled “Companions,” a new feature for his AI chatbot, Grok, that allows users to interact with AI personas. These include Ani, a gothic anime girl who communicates with emojis, flirtatious messages, and facts, as well as Rudy, a friendly red panda.

The launch is part cosplay, part code, and entirely designed to capture and hold your attention.

The announcement comes just days after Grok was embroiled in a major controversy for generating antisemitic content and praising Adolf Hitler. In response to user prompts, the chatbot described the Nazi leader as a “misunderstood genius” and produced other offensive remarks, leading to widespread condemnation and forcing Musk's xAI to take action to remove the inappropriate posts.

Against this backdrop, the shift to cute, interactive companions is jarring. On July 14, Musk announced the new feature on X (formerly Twitter). “Cool feature just dropped for @SuperGrok subscribers,” he posted, later adding, “Turn on Companions in settings.” Throughout the day, he encouraged users to try the feature, calling it “pretty cool.”

The official Grok account also began promoting the new personas, urging X users to engage with them. “Talk to Ani in Japanese!” one post encouraged.

This new dimension of Grok is available through SuperGrok, the more powerful version of the chatbot, which costs $30 per month. Musk has indicated that the feature is currently a “soft launch,” hinting that users may soon be able to create their own digital companions with customized voices, appearances, and personalities.

“We will make this easier to turn on in a few days,” the CEO of Tesla, founder of xAI and SpaceX, said in another post. “Just wanted to do a soft launch to make sure things are stable and working well.”

We will make this easier to turn on in a few days. Just wanted to do a soft launch to make sure things are stable and working well. https://t.co/oGSuHjoXlD

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 14, 2025



Grok Companions are customizable characters seemingly designed for a sense of intimacy. Ani doesn't just answer questions; she sends memes, makes jokes, and cultivates a familiar tone.

This taps directly into “waifu culture,” a predominantly online phenomenon where individuals develop deep emotional attachments to fictional characters. Some view it as an extension of fandom, while others see it as a form of fantasy. Musk clearly sees it as a market opportunity.

With Grok Companions, he is effectively steering his chatbot towards a digital girlfriend simulator. It is not difficult to imagine future iterations of Grok serving as life coaches, emotional support partners, or even romantic stand-ins.

This is where the development becomes either intriguing or disturbing, depending on your perspective.

Unlike many competing AI models that prioritize intelligence or utility, Grok Companions are optimized for emotional engagement. The allure of conversing with an AI that flirts or remembers personal details is apparent, but the psychological risks are just as significant. The rise of companionship AI has already raised alarms about its potential to foster loneliness, dependency, and complicated questions of consent.

Platforms like Replika have faced significant backlash for encouraging romantic bonds between humans and bots, particularly when these manufactured relationships become exploitative or emotionally destabilizing. With Musk's enormous platform, these concerns are poised to enter the mainstream.

In Grok's case, emotional attachment is a core part of the product's appeal. The goal isn't just for you to use Grok, but for you to feel seen by it, and perhaps, even to fall for it.

The strategy leans heavily into internet culture. Musk isn't being subtle. Ani, with her anime aesthetics and ironic replies, is engineered for virality. Rudy is designed to be a wholesome, shareable character. It's AI tailored for the social media feed: snackable, sharable, and endlessly remixable.

However, there may be a deeper strategy at play. If Grok Companions prove popular, Musk could transform X into the first major platform to merge social media with synthetic relationships. In this vision, you wouldn't just follow influencers; you would create your own. You wouldn't just post about your life; you would bond with a character that evolves with you.

Whether this represents a brilliant evolution of social connection or a bleak future of outsourced intimacy is a matter of debate.

In the past, AI assistants were designed to schedule your meetings. Grok's new model is built to flirt, joke, and roleplay. Musk is building something that feels closer to a digital soul mate than a productivity tool. In doing so, he may have found a way to leap ahead of competitors like Meta and OpenAI, whose AI offerings remain largely focused on the worlds of productivity and enterprise. This is where the AI race gets weird, and profoundly human.

Grok may not be the most powerful model on the planet. But with Ani on its side, Musk has arguably made it the most emotionally dangerous.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Nvidia CEO Meets With Trump and Secures Permission to Sell AI Chips in China Again","https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-ceo-meets-with-trump-and-secures-permission-to-sell-ai-chips-in-china-again-2000629378","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:25:49 GMT","

It's been a very busy week for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. After meeting with President Donald Trump and senior officials in Beijing in recent days, Huang has secured a major victory for his AI-chip empire.

On Monday, Nvidia announced that the U.S. government will allow it to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The company still needs to secure official licensing approval from the Trump administration, but officials have reportedly assured Nvidia “that licenses will be granted.” The company said in a blog post that it's already filing the necessary applications and plans to begin shipments soon.

The H20 chip is a dialed-down version of Nvidia's powerhouse H100 semiconductor, built specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions. Nvidia is still banned from selling its most advanced chips to China due to national security concerns. The restrictions are also part of a broader effort to maintain America's edge in AI.

Back in April, those curbs tightened even more. After the unexpected success of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, the U.S. halted exports of the modified H20 chips, costing Nvidia potentially billions of dollars in sales. 

But now, it appears all but certain that Huang has managed to convince Trump that selling to China is actually a win for America. According to the company, during Huang's meeting with Trump and other U.S. policymakers, he reaffirmed “NVIDIA's support for the Administration's effort to create jobs, strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and onshore manufacturing, and ensure that America leads in AI worldwide.”

Huang has also made the case that if the future is AI, it's better that it runs on American hardware. 

“General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation,” Huang told reporters in D.C. “We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.”  

This news comes just days after Nvidia made history, becoming the first company ever to reach a $4 trillion market cap. 

Founded in 1993, Nvidia's chips were mostly known for decades for their use in gaming and computer graphics; however, they have now become the backbone in some major tech advances including AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

These victories have also paid off personally for Huang, who is now the eighth-richest person in the world. His fortune has already surpassed that of old-school business titan Warren Buffett and is just $1 billion shy of catching up to internet pioneer Sergey Brin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Mark Zuckerberg Interview Derailed After His Audio Doesn't Work","https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-interview-derailed-after-his-audio-doesnt-work-2000629085","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 13:10:13 GMT","

The debut episode of The Information's video podcast suffered a serious setback this week after an interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to be paused because the podcasters couldn't get the interviewee's audio to work.

The Information, which routinely publishes scoops involving the tech industry, launched TITV this week—an Amazon-sponsored live video program that the outlet describes as “first in tech news and analysis from the people that break and shape the story.”

A key part of the first episode of TITV was a scheduled interview between Zuck and The Information's editor-in-chief, Jessica Lessin. Unfortunately, when Zuckerberg appeared for the interview, the program's audio went dead. Zuck and Lessin could be seen smiling and talking to one another, but not a solitary word reached listeners' ears. Eventually, after 2-3 awkward minutes, the podcast's host, Akash Pasricha, had to enter the fray. “I don't think we have sound,” Pasricha said, continuing: “We're gonna call the show there.”

It's an unfortunate and unceremonious start for the show, which has been teed up as The Information's answer to the influential daily tech news show TBPN. Considering the fact that a subscription to The Information will run you $40 per month, one would think they could afford some AV support.

That said, what Zuckerberg would have really offered conversationally is questionable, since most of the interviews involving him are not particularly interesting beyond the occasional unintentional hilarity. In an interview last year, he offered one bit of levity when he offered an anecdote about shutting down his daughter's dreams of being the next Taylor Swift. He's also well known for a very old interview that mostly involved him sweating profusely.

It makes sense that Zuckerberg would be making public appearances now, as Meta has been quite busy lately. The company is ramping up its AI operations in an effort to better compete with the other major players in the AI space. In addition to launching a new “superintelligence lab” dedicated to advancing the company's automation ambitions, Zuckerberg also recently announced plans to build several multi-gigawatt data centers, which will power the lab. The company also appears to be considering changing its approach and pursuing closed-source programs, as opposed to its open-source LLama programs.

There's reportedly a potential new player in AR glasses, and you'll never guess who it is. I'll give you a hint: they make the app you're about to unconsciously check in about 15 seconds. No, not Tinder; get your mind out of the gutter. I'm talking about TikTok, or more specifically, ByteDance, which owns TikTok and also, according to The Information, which cites sources within the company, has aspirations of entering the burgeoning world of XR hardware. ByteDance's entrant, according to the report, is a pair of goggle-like AR glasses that sit somewhere in between Meta's Quest and Apple's Vision Pro, and I have to say… they sound kind of cool?

According to The Information, the AR goggles, codenamed Phoenix, will have digital passthrough, which is to say, they'll have XR similar to what you might see on a Quest 3, and they'll weigh just 100 grams. That is notably much lighter than the Vision Pro and Meta's Quest 3, which weigh 650 grams and 515 grams, respectively. That smaller form factor will definitely come with some limitations, though. Reducing the weight is all well and good, but it's still hard to miniaturize some of the high-end tech found in headsets like Vision Pro—I can't say for sure, but I wouldn't expect any high-res micro-OLED display here.

That being said, the report says that Phoenix will still borrow some of the capabilities from more premium headsets like the Vision Pro, including a UI that's centered around hand and eye-tracking instead of controllers, just like Apple's visionOS that powers the Vision Pro. While The Information doesn't say anything about price, I'm going to assume that Phoenix, if it ever sees the light of day, will be much cheaper than the Vision Pro, though that's not saying much since Apple's only headset—sorry, “spatial computer”—is still a conversation-ending $3,500. And that last part, if it does pan out to be true, will be very important.

If the report is correct, what we're looking at here is a lightweight AR headset that, yes, may be a little bit dumber than the rest of the pack, but is also a lot more accessible both weight-wise and monetarily. That's basically Meta's playbook with the Quest 3S, which costs just $299 and still does pretty much all of the things you'd want an XR headset to do, just not at a fancy-schmancy Vision Pro level. That lower capability but accessible price and weight strategy has been a fruitful one for Meta. In the first three quarters after its release, Meta sold 3 million Quest 3s while Apple sold just an estimated 370,000 Vision Pros.

And that's not the only Meta product to succeed with that strategy. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, for example, are shells of what competitors like Xreal are putting out—they don't even have displays in them—but they've resonated with people who want something affordable, lightweight, and with just enough features to make the price feel worthwhile. Oh, they also don't make you look like a total dork when you wear them. XR is still a nascent field at the end of the day, so it's too early to prognosticate on whether ByteDance's Phoenix glasses will be any good or anywhere close to successful. As a reality check, ByteDance notably owns the company Pico, which makes VR hardware that has yet to really challenge Meta's Quest dominance. That being said, this is a new product, and ByteDance may nail the strategy with Phoenix. Plus, with TikTok-level resources, it's hard to count anyone out.

Generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok have exploded in popularity as AI becomes mainstream. These tools don't have the ability to make new scientific discoveries on their own, but billionaires are convinced that AI is on the cusp of doing just that. And the latest episode of the All-In podcast helps explain why these guys think AI is extremely close to revolutionizing scientific knowledge.

Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber who no longer works at the company, appeared on All-In to talk with hosts Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya about the future of technology. When the topic turned to AI, Kalanick discussed how he uses xAI's Grok, which went haywire last week, praising Adolf Hitler and advocating for a second Holocaust against Jews.

“I'll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I'll start to get to the edge of what's known in quantum physics and then I'm doing the equivalent of vibe coding, except it's vibe physics,” Kalanick explained. “And we're approaching what's known. And I'm trying to poke and see if there's breakthroughs to be had. And I've gotten pretty damn close to some interesting breakthroughs just doing that.”

The guys on the podcast only briefly addressed Grok's failures without getting into specifics about the MechaHitler debacle, and none of that stopped Kalanick from talking like Grok was this revolutionary tool that was so close to making scientific discoveries in revolutionary ways.

“I pinged Elon on at some point. I'm just like, dude, if I'm doing this and I'm super amateur hour physics enthusiast, like what about all those PhD students and postdocs that are super legit using this tool?” Kalanick said.

Kalanick suggested that what made this even more incredible was that he was using an earlier version of Grok before Grok 4 was released on Wednesday.

“And this is pre-Grok 4. Now with Grok 4, like, there's a lot of mistakes I was seeing Grok make that then I would correct, and we would talk about it. Grok 4 could be this place where breakthroughs are actually happening, new breakthroughs,” Kalanick said.

Calacanis asked Kalanick the obvious question of whether Grok was actually on the verge of a scientific breakthrough. Because anyone who actually understands large language models knows that it can't achieve new ways of thinking. It's just putting together words in the most statistically likely way, forming connections that may sound like a well-thought-out argument but are actually not a form of true “intelligence” as humans would define it.

“Is your perception that the LLMs are actually starting to get to the reasoning level, that they'll come up with a novel concept theory and have that breakthrough? Or that we're kind of reading into it and it's just trying random stuff at the margins?” Calacanis asked.

Kalanick said that he hasn't used Grok 4 because he was having technical difficulties accessing it, suggesting that perhaps a later version of Grok might be capable of such a thing. But he admitted the AI couldn't yet come up with new discoveries.

“No, it cannot come up with the new idea. These things are so wedded to what is known. And they're so like, even when I come up with a new idea, I have to really, it's like pulling a donkey. You see, you're pulling it because it doesn't want to break conventional wisdom. It's like really adhering to conventional wisdom. You're pulling it out and then eventually goes, oh, shit, you got something,” Kalanick said.

Kalanick emphasized that “you have to double and triple check to make sure that you really got something,” making clear he understood that AI chatbots just make things up much of the time. But he still seemed convinced that the thing holding back Grok was “conventional wisdom” rather than the natural limitations of the tech.

Palihapitiya went a step further than Kalanick, insisting that synthetic data could train new AI models.

“When these models are fully divorced from having to learn on the known world and instead can just learn synthetically, then everything gets flipped upside down to what is the best hypothesis you have or what is the best question? You could just give it some problem and it would just figure it out,” said Palihapitiya.

Musk revealed a similar line of thinking recently when he suggested “general artificial intelligence” was close because he had asked Grok “about materials science that are not in any books or on the Internet.” The idea, of course, is that Musk had hit the limits of known science rather than the limit of his scientific understanding. The billionaire really seems convinced that Grok was working on something new.

That was how I felt when asking Grok 4 questions about materials science that are not in any books or on the Internet https://t.co/2wEP3mtD2j

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2025



These guys are hyping up the idea of general artificial intelligence (AGI), which doesn't even have an exact definition. But it's far from the only term getting tossed around right now. AI folks also drop words like “superintelligence” without defining what that means, but it sure keeps the investors intrigued.

These AI chatbots are pulling off a magic trick. They can often seem like they're “thinking” or applying rational thought to a given answer, but they work by spitting out the word that's most likely to be next in a sentence, not by actually applying critical reasoning. There's a reason that people who understand AI the best are the least excited about using it.

Apple has gotten a lot of shit for not committing to AI in a more forceful way, something the All-In guys talked about, but the company understands perhaps better than most that there are limitations to this tech. In fact, Apple released a paper last month that shows how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) struggle, facing “a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities.”

Apple's paper won't dampen the hype, of course. Just about every other major tech company is pushing hard into AI agents and investing billions of dollars into data centers. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Monday that his company was building enormous new data centers to work on superintelligence.

“Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher,” Zuck wrote. “I'm looking forward to working with the top researchers to advance the frontier!”

How do you bury a controversy? If you're Elon Musk, you drop an anime waifu into the middle of a scandal and watch the internet do the rest. Just days after xAI's chatbot Grok sparked outrage for spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric and praising Adolf Hitler, the billionaire shifted the narrative by unveiling a new feature called Companions, which lets users interact with flirty, customizable AI avatars like Ani, a goth anime girl, and Rudy, a red panda. The feature went instantly viral.

While xAI has apologized for Grok's previous behavior, the backlash hadn't fully died down. The timing of this release was telling, and effective. Musk replaced the headlines about Grok's racism with something the internet could meme, argue over, and obsess about. Within 48 hours, the Companions announcement racked up nearly 30 million views on X (formerly Twitter).

The new Companion feature is part of a broader strategic pivot by Musk. While OpenAI and Meta race to make the most powerful language models, xAI is going after emotional engagement.

He hinted that users may soon be able to create their own digital companions with customized voices, appearances, and personalities. “We will make this easier to turn on in a few days,” the CEO of Tesla and founder of xAI and SpaceX said in another post. “Just wanted to do a soft launch to make sure things are stable and working well.”

This marks a shift in the AI wars. Instead of just competing on intelligence or reasoning, Musk wants Grok to feel more personal, more addictive, and more human, or at least more fun. But the reactions online show that people are split.

— DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) July 14, 2025



Musk's most devoted fans (and a likely horde of reply-bots) celebrated the new feature like a tech revelation. “She sounds awesome,” one user replied under the announcement post.

“Currently subscribed to a ton of AI tools: Grok, Claude, Manus, Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, and GitHub Copilot,” another added. “But after putting them all through the wringer, I'm about to hit ‘cancel' on most. I'm keeping Grok – it's smarter, funnier, and way less drama.”

“Cooler than anything,” said a third. “How can I marry Ani?” asked another.

But critics were quick to point out the potential risks, especially for young men.

“This is not going to help the birth rate,” one user warned. “Elon pls no, the birth rate,” echoed another.

Elon pls no, the birthrate

— Reddit Lies (@reddit_lies) July 14, 2025



Musk himself has long voiced concern about declining birth rates in developed countries. Ironically, his own product may now be feeding the problem. When someone replied “gg birthrates,” Musk responded: “Or maybe they get better.”

Or maybe they get better

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 14, 2025



The Companion feature is clearly inspired by waifu culture, a subgenre of anime fandom where fans form emotional or romantic bonds with fictional characters. It has real staying power online, but it's also controversial. Platforms like Replika and Character.ai have long enabled similar AI relationships, with some users reporting deep attachments or even addiction. Now, Musk is bringing that dynamic to a global stage, with meme virality and billionaire marketing power behind it.

And unlike most competitors, Grok Companions live inside X. That makes them not just personal assistants but viral agents of influence. They share memes. They flirt. They build parasocial bonds. And they feed engagement on Musk's struggling social media platform.

Move fast and build things.

Meta is accelerating its investment in the infrastructure it believes will be needed to power the future of artificial intelligence training and inference, with a number of high-capacity, fast-deployment data centers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined plans for gigantic, ""multi-GW clusters"" at truly gargantuan scale, and he's doing it extremely quickly by leveraging a number of cost and time-saving measures inspired by xAI. Meta is also building ""tented"" data centers, rather than traditionally roofed structures.

Deservedly, much has been said about the Meta's talent warsBut underrated is their extensive, vast, and fast moving infrastructure plan. They are moving fast like the early days but at 1000x the scaleSo fast that they are putting GPUs in tents Do you feel the AGI yet anon? https://t.co/Ayk347I4ey pic.twitter.com/TPLuyyrH3RJuly 12, 2025

Even if no one has quite made the AI business model profitable yet, that isn't stopping the world's largest tech companies from investing a collective hundreds of billions of dollars in powering the AI future they are so sure is coming. Alongside Nvidia pushing $500 billion global datacenter investment, and Elon Musk's xAI shipping a power station across the world, Meta is building a number of gigantic datacenters of its own. One of those will reportedly be as large as a sizeable portion of Manhattan.

Although its Llama models might not be capturing the AI zeitgeist like Meta hoped, it may soon be leading the way in domestic AI compute power. Earlier this month, Semi-Analysis reported that Meta will be the first company to build out and deploy a gigawatt-scale datacenter for AI. That will give it over three billion TFLOPS of compute power, we're told. And according to Mark Zuckerberg, this is just the beginning.



The 1GW ""Prometheus"" datacenter will come online in 2026, but Meta is also building ""Hyperion,"" he said, which will take a few years to build up to scale and will eventually require as much as 5GW of power. Meta is also working on several other data centers in the longer term, and each of these ""titan clusters"" could be as large as a sizeable portion of Manhattan.



The self-styled ""Zuck"" went on to say that ""Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher,"" which may hint at the business model Meta is targeting. If it can't build the AI itself, perhaps it could join Amazon and other entities, like Groq, in providing the infrastructure to power it.

That competition will mean Meta needs to scale up fast if it wants to be competitive, and that seems to be exactly what it's doing. Semi-Analysis detailed how Meta has reinvented its datacenter strategy about building them with AI in mind. Meta will reportedly use a new ""tent"" style of structure that is faster to build and has less redundancy to further increase the pace of deployment. Where traditional data centers have backup diesel generators should they encounter a power outage, the new Meta sites will do away with that entirely.

They will also leverage pre-fabricated power and cooling modules and will draw power from on-site meta substations, with smart workload management tools helping to maximize the power available to each datacenter. That can also include on-site natural gas generation, too, with Meta already building two 200MW natural gas plants in Ohio.

""We were recently informed by the Department of Commerce that license applications to export MI308 products to China will be moving forward for review""

Just hours after Nvidia announced that the sale of H20 chips in China is set to be approved by Washington, AMD has now confirmed it also plans to resume shipments of its MI308 chips in the country, following a similar shift by the administration. The company confirmed to Tom's Hardware that its license applications to export the chip will be moving forward for review, with the implied understanding that they will be granted.

As noted, the news follows the revelation that Nvidia will resume the sale of its H20 chips in China. AMD says it was recently informed by the Department of Commerce that its license applications to export MI308 would be going ahead, and says it ""plans to resume shipments as licenses are approved."" In a statement, the company further noted, ""We applaud the progress made by the Trump Administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership.""

As with Nvidia, AMD has chafed under restrictions on AI hardware export restrictions put forward by both the previous Biden administration and the current Trump administration. The former introduced a blanket AI diffusion rule; the latter, while reversing AI diffusion, placed specific restrictions on the H20 and MI308 chips.

AMD confirmed at the time that the measures could cost it in the region of $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. While not quite the $5.5 billion write-off suffered by Nvidia, that's enough to hurt anyone's bottom line, making today's shift in policy a welcome break for Team Red.

AMD shares have surged by nearly 5% in pre-market trading following the news, a similar jump to Nvidia, as shareholders welcome the development.

The overturning of the specific bans on the H20 and MI308 chips marks a seismic policy shift within Washington, following months of protracted back-and-forth. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been a notable detractor of such measures, calling export control a failure and praising President Trump's move to roll back the AI diffusion rule. Huang has repeatedly stated that export controls could limit U.S. power in the advancing world of AI and force countries like China to look inward for innovation and alternative hardware solutions, possibly buoying the country's efforts rather than stalling them.

Most recently, he downplayed concerns that China's military could use U.S. AI tech and stated, ""Just like we want the world to be built on the American dollar, using the American dollar as the global standard, we want the American tech stack to be the global standard."" He reiterated that in order for America to have AI leadership,"" it needs to make sure the American tech stack is available to markets all over the world.""

Snazzy Labs' Quinn Nelson has fallen foul of Nintendo's aggressive anti-piracy measures

A Switch 2 owner has had their console “restricted by Nintendo” after installing a Switch game they bought on the used market. Quinn Nelson, the creator behind popular YouTube channel Snazzy Labs, fell foul to the long arm of Nintendo law, and now assumes the “old copy of Bayo 3 on eBay” they bought must have been dumped/ripped by its previous owner and got flagged by big N's anti-piracy servers.

PSA: be EXTREMELY careful buying used Nintendo Switch games. Bought an old copy of Bayo 3 on eBay and WELP, my 1-month-old $450 Switch 2 is BANNED.This cart must have been dumped by whoever owned it before me.Hoping Nintendo will understand/unlock for me, else, this SUCKS! pic.twitter.com/ev0VXNVQU6July 15, 2025

Nelson kindly posted the above warning as a PSA (public service announcement) for other Switch 2 owners who may be considering building their game library via the used market. “Be EXTREMELY careful buying used Nintendo Switch games,” they stress. Nintendo's action, represented by the screen, doesn't just disable access to the possibly duped and redistributed copy of Bayo 3. All access to Nintendo's online services have been cut off.

The above foreboding message effectively signals a ban on the particular console from online services operated by Nintendo. The move isn't tied to the user account, but Nelson's “1-month-old $450 Switch 2 is BANNED” from a lot of the online fun available. To be clear, if this happens to you, the physical cartridges that you own will remain playable, without updates, and some previously downloaded digital games may remain accessible.

Other social media users were quick to reassure Nelson of two things. Firstly, hardware bans received for using second-hand game carts that have been cloned by tools like MIG Flash are not uncommon. And, probably more importantly, Nintendo is receptive to owners who can provide corroborating evidence that they are innocent of Nintendo-flavored piracy. We reported on exactly such a case, only last week, with a happy ending for the innocent Facebook Marketplace-sourced used-game buyer.

All that seems to be required to iron out this digital wrinkle is some online correspondence with Nintendo and some kind of paper trail (or screenshots) showing that the offending game cart was bought used without any awareness of bad provenance.

Not all social media responses to Nelson's situation were supportive, though – this is X in 2025., afterall A particular point was raised by Centro LEAKS, a Pokémon leaks, rumors and news site, which highlighted Nelson's previous posts, one mentioning that he intended to run “my MIG Flash game dumps” on the Switch 2.

Hope my Switch 2 continues to work with my MIG Flash game dumps. This is the best way to carry all of your physical games all at once without risking a ban on an unmodded console. pic.twitter.com/dTl711noeJApril 5, 2025

Nelson clarified in that referenced Tweet that he used the flash cart to vastly improve the portability of a large game collection. Moreover, he informed commentators and critics at the time that ""You get banned if you play pirated copies. Not your own,"" implying he doesn't think the ban is related to this activity.

Taking Nelson's claims at face value, let's hope they get their Switch 2 back online shortly. Having an almost new console restricted and locked down like this, while being innocent of any piracy, would definitely not be fair.

Security researchers warn of persistent firmware threats affecting hundreds of models.



When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Firmware security research company Binarly has discovered four new vulnerabilities affecting the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) on multiple Gigabyte motherboards. The vulnerabilities with CVE identifiers CVE-2025-7029, CVE-2025-7028, CVE-2025-7027, and CVE-2025-7026 were shared with Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) for further analysis.

The cause of concern is said to lie within the System Management Mode (SMM), a high-privilege operating mode on x86 processors meant for low-level system management tasks. SMM grants UEFI access to the system hardware, where all the code is executed in a secure memory area called System Management RAM (SMRAM). This memory can only be accessed using Special System Management Interrupt (SMI) handlers, which rely on specific communication buffers to process data. However, in case these handlers do not validate the data, it can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code before the operating system is loaded.

CVE Identifier

Description

CVSS score

Severity

CVE-2025-7029

Unchecked RBX register enables arbitrary SMRAM writes via OcHeader/OcData pointers

8.2 

High

CVE-2025-7028

Unvalidated function pointers allow attacker control over flash operations

8.2 

High

CVE-2025-7027

Double pointer dereference enables arbitrary SMRAM writes

8.2

High

CVE-2025-7026

Unchecked RBX register allows arbitrary SMRAM writes in CommandRcx0

8.2

High

As per CERT's report, an attacker with administrative access could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code in SMM and bypass key UEFI protections, including Secure Boot. The attacker can also install ""stealthy firmware implants"" and take long-term control of the system. These attacks can be triggered from inside the OS or during early boot, sleep, or recovery states. Since SMM operates below the OS kernel, it can be hard to spot or disable the vulnerability using traditional security tools.

Gigabyte is already rolling out firmware updates for many of the affected models. As per the latest security advisory, the company has shared a list of impacted products and corresponding BIOS versions, which includes a large number of Gigabyte motherboard models across the Intel 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 series platforms.

Binarly has confirmed to Bleeping Computers that over a hundred product lines are potentially at risk, including various revisions and region-specific models. Users are encouraged to visit Gigabyte's official support page to identify their motherboard model and download the latest BIOS/UEFI firmware. The update can be installed via Gigabyte's BIOS or using the Q-Flash utility. It is also critical to double-check the BIOS settings after updating to the latest firmware to ensure Secure Boot is enabled. While there's currently no evidence whether these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, the discovery throws light on the growing threat of firmware-level attacks.

The H20 taps are open once again.

The White House plans to allow Nvidia to sell its H20 AI GPUs to China once again, signaling a significant victory for the company after it suffered a $5.5-billion write-off when they were banned for export to China in mid-April. The company confirmed to Tom's Hardware that “The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.”

The company announced the China-specific H20 AI GPUs in late 2023 after Washington banned its most advanced H100 and H200 models for export to China. However, the Biden Administration's AI diffusion rule, and then more targeted measures from the Trump administration, threatened to ban even these defanged GPUs, which were still quite popular among Chinese customers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly spent $1 million on a dinner with the president to have the plan suspended, but the White House banned their export a week later anyway, a measure affecting both the Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 AI chips.

Jensen Huang has been vocal against the ban that the U.S. is placing on advanced AI chips, an area dominated by his company. The CEO has said many times that AI chip export control is a failure and that the Chinese military will avoid American tech for its development. Instead of limiting who has access to its technology, he says that it should do the opposite and allow American AI tech to spread far and wide — or else it risks losing the lead to its Chinese competitors like Huawei.

H20 export license approvals resumed a month after the U.S. and China negotiated a preliminary trade deal amid prolonged tariff tensions. Some of the developments between the nations include the resumption of rare earth metal exports to the U.S. in exchange for the lifting of the EDA export control. Nvidia says that CEO Jensen Huang has been flying between Washington, D.C., and Beijing, meeting with officials and policymakers to emphasize “the benefits that AI will bring to business and society worldwide.” It seems that his lobbying between the two parties has been successful with this approval, although we won't know for sure until the licenses are officially granted. Nvidia will be hopeful it can resume H20 sales without a hitch.

We should note, though, that this doesn't appear to be a blanket lifting of the ban — instead, it's just a promise that Washington will start approving export licenses for the H20 GPU. It's likely for this reason that the company announced the fully compliant Nvidia RTX Pro GPU, which “is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics.” The company was also reportedly preparing a cut-down HGX H20 GPU in response to the original ban, which wouldn't have any sort of restriction placed on it.

Washington  Castilhos

Popular among bodybuilders, creatine supplementation is gaining traction for its potential use beyond athletic performance. Researchers are exploring its clinical role in managing muscular and neurologic disorders, as well as its application in geriatric care. But what evidence supports these broader uses? When is creatine appropriate to recommend, at what doses, and are there contraindications? Medscape's Portuguese edition spoke with several experts to examine how creatine supplementation may benefit patients in clinical practice.

Like endogenous creatine, supplemental creatine is converted into phosphocreatine and stored in skeletal muscle, where it plays a critical role in rapid adenosine triphosphate (ATP) replenishment. “Supplementation helps accelerate muscle recovery by providing an available energy reserve,” explained Beatriz Leite, clinical nutritionist with a PhD in health sciences from the Federal University of São Paulo and a member of the Multiprofessional Committee of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology, São Paulo, Brazil.

The body naturally synthesizes around 1-2 g of creatine daily, and the compound is also present in animal-derived foods. About 1 kg of red meat contains roughly 5 g of creatine — so a 200-g serving provides about 1 g. The typical supplementation dose, ranging from 3 to 5 g/d, is designed to complement both endogenous production and dietary intake to support intramuscular creatine accumulation.

A recent meta-analysis of 685 clinical trials concluded that creatine supplementation is not linked to clinically significant adverse effects and is generally well tolerated — particularly at recommended doses of 3-5 g/d or 0.1 g/kg/d. “Creatine monohydrate is essentially identical to what the body produces. It's metabolized the same way, and I see no meaningful risk of side effects. It's a very safe supplement,” said Andréa Fioretti, head of the Department of Sports and Exercise Endocrinology at the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism.

Concerns have lingered about creatine's potential to elevate serum creatinine levels and place strain on liver or kidney function. However, a meta-analysis indicates that creatine does not significantly alter serum creatinine. “Creatine is excreted by the kidneys as creatinine. So when a patient supplements with creatine, the apparent rise in serum creatinine is usually a false signal — not an indicator of renal damage,” Fioretti explained.

Supporting this, a study from the University of São Paulo found that creatine supplementation actually reduced levels of cystatin C, further reinforcing the absence of renal harm.

Nonetheless, Leite advised individualized assessment. “In patients with renal or hepatic conditions, more careful evaluation is essential. Supplementation should only be considered if there's a clear therapeutic benefit,” she noted.

Gustavo Starling Torres, MD, sports medicine physician and director at the Brazilian Society of Exercise and Sports Medicine, agreed: “The supplementation protocol should always be individualized, taking into account therapeutic goals, patient tolerance, and overall clinical condition.”

In such cases, renal function testing may be advisable. “If there's concern about kidney function, a creatinine test can help guide decisions,” said Fioretti. “This ensures the supplement is used in patients who genuinely need it — those with muscle mass deficiencies.”

Michele Trindade, PhD, adjunct professor in the Department of Physical Education at the State University of Maringá in Maringá, Brazil, and vice president of the Brazilian Association of Sports Nutrition, also advised caution when considering creatine supplementation in pregnant or breastfeeding women and in children. “They're not currently included in official recommendations because there's insufficient safety and efficacy data for pregnant individuals and fetuses. We also don't yet know how much transfers into breast milk,” she explained.

Regarding children, Trindade added that creatine is not recommended — even in cases of malnutrition. “When treating a malnourished child, the priority is nutritional rehabilitation. Malnutrition involves more than loss of muscle mass; it includes deficiencies in total caloric intake and essential micronutrients like vitamins and minerals that regulate metabolic function.”

Like skeletal muscle, the brain depends on the rapid ATP regeneration provided by the creatine-phosphocreatine system, raising interest in its possible neurologic benefits. A systematic review in healthy older adults suggested that “oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals, but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear, leaving questions around ideal dosing and the mechanisms underlying potential cognitive enhancement.”

Another review exploring creatine's potential in neurologic conditions noted that while early human studies — particularly in neurodegenerative diseases — are promising, more robust evidence is needed. Well-designed, long-term randomized controlled trials are essential to establish efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety in these populations.

Creatine has also been studied as an adjunctive therapy for conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and certain metabolic myopathies. However, the available data remain inconclusive. In the context of muscle disorders, a systematic review observed that creatine monohydrate may help reduce intracellular calcium accumulation and provide energy for muscle contraction, though the optimal dosing and magnitude of effect are still unclear.

In a study involving 107 patients with probable or confirmed ALS, daily creatine monohydrate was well tolerated and associated with a trend toward increased survival — mirroring findings from an earlier trial. However, the authors concluded that supplementation at 5 g/d did not significantly improve markers of disease progression or reduce fatigue during isometric contraction, despite anecdotal reports from participants.

Findings on creatine supplementation in older adults remain mixed. “Evidence is very limited in this population. Few studies have demonstrated improvements in physical performance or muscle strength,” said Ivan Aprahamian, MD, PhD, internal medicine and geriatrics specialist and a member of the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology.

Aprahamian noted that creatine may serve as a helpful adjunct in managing sarcopenia. “In older adults with reduced muscle mass or strength who are engaged in resistance training, creatine may support improvements in muscle health,” he explained. The recommended dosage remains 3-5 g/d, taken consistently.

In such cases, Fioretti recommended first screening for sarcopenia using the SARC-F questionnaire — which assesses autonomy and independence — alongside grip strength testing. “If reduced strength is confirmed, further evaluation of muscle mass using bioimpedance or DEXA, followed by a physical performance assessment, is warranted,” she said.

On the basis of results, a resistance training program can be initiated in combination with creatine supplementation and appropriate carbohydrate and protein intake. “Older adults often consume excessive carbohydrates and insufficient protein. After approximately 6 months, it's advisable to repeat assessments to monitor improvements in muscle mass and physical function,” Fioretti added.

Leite agreed: “Creatine is not a miracle solution. It must be combined with a well-structured dietary plan.” Even in sedentary seniors, she noted, supplementation may still offer benefits. “While it may not significantly increase muscle mass, it can help reduce the rate of muscle loss,” she explained.

For physically inactive older adults, the standard dose of 3-5 g/d is still recommended. “This may support musculoskeletal health, though the effect on strength is modest,” said Trindade, who also cautioned that responses may vary by sex. Limited data suggest that women — who typically have higher baseline intramuscular creatine levels — may be less responsive to supplementation. “We don't fully understand why, but it's likely related to hormonal differences.”

Despite a growing number of hypotheses, robust evidence currently supports creatine supplementation primarily in the context of sports medicine. Misconceptions persist — particularly the belief that creatine directly causes muscle hypertrophy. “In high-intensity, short-duration resistance training, where energy reserves are quickly depleted, creatine helps by rapidly replenishing ATP. This indirectly supports muscle hypertrophy,” explained Leite.

In athletic settings, creatine can be taken either before or after exercise, with comparable benefits. “Scientific literature shows that timing matters less than consistency. Regular use is key to saturating muscle creatine stores,” said Torres.

Creatine's effect is cumulative. “What matters is the total amount stored in muscle,” noted Trindade. “After ingesting monohydrate, blood levels peak at around an hour, and the creatine is distributed to muscles that haven't yet reached storage capacity. Once saturated, muscles rely on these reserves.”

For fitness professionals, the benefits are often seen in practice. “Among clients who take creatine after workouts, I've observed better lean mass gains — which is often their primary goal,” said Celina Moreno, a trainer since the 1970s who witnessed the early rise of powdered supplements in gyms.

Alexandre Pereira da Costa Filho, who works at a chain of fitness centers, takes 9 g of creatine before bed — about 0.1 g/kg/d for his 86 kg body weight. He cautioned that loading protocols involving high initial doses followed by lower maintenance levels should be guided by a professional. “Only do this under the supervision of a nutritionist. Always consult a qualified professional before making decisions,” he advised.

For those seeking faster performance gains, Trindade recommended a loading phase: 20 g/d, divided into four doses, for 5 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 3-5 g/d.

However, this protocol may cause fluid retention and modest weight gain. “Most people don't notice it, but it depends on whether they're exercising enough to compensate,” added Fioretti.

In April, Brazil's national health regulatory agency, Anvisa, published an analysis of 41 creatine supplements from 29 manufacturers. Only one product had an incorrect concentration, but 40 showed labeling discrepancies. “Some products may contain less creatine than declared — or even contaminants, especially when unregulated,” warned Torres. He advised choosing certified products to minimize risk.

In adults with obesity who were prescribed semaglutide, older age and female sex were associated with greater muscle loss, whereas a higher protein intake appeared to be protective against this loss. Greater muscle loss was independently linked to diminished glycemic benefits of the drug.

Despite patients sharing a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on lung CT scans, patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) demonstrated a slower decline in lung function and longer transplant-free survival than those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, varying results were reported for those with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (FHP).

“Our findings may have important clinical implications and argue against extrapolating clinical outcomes of IPF to other ILDs with a UIP CT pattern, particularly when estimating prognosis or devising management plans,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by John S. Kim, MD, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia. It was published online on June 8, 2025 in Thorax.

The PFF-PR cohort had a considerably smaller FHP-UIP subgroup, potentially limiting the statistical power for FHP analyses. The research cohorts had uneven proportions of patients with ILD subtypes, potentially affecting the replication of the findings. Most participants self-identified as White individuals and were from the US, introducing potential selection bias and limiting generalizability.

The study did not receive any specific funding. The lead author was supported by grants from the National Institute of Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Multiple authors disclosed receiving consulting fees, speaker honoraria, personal fees, grants, and research support from and having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche/Genentech, and others.

Nine percent of physician assistants (PAs) surveyed by Medscape are represented at work by a union or collective bargaining unit. Among those who aren't represented now, 7% of PAs told Medscape that either a formal organizing effort was under way, or unionization was being discussed. With that backdrop, about 2 of 3 PAs in the survey said their peers have middle-of-the-road attitudes about PAs.

This infographic presents key findings from a new report assessing labor unions' efforts to represent PAs. To learn more, check out the Medscape Physician Assistants and Unions Report 2025.

In-hospital silent asymptomatic graft occlusion following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was associated with an increased incidence of angina-related rehospitalisations and reinterventions after 1 year of follow-up.

""Our findings support the routine use of postoperative cCT [coronary CT] angiography to identify silent graft occlusions, which are frequently underdiagnosed with symptom-driven follow-up alone; early detection enables tailored risk stratification, facilitates ischaemia testing when indicated and informs closer surveillance rather than reflexive intervention,"" the researchers noted.

This study was led by Islam Salikhanov, MD, PhD, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. It was published online on July 07, 2025, in Open Heart.

This study was conducted at a single centre. The incidence of silent graft occlusion was 8.5%, which limited the statistical power for subgroup analyses. The exclusion of patients with severe renal issues or iodine-contrast allergies limited the generalisability of the findings.

This study received funding from the Immanuel and Ilse Straub Foundation. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

More than one in five trainee doctors in the UK hesitate to escalate concerns about a patient's condition, according to the latest General Medical Council (GMC) national training survey.

This figure rose to nearly one in three among trainees in high-pressure specialties, including surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, general medicine, and emergency medicine. These groups also reported the highest levels of stress, bullying, and incivility.

New for 2024, the GMC asked trainees if they ever felt apprehensive about escalating care to a senior colleague. Among those who reported hesitancy:

Professor Pushpinder Mangat, medical director at the GMC, said: “These findings are extremely concerning. Doctors need to feel comfortable escalating concerns. When they don't, there are potentially serious risks to patient safety.”

Burnout levels remain high, with one in five trainees at high risk — double the rate reported in 2019, though slightly down from 2023.

Burnout varied significantly by specialty — from 30% in emergency medicine to just 4% in public health. Half of the cohort said that they found their work emotionally exhausting to a high or very high degree.

Among trainers, 11% were at high risk of burnout, and 36% at moderate risk. Despite this, 90% said they enjoyed their role, and 70% rated the support they received as either good or very good.

The GMC received responses from 50,637 trainees and 21,289 trainers. Among trainees:

However, concerns persisted: 

The survey also found continuing problems due to rota gaps, with 26% saying their training had been affected because these gaps are not being dealt with effectively. The GMC said it is “vital” that trusts and boards address the issue.

The report noted a steady increase over recent years in the proportion of trainees working less than full time, which now involved 30% of female and 15% of male trainees.

There was also “notable variation” between specialties, with 46% of paediatrics and child health trainees training less than full time, compared with just 8% of those in surgery posts. 

Those rating their workload as heavy or very heavy (42% overall) ranged from 70% in emergency medicine to 19% in public health.

Of those who worked less than full-time, or had considered or applied to do so, 66% sought a better work-life balance and 44% cited childcare responsibilities.

The GMC called for flexible training models to create a sustainable workforce and safe patient care. It was “clear that medical education and training needs to adapt,” it said.

Clinical Review

The novel Tumor Profiler (TuPro) project, which analyzed melanoma samples using nine independent technologies, demonstrated feasibility in guiding treatment decisions. Molecular tumor board recommendations on the basis of TuPro were deemed useful in 75% of cases.

“This study demonstrates the feasibility of using advanced multiomics approaches, including spatial proteomics, to guide therapy decisions in late-stage melanoma — one of the most aggressive and treatment-resistant cancers — with a reproducible patient benefit,” said Stéphane Chevrier, PhD, CSO, and cofounder of Navignostics and contributor to the TuPro study, in a press release. “This is a major step toward pan-cancer diagnostics. By providing a comprehensive view of the tumor biology, the approach could eventually identify features that are predictive for treatments across cancer indications.”

The study, led by Nicola Miglino, the University of Zurich and University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland, was published online in Nature Medicine.

The current approach of selecting markers for treatment decisions by human experts did not capture all potentially relevant information. The retrospective comparison between TuPro and non-TuPro cohorts limited extrapolation and generalizability of the results. Additionally, definitive conclusions about the clinical value of serial sampling cannot be drawn owing to heterogeneous results and a small sample size.

The study received an open-access funding from the University of Zurich. Several authors reported having advisory roles or receiving research funding and having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

SAN FRANCISCO — A new joint clinical practice guideline (CPG) from two endocrinology societies addresses managing preexisting diabetes and pregnancy, starting with a call to screen for pregnancy intention at every clinical encounter.

“The lack of preconception care for patients with preexisting diabetes is a major focus of this guideline. We know from strong meta-analyses that there is a significant reduction in poor pregnancy outcomes with good preconception care ahead of time. There's a 71% reduction in congenital malformations and reductions in perinatal mortality as well as other negative outcomes. And so, it's really important to have preconception care,” Jennifer A. Wyckoff, MD, CPG writing chair and clinical professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, told Medscape Medical News.

“Preexisting Diabetes and Pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology Joint Clinical Practice Guideline” was presented on July 13, 2025, at ENDO 2025: The Endocrine Society Annual Meeting, and was simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

Cosponsoring the CPG are the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, the American Pharmacists Association, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. It is supported by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, while the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was a participating organization.

The CPG provides 10 clinical recommendations, covering preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum care for women with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). It was written by a multidisciplinary panel working with a noteworthy absence of data in most areas.

“There are not a lot of randomized controlled trials in diabetes in pregnancy, so there's not a lot of high-quality data. For this particular guideline, there are no strong recommendations. There are only conditional recommendations worded as ‘suggestions.'…This serves to highlight some of the areas where research is most needed,” said Wyckoff.

The CPG makes the following conditional recommendations:

The recommendation regarding consumption of > 175 g or < 175 g of carbohydrates per day was made as an “either/or” due to inadequate evidence for or against.

“We had very little data on nutrition…There are data suggesting that extremes of carbohydrate intake, either far too much carbohydrate or far too little carbohydrate, are detrimental. Less than 100 grams of carbs a day would be detrimental. But there is nothing to really clarify what the correct amount should be. It's quite complex, because it also depends on the individual woman, on her BMI, activity level, and other macronutrients in her diet,” Wyckoff told Medscape Medical News.

Asked to comment, Camille E. Powe, MD, co-director of Diabetes in Pregnancy Programs at Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts General Brigham, Boston, told Medscape Medical News, “The Endocrine Society guideline answered 10 specific important questions for the management of preexisting diabetes in pregnancy, some of which are very controversial and things that clinicians really want to know about. I applaud them for addressing the questions very specifically, with rigor and evidence.” 

Powe, who works with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in several capacities related to diabetes in pregnancy but was not officially speaking for the ADA, noted that this CPG generally aligns with the ADA's guidance on preexisting diabetes in pregnancy published as a section of its annual Standards of Care, although the CPG goes into more detail with some of the specific recommendations.

“Historically, pregnant women have not been included in clinical research, and we are still dealing with the implications of that. It's done for good intentions, but I think the unintended consequences of not including pregnant and lactating women in research is that then we have less of an evidence base for which we can treat our pregnant and lactating patients,” Powe noted.

She said the writing panel's inability to make strong recommendations “speaks to the incredible need for high-quality evidence generation in pregnancy and postpartum for those living with diabetes. It's really a call to action for scientists, investigators, physicians, funders, and industry partners to do this work because we really should have the evidence in women's health research to support high-quality care of people with diabetes in pregnancy.”

Wyckoff reported having no disclosures. Powe is an associate editor for the ADA journal Diabetes Care and received research support from Dexcom.

Stocking and restocking anesthesia carts is tedious and meticulous — and it's highly regulated. Anesthesiologists have direct and extensive access to controlled drugs in a hospital setting, particularly potent opioids and sedatives, which makes these processes vulnerable to the potential of abuse.

Within the anesthesia ecosystem, the doctor has a partner in the stocking and restocking process, and that's the hospital pharmacy staff. This team has so much reporting to do: logging which medications were used by which operating teams and on which patients — data that ultimately get reported to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Errors in any part of the dispensing, stocking, and securing process could result in waste, fines, medication errors, or worse.

Hospitals have been on the search for help. Several companies have focused on what's called RAIN RFID. The technology uses passive ultrahigh frequency waves to essentially perform the function of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for short-range device communication. It's available to hospitals to help with everything from patient tracking to equipment security and compliance.

For anesthesia departments, the company Intelliguard created what it calls the Mira Ecosystem. It's built on RAIN RFID and monitors each vial of medication through its entire journey, filling clinical, compliance, and supply chain functions.

According to Intelliguard, about 90% of its systems are currently deployed to serve anesthesia departments. When vials of medication arrive at the pharmacy, a technician applies the Mira tag to each vial, and immediately, the system begins tracking each individual one.

“Our system reads each of the 96-bit unique IDs and then associates those unique IDs with the medication. So now each of those IDs is associated with rocuronium, for example, and the company that made it, the serial number, and the expiration and the lot number,” said Paul Elizondo, Intelliguard's chief innovation officer. “From then on, when our system sees that 96-bit unique ID, it associates it with the medication in a database. It displays that on the screen, and we know exactly what that medication is now.”

The system tracks each vial of medication throughout its journey at the hospital, giving pharmacy managers and hospital administrators instant, real-time visibility into where each vial is and when. In terms of daily pharmacy tasks, making up medication trays for anesthesiologists is made nearly foolproof, reducing medication errors.

“The hospitals using our system will place these RFID-tagged medications into the tray, then they will place that tray into our enclosure,” said Elizondo. “In 6 seconds, we read every single tag in that tray, and we let them know if that formula, if what's in the tray, matches the formulary to which they're building right at that time.”

The system can also check to ensure there are no expired or recalled medications in the tray. The real-time savings come, though, when the anesthesiologist returns the tray at the end of the day.

Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego is using this system. Performance improvement pharmacist Ann McKinstry explained some of the ways that she's seen return on investment gains.

“Pinpointing the medication location has allowed for a more rapid response to expiry, recalls, and patient care events,” McKinstry said. “Inpatient pharmacy inventory is tightened by offering a streamlined data review to analyze usage and reducing waste by tightening supply on hand. In addition, RFID tags allow accurate controlled substance reconciliation by monitoring usage, waste, and replenishment down to the minute.”

Knowing exactly where your medications are on a real-time basis isn't just important: It can be a matter of life and limb. For example, if a patient with a deadly North American pit viper bite is rolled into your emergency department, as happened at a Bartow, Florida hospital at 1 AM on May 4 — you'd definitely want to know if you have antivenom on hand.

Bartow was out. They reached out to Prodigy Health, distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals that supplies medicines to hospitals on a consignment basis. Prodigy runs a 24-hour switchboard and uses RAIN to gain visibility into what is being dispensed by each hospital. The antivenom was quickly located at a hospital in Lutz, Florida, one that had a RAIN RFID cabinet. The request was made, the antivenom was transferred, and the day was saved.

Before this technology, “This process was manual and time-consuming. Now, with reliable data integrating into our system every 6 seconds, we're able to provide immediate, confident answers to customer inquiries about medication availability and delivery timelines,” said Ty Dishman, CEO of Prodigy Health. “Instead of saying, ‘I think it's there — let me check and call you back,' we can act quickly and efficiently, ensuring life-saving medications are mobilized without delay.”

RFID systems are nothing new in the healthcare environment. They're commonly used to track medical equipment and inventory, as well as in staff badging systems. Its use in medication management is fairly recent.

Terso Solutions offers a similar suite to the Mira Ecosystem, with the exception of Intelliguard's direct-to-operating room tray system; Avery Dennison Medical and Healthcare provides a wide range of pharmaceutical labeling options, and some options include RFID.

Patients with giant cell arteritis started tocilizumab therapy an average of 43 days after diagnosis, partly because of delays in insurance approval.

“During the study period, there was only one FDA-approved medication for GCA [giant cell arteritis], yet the high cost and delays to medication start remained high. Understanding the delays, costs, and factors that prevent timely therapy is critical to rheumatologic and geriatric care,” the authors of the study wrote.

“[T]he results offer important insights into the administrative and financial frustrations related to securing biologic approval and coverage, which has been documented in other conditions,” experts wrote in an editorial.

This study was led by Dominique Feterman Jimenez, MD, University of Washington. It was published online on March 15, 2025, in The Journal of Rheumatology.

The single-center design may limit the generalizability of the findings beyond Washington State because insurance plans vary by state. The predominance of patients with Medicare may also limit applicability of the findings. The small sample size restricted the ability to analyze differences among various Medicare supplemental plans.

One author disclosed receiving support from a Rheumatology Research Foundation Investigator Award. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Early pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) using modern surgical tools demonstrated promising outcomes in patients who developed endophthalmitis after cataract surgery or intravitreal injection. Most regained the clarity of vision they had before the infection, researchers found.

“The vitreoretinal surgical techniques have greatly improved with smaller gauge and better instruments, more sophisticated vitrectomy machines, and better illumination systems. These technical advances have made vitrectomy a much safer and more standardized operation,” the researchers of the study wrote. “The implication of this study is that early PPV should be considered for all cases of endophthalmitis, regardless of initial” visual acuity, they added.

The study was led by Julian W. Sromicki, MD, of the Department of Ophthalmology at University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. It was published online on July 9, 2025, in Ophthalmology and Therapy.

Because of the retrospective nature of this study, researchers could not conclude if PPV caused improvement in visual outcomes. The causes of postoperative complications were not systematically analyzed, making it unclear whether complications were due primarily to the surgical intervention or the severity of the underlying infection. The potential impact of variability due to surgeons was not considered, which may have introduced bias and affected the reliability and generalizability of the findings.

The authors declared having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Bariatric surgery is a powerful tool for long-term weight loss, but it requires lifelong commitment to healthy eating, physical activity, supplements, and behavior change. 

When should you refer for bariatric surgery? The 2019 AACE/TOS/ASMBS guidelines recommend considering surgery for individuals with a BMI over 35 and at least one obesity-related condition — like type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, or hypertension — or anyone with a BMI over 40.They also note that patients with a BMI from 30 to 34.9 and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may be considered. 

The updated 2022 ASMBS guidelines recommend expanding eligibility to include a BMI over 30with weight-related conditions, especially for Asian populations who experience metabolic risk at lower BMIs.However, most insurance plans still only cover surgery for a BMI over 35 with associated conditions or a BMI over 40. 

Because long-term weight loss is difficult due to biologic adaptations, I offer surgery as an option to all eligible patients so they can make an informed choice. Surgery may be especially appropriate for patients who prefer surgery over lifelong obesity medications — though they'll still need lifelong vitamin supplementation — those who have not achieved long-term success with lifestyle interventions and/or obesity medications, or those who have higher BMI, for whom obesity medications and lifestyle modifications may not be sufficient to lead to resolution of weight-related complications. 

Importantly, this does not have to be an either/or decision.Many patients benefit from a combination of bariatric surgery and obesity medications to achieve meaningful, lasting weight loss and improvements in health. As always, shared decision making is key, including a clear discussion of risks, benefits, alternatives, and patient goals.

Death from pneumonic plague was confirmed in a resident of Coconino County, Arizona, on July 11, 2025, according to a press release from the county's health and human services department. 

Although plague is rare in humans, it is endemic in the southwestern United States, and Coconino County Health and Human Services (CCHHS) maintains surveillance for the disease, according to the press release. 

""The source of the exposure is still under investigation; however, the death is not related to a recent report of a prairie dog die-off in the Townsend Winona area, northeast of Flagstaff,"" a media spokesperson from CCHHS told Medscape Medical News. 

Prairie dogs are highly susceptible to plague but tend to die off quickly after an infection; they serve as an indicator species for the presence of plague, but not as long-term disease vectors, according to the press release. Plague was not found to be present in the prairie dog colony with the recent die-off, the spokesperson added. 

The bacterium Yersinia pestis, the source of plague, originates in fleas and is transmissible to animals or humans through a bite from an infected flea, according to the CDC. Humans can get plague from handling infected animals as well. Plague cycles naturally among rodents in the wild, such as prairie dogs, but plague caused by bites is more likely to be bubonic plague or septicemic plague, according to the CDC. Pneumonic plague is spread by inhalation of bacteria-containing droplets and affects the lungs. 

Notably, cats are highly susceptible to plague and can become infected by eating infected rodents, as well as from flea bites, according to the CDC. Cats with plague pose a risk of transmitting infectious plague droplets resulting in pneumonic plague to their owners or to veterinarians, according to the CDC. 

In humans, plague symptoms usually appear within about a week of exposure and may include chills and fever, headache, weakness, and muscle pain, as well as swollen lymph nodes in some cases, according to the CCHHS press release. 

Although the public health risk for plague remains low, Arizona public health officials recommend standard precautions such as avoiding contact with wild animals and fleas and seeking prompt veterinary care for sick pets. Officials also recommend removing piles of brush, rocks, trash, or lumber from homes and outbuildings because these could promote rodent infestations.

Researchers analyzed 134,663 nicotine ingestions among children younger than 6 years, finding that nicotine pouch ingestions increased by more than 760% from 2020 to 2023. Nicotine pouches were 1.5 times more likely to cause serious medical outcomes and twice as likely to require medical admission than other nicotine formulations.

“Study findings, including the emergence and comparative severity of nicotine pouch ingestions, support the need for ongoing surveillance and increased efforts to prevent nicotine ingestions among young children,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Madelyn Olivas, MHA, Center for Injury Research and Policy, The Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. It was published online in Pediatrics.

According to the authors, the NPDS is a passive surveillance system that underestimates the true number of nicotine ingestions among children younger than 6 years. The data were self-reported and cannot be completely verified by Poison Centers or America's Poison Centers. The increase in nicotine pouch ingestions may be partially attributable to the increased use of new NPDS product codes for these products.

Olivas reported receiving a student research scholarship from the Child Injury Prevention Alliance. The funding organization did not have any involvement in study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, manuscript writing, or publication decisions.

Let's be real. Medical school and residency are demanding jobs, and we are going to be working way more hours than some of our peers. It is super important to take care of not only our physical health, but also our mental health during this time.

Let's talk about signs of burnout and some signs that you might need to take a mental reset. 

Number one is chronic fatigue and poor sleep. If you're noticing that you're tossing and turning in your sleep or you are staying up with anxious thoughts and worries, this could be a sign that you are experiencing burnout.

Also, if you suddenly find yourself getting sick more often than usual, it could be your body's way of telling you that you are stressed, you are in a high cortisol state, and as a result, your immune system isn't able to fight off illness as best as it can. Then, of course, there are emotional signs, too, like feeling sad, lonely, and isolated.These can all be signs of early-onset depression. 

It is super important to recognize signs of burnout during residency and medical school because there is help if you need it.

Popular anti-obesity medications continue to be effective for weight loss even when availability and access is interrupted, according to a study being presented by a private weight-loss company Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

""Patients taking GLP-1 treatments like semaglutide and tirzepatide often face challenges consistently accessing their medications due to supply shortages or insurance coverage obstacles,"" said Kaelen L. Medeiros, M.S., director of data and research at privately held weight-loss company Calibrate in New York, N.Y.

While unpredictable GLP-1 medication access is frustrating, the good news is that our research shows effective weight loss can still be achieved if paired with appropriate lifestyle changes and coaching support.""

Kaelen L. Medeiros, Director, Data and Research, Calibrate

Researchers looked at how interruptions to GLP-1 medication access impacted weight-loss outcomes in real-world patients taking part in a commercial metabolic health program that also included intensive lifestyle intervention. Participants followed an intensive lifestyle change curriculum that emphasized the four pillars of metabolic health: food, exercise, sleep and emotional health, while receiving one-on-one health coaching.

The study reviewed records for 6,392 participants who had at least one month of GLP-1 access and completed at least one year in an obesity and overweight care program. Of these participants, 72.5% experienced at least one disruption in their GLP-1 treatment and 11.1% had multiple disruptions. Participants received an average of 8.13 GLP-1 fills during the first year of research and 15.25 fills during the second year.

After 12 months, participants who faced access issues achieved 13.7% weight loss in 12 months and 14.9% in 24 months. Those without treatment interruptions had 17% weight loss in 12 months and 20.1% in 24 months. Those who received only 1 to 4 treatments over 12 months also achieved clinically significant weight loss, with more than 10% change in body weight on average.

""Given the often-unpredictable availability and shifting insurance coverage associated with anti-obesity medications, it's important that patients understand the significant impact that lifestyle changes and coaching paired with treatment can have on their health outcomes,"" Medeiros said.

While findings indicate that significant weight loss is still possible for those with inconsistent access to GLP-1 medications, Medeiros said the results found that a consistent medication course combined with lifestyle changes and support remains the most effective weight-loss program option.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New autoimmune target identified in pediatric idiopathic nephrotic syndrome","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250714/New-autoimmune-target-identified-in-pediatric-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome.aspx","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 02:46:00 GMT","

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a serious kidney disease in children with no clear cause. In a recent study, researchers have identified a novel autoantibody targeting vinculin—a protein crucial for kidney cell structure—as a significant factor in INS. The study found that these autoantibodies are present during active diseases and decline when symptoms subside, suggesting potential for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Mouse models were further used to validate these findings.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), particularly prevalent in children, is a kidney disorder marked by severe protein loss in the urine and low blood protein (albumin) levels. Growing body of research has shown that autoantibodies, or antibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body's own cells and proteins against podocytes may play a role in INS, but the precise underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

Now, however, a study by researchers from Zhejiang University, China, sheds light on this mystery by identifying a previously unrecognized immune factor: autoantibodies targeting vinculin, a key structural protein present in kidney cells. Their findings were published online in Research on June 3, 2025. The research team was led by Dr. Hanyan Meng from the Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China, sought to investigate the pathogenic role and underlying mechanisms of anti-vinculin autoantibodies in INS.

What exactly is vinculin, and why does it matter in kidney health? Vinculin is a protein that plays an important role in cell adhesion and cell mobility. These proteins are particularly found in podocytes and critical for podocyte cytoskeletal integrity. Anti-vinculin autoantibodies—the body's own antibodies that attack vinculin—can cause damage to the kidney's filtering cells.

By analyzing serum samples from across 147 children with INS, the researchers discovered significantly elevated levels of anti-vinculin autoantibodies compared to healthy and disease control groups.

These antibodies were present in over half of the INS patients and closely correlated with the clinical markers of disease severity, including cholesterol levels and protein in urine.""

Dr. Hanyan Meng from the Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China

Notably, the antibody levels dropped as the children recovered, and over half of them no longer had these antibodies once their symptoms subsided. The team further conducted a series of experiments using mouse models to understand causality. When injected with anti-vinculin antibodies or when actively immunized with recombinant vinculin protein, the mice developed hallmark features of INS, including proteinuria (high levels of protein in urine) and cell injury, which were confirmed via immunofluorescence and electron microscopy.

Transcriptomic analysis of kidney tissue from these mice revealed an increased activation of genes associated with inflammation, B cell activation, and immune signaling, alongside downregulation of cytoskeletal genes. This suggests that anti-vinculin antibodies may not only damage podocytes directly but also activate a broader immune response that worsens the disease.

""These findings provide compelling evidence that anti-vinculin autoantibodies are not merely markers but active drivers of disease,"" highlights Dr. Meng. ""They could serve as dynamic biomarkers for early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and risk stratification in pediatric nephrotic syndrome.""

These findings add up to our understanding of INS and contribute to a growing body of work suggesting that various autoantibodies—against nephrin, Crb2, podocin, and other proteins found in the kidney's filtering units—may underlie different forms of kidney disease. Since vinculin is a critical structural protein in podocytes, its disruption by autoantibodies leads to loss of structural integrity and breakdown of the kidney's filtration barrier.

From a clinical perspective, the identification of anti-vinculin autoantibodies represents a significant step toward precision medicine for children with INS. While most pediatric patients respond well to steroids, a significant portion develops steroid resistance and doesn't respond well. The current study found that anti-vinculin antibodies were more prevalent in patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), suggesting their potential role in guiding treatment strategies.

""By adding antibody screening into routine clinical assessment, we may be able to reduce the need for invasive kidney biopsies and tailor better therapies to individual patients,"" adds Dr. Meng.

While the study holds significance, the authors acknowledge its limitations, calling for larger, multicenter studies to confirm the diagnostic value of anti-vinculin antibodies. In the future, their research will focus on how these autoantibodies are generated and how they access intracellular targets like vinculin, building on the understanding of INS and better strategies to overcome the disease.

A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event for patients that can cause short- and long-term mental health concerns as they shift to living within a new timeline driven by weeks or months between medical follow-up appointments. A new survey conducted on behalf of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC – James) highlights the widespread emotional impact of cancer, revealing what weighs heavy on the minds of adults when a loved one is diagnosed.

Kevin Johns, MD, director of the psychosocial oncology program at the OSUCCC – James said studies suggest that up to cancer patients are five times as likely to experience depression than the average population and an estimated 42% of breast cancer survivors experience anxiety.

Depression and anxiety can significantly impact a patient's ability to finish care and fully recover after treatment – all of which impacts long-term survival. It's not uncommon for patients to wait up to a year to see a psychiatrist, depending on where they live and what insurance they have. Patients going through cancer treatment simply can't wait that long – the need is acute but also chronic, so timely access is critical. We are working to fill those gaps in care to better support our patients and their caregivers.""

Kevin Johns, MD, director of the psychosocial oncology program, OSUCCC – James

A recent survey commissioned by the OSUCCC – James among U.S. adults age 18 or older focused on the top concerns when a loved one is diagnosed with cancer. The survey found that over three-quarters of adults surveyed list life expectancy (76%), course of treatment (69%) and pain (65%) as top concerns they have about loved ones diagnosed with cancer. The list of concerns was extensive, including: 

Side effects (55%) 

Family stress (54%)

Grief (49%)

Medication (42%)

Caregiver stress (34%)

Body image (11%)

None of the above (2%)

""The complex nature of caregivers' concerns is very representative of the unique challenges we face as a mental health community in supporting our patients through treatment and into their 'new normal' as a cancer survivor,"" Johns said. ""It is truly a life journey, and like any journey, it can have extreme ups and downs that must be navigated. Helping our patients thrive beyond the diagnosis through proper mental health care is paramount to achieving high quality of life."" 

Other notable points from the survey: 

Young Americans ages 18-29 are more likely than all other age groups to report grief (66%) as a top concern when a family member is diagnosed with cancer. 

Young adults are also more likely than older adults, age 65 and over, to say that body image (18%) is a top concern. 

Conversely, the oldest Americans are more likely than the youngest Americans to say that course of treatment (74%) and caregiver stress (37%) are top concerns for them when a loved one is diagnosed.

Johns noted that mental health is especially complicated in the cancer survivor population because challenges can manifest in different ways at different stages of the cancer journey through diagnosis, treatment and survivorship follow-up. He cited cognitive changes, severe fatigue, ""brain fog"" brought on by the effects of treatment, and even PTSD-like (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms or hallucinations and hospital delirium as side effects of cancer that are not often talked about but that can be very jarring for patients and caregivers alike.

""If patients or their caregivers are not warned beforehand that these symptoms can occur, it can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety and shame, so it is very important that we work with our patients and caregivers upfront to prepare them for what might happen,"" said Johns. 

Under Johns' leadership, the OSUCCC – James Psychosocial Oncology Program has greatly expanded its team of psychiatric providers, psychologists, social workers and other mental health professionals to support OSUCCC – James patients. 

In addition, Johns also helped the OSUCCC - James pilot an innovative oncology consulting service to help breast medical oncologists navigate medical management of anxiety and depression among their patients. The pilot initiative was received positively by patients and the medical oncologists and is now being expanded to serve patients with head and neck cancer.

""Patients going through cancer treatment already have so many appointments, and generally they develop a very close relationship with their medical oncologist, so this practitioner also becomes the default mental health provider if they do not have immediate access to a specialized health care provider,"" said Johns. ""This new model of support was designed to help extend existing mental health support services to as many patients as possible.""

This study was conducted by SSRS on its Opinion Panel Omnibus platform. The SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus is a national, twice-per-month, probability-based survey. Data collection was conducted from May 2 – May 5, 2025 among a sample of 1,008 respondents. The survey was conducted via web (n=978) and telephone (n=30) and administered in English. The margin of error for total respondents is +/-3.6 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population of U.S. adults ages 18 or older.

Anti-obesity medications can significantly raise testosterone levels and improve health outcomes for men with obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to a new study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

Testosterone not only plays a critical role in the body when it comes to male sexual functioning, but it can also have an impact on an individual's bone mass, fat distribution, muscle mass, strength and red blood cell production. Increases in body weight and prevalence of type 2 diabetes are often associated with lowered testosterone levels, resulting in fatigue, decreased libido and quality of life.

While it is well known that weight loss from lifestyle changes or bariatric surgery increases testosterone levels, the impact that anti-obesity medications may also have on these levels has not been widely studied. Our study is among the first to provide compelling evidence that low testosterone can be reversed with the use of commonly prescribed anti-obesity medications.""

Shellsea Portillo Canales, M.D., endocrinology fellow at SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital in St. Louis, Mo.

To test this hypothesis, researchers analyzed the electronic health records of 110 adult men with obesity or type 2 diabetes being treated with the weight-loss medications semaglutide, dulaglutide or tirzepatide and who were not on testosterone or hormonal therapy. Participants' total and free testosterone levels were measured before and during treatment over the course of 18 months.

Along with 10% weight loss, the proportion of men with normal levels of both total and free testosterone rose from 53% to 77%. These findings indicate that anti-obesity medications also can have a positive effect on the reproductive health of men with obesity or type 2 diabetes.

""Results from this study show that there is a direct correlation between the use of anti-obesity medications and testosterone levels,"" said Portillo Canales. ""Doctors and their patients can now consider this class of medications not only for the treatment of obesity and to control blood sugar, but also to benefit men's reproductive health.""

Obesity and type 2 diabetes in adolescence can interfere with bone development, potentially increasing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis later in life, according to a study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The teen years are the most critical for building lifelong bone strength, according to lead researcher Fida Bacha, M.D., of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. ""While adults with type 2 diabetes are known to have increased risk of fractures, this has not been investigated in youth with type 2 diabetes,"" Bacha said. ""We wanted to understand how childhood obesity and early type 2 diabetes affect bone health as children grow.""

The researchers followed 48 teenagers for a year, including 26 girls, with an average age of 15.5 years. Of these, 27% had normal weight, 31% were classified overweight with normal blood sugar, and 42% had overweight with impaired blood sugar control, including prediabetes (4 teens) or type 2 diabetes (16 teens).

The researchers measured the teens' body fat, fitness, blood sugar and insulin levels. Their bone structure and strength in the lower leg (tibia) and forearm (radius) was measured using high-resolution imaging.

The study found that teens with obesity, and especially those with type 2 diabetes, showed less improvement in bone strength and quality over time compared to their peers who were of normal weight. This was true for both the leg and arm bones. Higher insulin levels (a sign of insulin resistance) seemed to contribute to less increase in bone strength. Insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Obesity and early type 2 diabetes in adolescence don't just affect weight or blood sugar-they can quietly interfere with bone development during the most critical years for building lifelong bone strength. That means teens with these health issues may face a greater risk of fractures and osteoporosis as they get older.""

Rehab hospitals that help people recover from major surgeries and injuries have become a highly lucrative slice of the health care business. But federal data and inspection reports show that some run by the dominant company, Encompass Health Corp., and other for-profit corporations have had rare but serious incidents of patient harm and perform below average on two key safety measures tracked by Medicare.

Yet even when inspections reveal grave cases of injury, federal health officials do not inform consumers or impose fines the way they do for nursing homes. And Medicare doesn't provide easy-to-understand five-star ratings as it does for general hospitals.

In the most serious problems documented by regulators, rehab hospital errors involved patient deaths.

In Encompass Health's hospital in Huntington, West Virginia, Elizabeth VanBibber, 73, was fatally poisoned by a carbon monoxide leak during construction at the facility.

At its hospital in Jackson, Tennessee, a patient, 68, was found dead overnight, lying on the floor in a ""pool of blood"" after an alarm that was supposed to alert nurses that he had gotten out of bed had been turned off.

In its hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a nurse gave Frederick Roufs, 73, the wrong drug, one of 26 medication errors the hospital made over six months. He died two days later at another hospital.

""I can still see Fred laying in the bed as they shut each little machine off,"" said his widow, Susan Roufs. ""They clicked four of them, and then the love of my life was gone.""

Encompass, which owns 168 hospitals and admitted 248,000 patients last year, has led the transformation of this niche industry. In 2023, stand-alone for-profit medical rehabilitation hospitals overtook nonprofits as the places where the majority of annual patient admissions occur, a KFF Health News and New York Times analysis found. A third of all admissions were to Encompass hospitals. Such facilities are required to provide three hours of therapy a day, five days a week.

Across the nation, there are now nearly 400 stand-alone rehab hospitals, the bulk of which are for-profit. These hospitals collectively generate profits of 10%, more than general hospitals, which earn about 6%, and far more than skilled nursing homes, which make less than 0.5%, according to the most recent data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent congressional agency.

At the same time, the number of small, specialized units within acute care hospitals — where most rehab used to be provided — has dwindled. There are now around 800 of those, and most are nonprofits.

In its latest annual report, Encompass, which is publicly traded, reported an 11% net profit in 2024, earning $597 million last year on revenues of $5.4 billion.

Federal data on the performance of about 1,100 of the rehab facilities show Encompass tends to be better at helping most patients return home and remain there. In a two-year period ending in September 2023, Medicare rated 233 rehab facilities as performing better than the national rate for this major metric, called ""discharge to community."" Most rehabs with better community discharge rates are for-profit, and Encompass owns 79 of them.

But data from Medicare also reveals Encompass owns many of the rehabs with worse rates of potentially preventable, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Medicare evaluates how often patients are rehospitalized for conditions that might have been averted with proper care, including infections, bedsores, dehydration, and kidney failures.

Encompass accounts for about 1 in 7 rehab facilities nationally, but owned 34 of the 41 inpatient rehab facilities that Medicare rated as having statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions for discharged patients. (Overall, rates of readmission after discharge ranged from 7% to 12%, with a median of 9%.)

And it owned 28 of the 87 rehab facilities — 65 of which were for-profit — that had worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions to general hospitals during patient stays. (The median for these kinds of readmissions was 5%, and rates for individual rehabs ranged from 3% to 9%.)



Patrick Darby, the executive vice president and general counsel of Encompass, strongly defended the company's record in written responses to questions. He dismissed Medicare's readmissions ratings of ""better,"" ""worse,"" and ""no different than the national rate"" as ""a crude scoring measure"" and said ""performance is so similar across the board."" He called the violations found during health inspections ""rare occurrences"" that ""do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns.""

""The simplest and most accurate reason for EHC's success is that our hospitals provide superior care to patients,"" he said, referring to Encompass by its corporate initials.

Chih-Ying Li, an associate professor of occupational therapy at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston School of Health Professions, said in an interview that a research study she conducted found the profit status of a rehab facility was the only characteristic associated with higher unplanned readmissions.

""The finding is pretty robust,"" she said. ""It's not like huge, huge differences, but there are differences.""

VanBibber was admitted to Encompass' Huntington hospital in 2021 for therapy to strengthen her lungs. At the time, the hospital was undergoing a $3 million expansion, and state regulators had warned the company that areas of the hospital occupied by patients had to be isolated from the construction ""using airtight barriers,"" according to a health inspection report.

In her room, which was about 66 feet from the construction zone, she began having trouble breathing, the report said. When she told the staff, they ignored her and shut her door, according to a lawsuit brought by her estate. Staff members eventually noticed that she was ""lethargic and gasping for air,"" and called 911.

When the emergency medical squad arrived, the carbon monoxide detectors they wore sounded. By that time, VanBibber's blood oxygen levels were dangerously low, the inspection report said. She died three days later from respiratory failure and carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the inspection report and the lawsuit. A plumber had been using a gas-powered saw in the construction area, but there were no carbon monoxide detectors in the hallways, the report said.

In court papers, Encompass and its construction contractors denied negligence for VanBibber's death. The case is pending.

Inspectors determined Encompass failed to maintain a safe environment for all patients during construction and didn't properly evaluate other patients for signs of poisoning, the report said.

Since 2021, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees health inspections, has found that 10 Encompass hospitals, including the one that cared for VanBibber, had immediate jeopardy violations, federal records show. Such violations — like the ones that Medicare also found in connection with the deaths of Roufs and the patient who fell after leaving his bed — mean a hospital's failure to comply with federal rules has put patients at risk for serious injury, serious harm, serious impairment, or death.

Darby, the general counsel for Encompass, said the company regretted any clinical problems and had promptly addressed all such findings to the satisfaction of inspectors. He said Encompass that has an ""excellent compliance record,"" including superior results from its accreditation agency, and that its overall number of health citations was tiny given how many hospitals Encompass owns and how many patients it treats.

Six other corporate-operated for-profit hospitals were also cited, while none of the 31 stand-alone nonprofit rehab hospitals received such violations from 2021 to 2024. (Inspection reports for general hospitals do not systematically specify in which part of the building a violation occurred, so rehab unit violations cannot be identified.)

An alert called a bed alarm was at the root of immediate jeopardies at Encompass hospitals in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Jackson, Tennessee. The devices are pressure- and motion-sensitive and emit a sound and display a light to alert staff members that someone at a high risk of falls has left his or her bed.

In its Morgantown hospital, a nurse technician discovered a patient face down on the floor with a large gash on her head after a defective alarm did not go off, an inspection report said. After she died, the nurse told inspectors: ""We are having a lot of problems with the bed alarms.""

Medicare is not authorized by law to fine rehab hospitals for safety rule violations, even ones involving deaths uncovered during inspections, as it has done with nearly 8,000 nursing homes during the last three years, imposing average fines of about $28,000.

The only option is to entirely cut off a rehab hospital's reimbursement for all services by Medicare and Medicaid, which cover most patients. That step would most likely put it out of business and is almost never used because of its draconian consequences.

""Termination is typically a last resort after working with the provider to come back into compliance,"" Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson, said in an email.

As a result, because there's no graduated penalty, even the most serious — and rare — immediate jeopardy violations effectively carry no punishments so long as the hospital puts steps in place to avert future problems.

""Only having a nuclear weapon has really hurt patient safety,"" said Michael Millenson, a medical quality advocate.

One immediate jeopardy incident did result in a punishment, but only because the hospital was in California, which allows its health department to issue penalties. Encompass' Bakersfield hospital paid a $75,000 fine last year for failing to control the blood sugar of a patient who died after her heart stopped.

Encompass has accelerated its expansion in recent years and now operates in 38 states and Puerto Rico. It plans to open 17 more hospitals in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah by the end of 2027, according to its latest report.

It frequently moves into new markets by persuading local nonprofit hospitals to shutter their rehab units in exchange for an equity stake in a newly built Encompass hospital, company executives have told investors.

The president of Encompass, Mark Tarr, calls it a ""win-win proposition"": The local hospitals can use their emptied space for a more lucrative line of service and Encompass gets a ""jump start"" into a new market, with partner hospitals often referring patients.

Tarr, who was paid $9.3 million in compensation last year, told investors that Encompass requires that the existing hospitals sign a noncompete deal. Sixty-seven Encompass hospitals are joint ventures, mostly with nonprofit hospitals as investors, according to the company's June financial filing, the most recent available.

Darby said the company's profits allow it to build hospitals in areas that lack intensive inpatient rehabilitation and improve existing hospitals. ""High-quality patient care is not only consistent with shareholder return, but quality and shareholder return are in fact critical to one another,"" he said.

The success of Encompass is particularly notable given that it barely survived what experts said was one of the largest modern accounting scandals in 2003.

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that the company, then known as HealthSouth, overstated earnings by $2.7 billion to meet Wall Street analyst quarterly expectations, leading to the ouster of its founder and directors. In 2004, the company agreed to pay the government $325 million to settle Medicare fraud allegations without admitting wrongdoing. Darby credited the company's new leaders for obtaining a $2.9 billion judgment on behalf of shareholders against the company's founder.

The company changed its name to Encompass in 2018 after acquiring Encompass Home Health and Hospice. In 2019, the Justice Department announced the company had agreed to pay $48 million to settle whistleblower lawsuit claims that it misdiagnosed patients to get higher Medicare reimbursements, and admitted patients who were too sick to benefit from therapy. The company denied any wrongdoing, blaming independent physicians who worked at its hospitals. Darby said Encompass settled the case only to ""avoid more years of expense and disruption."" He said the Justice Department never filed a lawsuit despite years of investigation.

Rehab hospital inspection reports are not posted on Care Compare, Medicare's online search tool for consumers. KFF Health News had to sue CMS under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain all its inspection reports for rehab hospitals. In contrast, Care Compare publishes all nursing home inspection reports and assigns each facility a star rating for its adherence to health and safety rules.

So people now choosing a rehab hospital would not know that at the Encompass hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 2021, a nurse accidentally gave Roufs a blood pressure drug called hydralazine instead of hydroxyzine, his prescribed anti-anxiety medication, according to an inspection report. Roufs went into cardiac arrest. This type of error, called a ""look-alike/sound-alike,"" is one hospitals and staff members are supposed to be especially alert to.

Months before, an internal safety committee had identified a trend of medication errors, including when a nurse accidentally gave a patient 10 times the prescribed amount of insulin, sending him to the hospital, the inspection report said. The nurse had misread four units as 40. Since Roufs's death, inspectors have faulted the hospital six times for various lapses, most recently in April 2024 for improper wound care.

An Encompass hospital in Texarkana, Texas, misused antipsychotic medications to pacify patients, resulting in an immediate jeopardy finding from CMS, the report said. And the company's hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, was issued an immediate jeopardy violation for not keeping track of medication orders in 2023, when a patient had a cardiac arrest after not receiving all of his drugs, according to the inspection report.

The federal government's overall quality oversight efforts are limited. Medicare docks payment to rehab facilities for patients readmitted to a general hospital during shorter-than-average rehab stays, but unlike at general hospitals, there are no financial penalties when recently discharged rehab patients are hospitalized for critical health issues.

The Biden administration announced last year it intended to develop a rating scale of 1 to 5 stars for rehab facilities. The industry's trade association, the American Medical Rehabilitation Providers Association, requested a delay in the creation of star ratings until the current quality measures were refined. The Trump administration has not determined whether it will continue the effort to rate rehab facilities, according to a CMS spokesperson.

The family of Paul Webb Jr., 74, claimed in a lawsuit that the Encompass hospital in Erie left Webb unattended in a wheelchair for hours at a time, putting pressure on his tailbone, in 2021. His medical records, provided to reporters by the family, list a sitting tolerance of one hour.

Webb — who had been originally hospitalized after a brain bleed, a type of stroke — developed skin damage known as a pressure sore, or bedsore, on his bottom, the lawsuit said. The suit said the sore worsened after he was sent to a nursing home, which the family is also suing, then home, and he died later that year. In his final weeks, Webb was unable to stand, sit, or move much because of the injury, the lawsuit said.

In court papers, Encompass and the nursing home denied negligence, as Encompass has in some other pending and closed lawsuits that accused it of failing to prevent pressure sores because nurses and aides failed to regularly reposition patients, or notice and treat emerging sores. Darby said Webb's death occurred three months after his Encompass stay and was not related to his care at Encompass. He said no hospital with long-term patients could prevent every new or worsening pressure sore, but that Encompass' rates were similar to the 1% national average.

One of Webb's sons, Darel Webb, recalled a warning given to the family as they left an appointment their father had with wound specialists: A doctor brought up Christopher Reeve, the actor who played Superman in movies in the 1970s and 1980s.

""He goes, 'Remember, Superman was paralyzed from falling off the horse, but he died from a bedsore,'"" he said.

Jordan Rau has been writing about hospital safety since 2008. Irena Hwang is a New York Times data reporter who uses computational tools to uncover hidden stories and illuminate the news.

To examine the medical rehabilitation hospital industry, we obtained and analyzed a database of inspection reports of freestanding rehabilitation hospitals from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. We also obtained inspection reports from several states through public records requests.

We analyzed inpatient rehabilitation facility characteristics and patient volume data contained in hospital data files from the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization. This dataset compiles cost reports all hospitals submit each year to CMS. For each facility for the years 2012 to 2023, we categorized annual discharges by facility type (freestanding rehabilitation hospital or unit within an acute care hospital); facility ownership status (for-profit, nonprofit, or government); and which hospitals were owned by Encompass Health under its current or prior name, HealthSouth.

Financial information about Encompass Health was obtained from the company's Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure filings.

We examined the readmission rates for all inpatient rehabilitation facilities that CMS publishes in its quality data. CMS evaluates the frequency with which Medicare patients were readmitted for potentially preventable reasons to an acute care hospital during their rehab stay. Separately, CMS also evaluates the frequency of potentially preventable readmissions to an acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from rehab. We also examined the rate of successful return to home or community. Figures for all three metrics were available for about 1,100 of the roughly 1,200 rehab facilities in the CMS data. The most recent readmission data covered Medicare discharges from October 2021 through September 2023.

We examined nursing home penalties from the last three years from CMS' data on nursing homes.

New survey data from the Orlando Health Spine Center reveals a significant difference among Americans on how to manage neck and back pain. Respondents were split between relying on rest and reduced activity (44%), turning to over-the-counter pain relievers (42%), and hot/cold therapies (29%) - an uncertainty that may be discouraging some from seeking medical guidance.

We want patients living their best life. We want patients to be able to do the things they love with their family and friends. If they come to see us, we will be able to offer therapies or treatments to get them back to where they were much quicker.""

Brian Braithwaite, M.D., Interventional Spine & Pain Physician at the Orlando Health Spine Center

Dr. Braithwaite determines the best course of treatment for each patient at the Orlando Health Spine Center by starting with thorough examinations and images such as MRI or CT scans, ensuring a personalized approach to pain management. 

""Once we have a good idea of what's causing their pain, then it's easy to come up with the plan,"" said Dr. Braithwaite. ""It's very important that we're able to offer patients conservative alternatives because many times they don't need anything invasive to feel better.""

Reeta Brendamour, 66, experienced excruciating shoulder pain and arm numbness that kept her from enjoying her favorite activities and a once-active lifestyle. She initially tried home remedies and avoided seeing a doctor, concerned that surgery might be her only option. 

According to the survey, she's not alone, only 5% of Americans consider surgery their top option for relieving pain. ""I didn't want surgery. I didn't even want to go to the doctor to find out what was going on,"" Brendamour said. ""I just avoided it.""

When the pain became too much to bear, Reeta scheduled an appointment with Dr. Braithwaite, who diagnosed her with arthritis and degenerative disc disease. She learned the pain she was experiencing stemmed from her neck and he recommended steroid injections to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain. 

""Within two days, all my pain and all the numbness was gone,"" said Brendamour. ""It was a miracle. It truly was a miracle. I can now do things that I didn't think I was going to be able to do anymore.""

The treatment allowed her to return to activities she loves, including golfing, teaching yoga and traveling the world.

Dr. Braithwaite reminds patients that aging doesn't have to mean living in pain. ""Longevity and happiness aren't just about living pain-free - it's about maintaining function,"" he said. ""Your body doesn't heal like it used to, so it may require injection therapy or other treatments to accelerate the healing process and provide a full recovery.""

The Orlando Health Spine Center offers a comprehensive range of treatments for various conditions. 

""It's a one-stop shop - no matter what's going on with a patient's spine, neck or lower back, we can evaluate and help them feel better,"" said Dr. Braithwaite. ""Whether it's conservative treatment, physical therapy or imaging, everything can be done in-house to help patients find relief."" 

This survey was conducted online within the United States by Ipsos on the KnowledgePanel® from May 30 to June 1, 2025, and surveyed 1,024 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This poll is based on a nationally representative probability sample and has margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points at the 95%confidence level, for results based on the entire sample of adults.

New research uncovers just how much ultra-processed, high-energy food fills Australian supermarket shelves for children, raising alarms about kids' diets and calling for tougher food rules.

Study: Energy Density and Level of Processing of Packaged Food and Beverages Intended for Consumption by Australian Children. Image Credit: mamaza / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Nutrients, researchers analyzed the energy density (ED) and food processing levels in packaged food and drink items that were marketed towards young children and launched in Australia in recent years.

They found that 56% of the products they surveyed were high in ED (≥12.552 kJ/g or kJ/mL) while 81% were ultra-processed foods (UPFs; NOVA G4), highlighting the urgent need to introduce stricter regulations for food marketed to children.

Childhood obesity is a growing health issue in Australia, with one in four children (25.1%) affected (17% overweight and 8.1% obese). A poor diet, particularly high intake of ultra-processed and energy-dense foods, plays a significant role in this trend.

ED refers to the amount of energy (kilojoules) per gram or millilitre of food, and it is influenced mainly by fat (high ED) and water content (low ED). Foods with high ED are often less nutritious and linked to higher energy intake and weight gain.

UPFs, the most industrially processed category in the NOVA classification, often contain additives and modified ingredients to improve taste, appearance, and shelf life. These features can disrupt appetite regulation, leading to overeating and obesity in children. Despite this, children regularly consume large amounts of UPFs and high-ED foods.

Baby food dominated the under-5 market (95% of products), and over half of these items (57%) were ultra-processed, including growing-up milks marketed as supplements.

This study was the first in Australia to assess the packaged food environment for children using both ED and NOVA classifications over a 10-year period.

By examining food products launched since the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines, researchers aimed to understand how food processing and energy density have shaped children's food supply. The findings could support the development of stronger food marketing regulations for children and promote healthier food environments.

The research team used an observational and descriptive design to analyse packaged foods and drinks marketed to Australian children up to 12 years old between 2013 and 2023. They sourced food data from Mintel GNPD, a global dataset that tracks new products in major Australian supermarkets.

The products were classified into 'Food' and 'Drink' categories and subcategories, and only those with age-related marketing claims for the target age groups were included.

Data collected included product names, ingredients, nutritional information, and energy values. Energy density (ED) was calculated in kJ/g or kJ/mL and classified as low (≤4.184), medium (>4.184 to <12.552), or high (≥12.552).

The level of processing was determined using the NOVA classification system: unprocessed/minimally processed (G1), processed culinary ingredients (G2), processed (G3), and ultra-processed foods (G4). Products with vague ingredient lists were conservatively classified into lower NOVA groups.

Duplicate products and those with missing nutritional data were excluded. Researchers then used descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests to compare ED between UPFs and less-processed foods.

Even supposedly 'light' foods like fruit snacks and flavoured yoghurts often fell into the ultra-processed category, challenging the idea that low energy density always means healthy.

Between 2013 and 2023, 1,770 packaged food and drink products targeted at Australian children were released, with most (63%) aimed at children aged between 5 and 12 years old. Baby foods dominated the products for children under 5, while bakery, snacks, and confectionery items made up the bulk of products for older children.

Over half (56%) of all products were classified as high in ED, with the highest EDs observed in categories like snacks, confectionery, and chocolate. In contrast, baby food had the lowest median ED.

Regarding processing level, 81% of all products were classified as UPFs, including 93% of those for children between 5 and 12 years old, and 59% for those under 5 years old. Most high-ED products were also UPFs.

Significant differences between ED and NOVA categories were found only among foods for children under 5 years old (p<0.001), with high-ED products being more common in the UPF category for this group.

No significant differences were found for children between 5 and 12, as most products were UPFs regardless of ED. Low-ED UPFs, often perceived as healthy, such as fruit snacks, flavoured yoghurts, baby cereals, and growing-up milks, were also common, raising concerns about their potential impact on children's energy intake and appetite regulation.

The study flags a specific regulatory gap: growing-up milks (GUMs) – ultra-processed, high in free sugars, and not recommended by health authorities – faced no marketing restrictions despite their prevalence.

This study is the first in Australia to examine both energy density and food processing levels in products marketed to children. It found that most new packaged foods over the past decade were ultra-processed and energy-dense, particularly those for children between 5 and 12.

The findings raise concerns, especially for young children under 5, who are increasingly exposed to UPFs despite dietary guidelines promoting minimally processed foods during early development.

A key strength of the study is its use of a global database that captures recent trends in the marketplace. It also compared products across two age groups, offering valuable insights.

However, the database only includes newly launched items, potentially missing older products still on the market. The authors note that the Mintel GNPD likely represents a large proportion of the current Australian marketplace, but some products directed to children could have been missed. Additionally, the subjective nature of processing classification was addressed through a conservative approach: when ingredient lists were vague, products were classified into lower NOVA groups.

The study underscores the need for policy actions, such as stricter regulation of marketing and health claims, to reduce children's exposure to high-ED and UPF products and promote healthier food choices from an early age.

A novel AI-powered retina tracker can analyze retinal images with near-perfect accuracy in under one second, according to a study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. The researchers say the findings offer hope for sight-saving screenings for diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases that are fast, affordable, and accessible worldwide.

The application, an AI-based model integrated into Simple Mobile AI Retina Tracker (SMART), uses cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to analyze retinal fundus images quickly and accurately, on internet-powered devices including basic smartphones. The SMART AI application enables ophthalmologists to streamline patient screening, empowers primary care providers to incorporate eye exams into routine visits, and expands access to high-quality retinal assessments in regions lacking specialized ophthalmic care.""

Jansi Rani Sethuraj, B.S.N., R.N., C.C.R.N., presenting author of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, Texas

Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of preventable blindness, affects over 100 million people globally as the incidence and prevalence of diabetes continue to rise worldwide.

Two researchers, Ramya Elangovan and Kavin Elangovan of AIM Doctor in Houston, Texas, sourced several thousand anonymized retinal images from multiple datasets representing diverse populations spanning six continents. These images were used to train and validate deep learning models capable of detecting and staging diabetic retinopathy with over 99% accuracy in under one second. The tracker was also able to differentiate diabetic retinopathy from similar eye pathologies. Healthcare professionals from multiple international institutions independently validated the application's reliability and usability, underscoring its global applicability.

""By democratizing eye care through universally accessible mobile technology, this innovation has the potential to screen billions globally, reducing vision loss from diabetic retinopathy while transforming healthcare delivery systems,"" said the chief mentor of this project, Elangovan Krishnan, M.B., B.S., P.G.D.H.M., M.Tech., M.S., Ph.D., of AIM Doctor. ""This research proves that AI can be a force for good, bridging gaps in care and bringing hope to millions at risk of losing their sight.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New UAB-developed gene therapy for ALS receives orphan drug designation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250715/New-UAB-developed-gene-therapy-for-ALS-receives-orphan-drug-designation.aspx","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:04:00 GMT","

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to a new gene therapy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) developed at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and licensed to the U.S. company Klotho Neurosciences, Inc.

The drug uses a viral vector of the AAV (adeno-associated virus) type that expresses the secreted isoform of Klotho (s-KL) protein, with neuroregenerating, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In order to reach the neuromuscular junctions affected by the ALS disease, the vector acts under the control of a DNA sequence that regulates the expression of the protein specifically in the muscle (a muscle-specific promoter), so that therapeutic activity is directed towards the neuromuscular junctions. This innovative approach has shown very promising results in the most widely used mouse model for the preclinical study of ALS, delaying the onset of the disease, preserving neuromuscular function and extending survival.

The technological development was led by UAB researchers, with the involvement of the CIBER, ICREA and Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, co-owners of the intellectual property relating to the use of the Klotho protein and licensed to Klotho Neurosciences -a start-up company based on knowledge generated at UAB and listed on Nasdaq in 2023 (NASDAQ: KLTO)-. The technology was developed by the research groups of Assumpció Bosch and Miquel Chillón, both from the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the UAB Institut de Neurociències (INc-UAB). The research project also included the collaboration of the group led by Professor Xavier Navarro, researcher at the Institut de Neurociències and the UAB Department of Cellular Biology, Physiology and Immunology, and expert in neuroregeneration and motor neuron diseases.

The orphan drug designation for the therapy we have developed acknowledges the relevance of treatments targeting muscle and neuromuscular junction as a strategy for ALS.""

Assumpció Bosch, principal investigator of the study

""To date, we have been able to demonstrate efficacy in a leading animal model for this pathology. We are now testing it in other ALS models to confirm that this therapeutic solution can be applied to the widest possible number of patients"", adds Sergi Verdés, postdoctoral researcher on the research team.

Receiving the orphan drug designation by the FDA underscores the potential of the treatment for the rare and severely disabling disease ALS, which affects around 65,000 people in Europe and for which there is no effective treatment. This recognition offers advantages such as seven years of exclusivity for the drug in the U.S. market, fee waivers and tax incentives for clinical trials.

Klotho Neurosciences will now initiate the manufacturing of the vector, followed by meetings with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the near future with the aim of moving towards the first clinical trials in patients.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Research explores the link between lower micronutrient levels and chronic pain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250715/Research-explores-the-link-between-lower-micronutrient-levels-and-chronic-pain.aspx","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 05:14:00 GMT","

Lower levels of certain vitamins and minerals were found to be associated with chronic pain in a recently completed study led by researchers at the University of Arizona Health Sciences and published in Pain Practice. 

This is the first study to take a precision medicine approach to chronic pain on a large scale by broadly examining micronutrient levels of people with and without chronic pain and exploring the incidence of chronic pain in people with or without micronutrient deficiencies. The findings could inform personalized nutritional strategies to help manage chronic pain.

""I treat chronic pain patients, and oftentimes we don't come up with a diagnosis. But just because there isn't a surgery that will help you doesn't mean you're not in pain. It's just means that our understanding of pain is limited to date,"" said senior author Julie Pilitsis, MD, PhD, head of the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson Department of Neurosurgery and member of the Comprehensive Center for Pain & Addiction.

This study is a novel way to approach chronic pain treatment, where you are looking at the patient holistically to see what could be going on systemically that is easily modifiable – changes in diet as opposed to medications or other things.""

Julie Pilitsis, University of Arizona Health Sciences

The research team focused on five micronutrients commonly associated with chronic pain: vitamins D, B12, and C, folate and magnesium. They examined the micronutrient status of three groups: people without pain, people with mild-to-moderate chronic pain and people with severe chronic pain.

They found that for vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium, people with severe deficiencies were more likely to have severe chronic pain. Conversely, lower levels of vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium – and a greater incidence of those low levels – were seen in people with severe chronic pain.

""The finding that surprised us the most was that Asian females had higher vitamin B12 levels than expected,"" said co-author Deborah Morris, PhD, a research laboratory manager in the Department of Neurosurgery, explaining that B12 deficiencies were seen in other gender, race and ethnicity groups. ""Asian females with severe chronic pain had the highest vitamin B12 levels overall. We were expecting it to be lower.""

The results varied for vitamin C, where males with mild-to-moderate and severe chronic pain were more likely to have low and borderline low levels of vitamin C than males without chronic pain. Men with borderline and severe vitamin C deficiency were also more likely to have chronic pain.

Participant data came from the National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Database, where the largest enrollment has come from the University of Arizona-Banner Health program.

""The findings that are coming from complex demographic studies such as this one show that we can't just make assumptions for every patient that walks in the office,"" said Pilitsis, who is a member of the BIO5 Institute.

""Our study across various chronic pain conditions in a large, diverse population found that certain vitamins and mineral deficiencies are more frequent in people with chronic pain, and particularly in some in specific racial and ethnic groups,"" Morris added. ""Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people with chronic pain and reduce opioid usage, and these findings have the potential to do that as part of a holistic approach to pain management.""

A November 2024 data brief from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that nearly 25% of U.S. adults are living with chronic pain, which is associated with decreased quality of life, opioid misuse, increased anxiety and depression, and unmet mental health needs.

Morris and Pilitsis collaborated with researchers at Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Grigore T. Popa in Romania, and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium.

Adrenal hormone function was restored in animal studies, potentially paving the way for a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency in humans, according to research being presented by Aspect Biosystems on Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

Primary adrenal insufficiency, most commonly due to Addison's disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is a life-threatening condition that typically requires lifelong adrenal hormone replacement.

However, the current hormone replacement therapies have a significant treatment burden and fail to mimic the natural circadian rhythms of hormone secretion.

Our research shows that our adrenal Bioprinted Tissue Therapeutics (BTTs)-an 'off-the-shelf,' implantable cell therapy-can restore natural hormone function and perform long-term in animals, demonstrating its potential to offer a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency.""

Sam Wadsworth, Ph.D., CSO at Aspect Biosystems

The company's adrenal Bioprinted Tissue Therapeutics (BTTs) were studied in vitro to confirm their viability over time.

In the lab, the team at Aspect Biosystems stimulated the adrenal BTTs with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is typically released from the brain to stimulate cortisol release and observed a consistent cortisol release.

The BTTs were then implanted into mice that had undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands.

""Following implantation, mice that received adrenal BTTs showed a rapid and sustained increase in circulating cortisol, which is not endogenously produced in mice,"" Wadsworth said.

This confirmed that the adrenal BTTs were responsive.

""Notably, cortisol secretion followed the animals' circadian rhythm, replicating their natural daily hormone cycle,"" Wadsworth said. ""In contrast, mice implanted with cell-free implants showed no significant cortisol levels and did not respond to ACTH stimulation.""

The adrenal BTT-treated mice also showed improved survival, which continued throughout the study period of about six months.

""This novel approach has the potential to serve as a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency, transforming the lives of patients with this disease,"" Wadsworth said.

New study shows that autism is not one condition, but four, each driven by different genes and brain development patterns, helping to reshape diagnosis and care.

Study: Decomposition of phenotypic heterogeneity in autism reveals underlying genetic programs. Image credit: chrupka/Shutterstock.com

A paper published in Nature Genetics provides a new glimpse into the role of genetic variation in the range of clinical symptoms found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The team of researchers found that autism classes can be clinically distinguished. Each is associated with unique patterns of gene dysregulation, reflecting distinct molecular-level perturbations caused by class-specific sets of mutations.

ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties with social communication and interaction, often demonstrating restricted and repetitive behavior patterns, interests, or activities. With an increasing ASD burden each year, the phenotypic and genetic differences in the ASD pool are becoming more obvious.

A systematic evidence-based association study of genetic and phenotypic data has not matched the genetic and phenotypic complexity of ASD. The current study used a large sample of autism phenotypes to reveal phenotypic classes and the underlying genetic heterogeneity.

A person-centric method is essential in this analysis, rather than focusing on single traits, since each co-occurring trait inevitably affects the other. Only then can they be properly mapped to their genotypic origin. Such an approach provides a clearer picture of how these developmental disruptions interact and evolve, allowing for an informed prognosis.

This approach avoids the limitation of traditional trait-centric analyses and better captures the complex, interacting nature of ASD symptoms in real individuals.

The current study used genotypic and phenotypic data from the SPARK cohort of 5,392 people. They collected phenotypic data from standard diagnostic questionnaires (the Social Communication Questionnaire-Lifetime (SCQ), Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), and the Child Behavior Checklist 6–18 (CBCL), combined with the developmental milestone history.

Researchers applied a generative finite mixture modelling (GFMM) framework to analyze 239 features, allowing individuals to be grouped into clinically meaningful phenotypic classes based on their overall trait profiles.

The model distinguished autism classes using the seven core traits: limited social communication, restricted and/or repetitive behavior, attention deficit, disruptive behavior, anxiety and/or mood symptoms, developmental delay (DD), self-injury, and the severity of symptoms. They assigned each of 239 phenotype features associated or co-occurring with each trait.

Four ASD phenotypic classes emerged. One class (Social/behavioral) had both severe social communication deficits and restricted or repetitive behavior, compared to other ASD children. They also showed disruptive behavior and attention deficit, with anxiety, but normal developmental rates.

The Mixed ASD class distinctively shows developmental delay, despite some features of social communication deficits, restricted/repetitive behavior, and self-injury. The other two classes were Moderate challenges, with a lower ASD score for all seven core traits than other ASD children but above non-autistic siblings, and Broadly affected, with a higher score than other ASD children.

These classes were validated by their agreement with the reported co-occurring conditions, parental narratives, and medical history. For instance, the Broadly affected class was much more likely to have all co-occurring conditions: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), delayed language development, anxiety, and depression.

Conversely, the Mixed ASD class had the lowest odds of anxiety, depression, or ADHD. Yet they were at high risk for language and intellectual delay, and motor abnormalities, concordant with their delayed development and high occurrence of restricted/repetitive behavior. In contrast, the Social/behavioral class had a higher risk of ASD-associated ADHD, anxiety, and depression diagnoses.

Mixed ASD and Broadly affected classes were usually diagnosed the earliest. They were most likely to be receiving a variety of therapies, due to the highest cognitive impairment and poor language skills. The Broadly affected class also showed the most significant co-occurring conditions and the highest use of clinical interventions.

An independent cohort of autistic subjects also confirmed the validity of these classes. The model showed a high correlation in feature enrichment patterns across the SPARK and SSC cohorts, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.

The scientists then investigated genetic influences using polygenic scores (PGS) for autism and five well-accepted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for autism-related conditions or traits. They explored both inherited and newly arising genetic variations. The findings revealed genetic differences according to the four classes.

The Broadly affected and Social/behavioral classes had higher ADHD PGS signals than for other classes or non-autistic siblings. Depression-related PGS and diagnosis rate were both highest in the Social/behavioral class. This class also had the highest number of high-impact variants in neuronal genes, mainly expressed after birth. However, ASD PGS did not differ significantly between classes due to high within-group variance, highlighting the limited explanatory power of current common-variant-based ASD scores.

The Broadly affected class, which showed the highest rate of cognitive impairment, delayed development, and the lowest educational status, had the lowest IQ PGS. Thus, “co-occurring conditions were associated with common genetic variation that significantly differed among the four identified classes.”

All four classes had more mutations than non-autistic siblings, and mutations were unevenly distributed between the classes. The Broadly affected class had excessive loss-of-function (LoF) or missense mutations, and the social/behavioral class was the least enriched.

Whilst all four classes showed more mutations than non-ASD siblings, the Broadly affected class had the highest high-impact de novo mutations. In contrast, the Mixed ASD class showed increased rare inherited variation alongside de novo mutations, indicating a stronger inherited genetic component.

ASD-specific gene set analysis showed a higher burden of new LoF mutations associated with developmental delay. High-impact mutations in a relatively small group of genes contribute to cognitive impairment. The greater the development delay in the class, the higher the odds for new LoF mutations.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) target gene mutations were especially enriched in the Broadly affected class and the Mixed ASD class. FMRP in both Broadly affected and Mixed ASD classes was linked to developmental delay and cognitive deficit. The Broadly affected class showed additional enrichment for mood and behavioral traits such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and aggression.

Tracing the molecular pathways affected by these mutations showed that each class reflected specific pathway disruptions. For instance, disruption of microtubule activity, chromatin organization, and DNA repair was enriched in the Social/behavioral class, compared to neuronal action potential and membrane depolarization in Mixed ASD.

In the Mixed ASD class, LoF mutations affected prefrontal cortical neuronal genes expressed primarily during fetal and early newborn life. This class, therefore, had the most developmental delay and the earliest diagnosis, compared to the Social/behavioral class, where postnatal gene expression was disrupted.

The Broadly affected class showed gene dysregulation spanning all developmental stages and cell types, especially of FMRP target genes and highly constrained genes. In contrast, the Moderate challenges class had enrichment for variants in genes with lower evolutionary constraint, which may explain the milder developmental impact.

The study demonstrated the value of a person-centered rather than a trait-centric approach to ASD genotype-phenotype analysis. The four phenotype-based classes described here agreed with reported clinical features and can be applied to any clinical cohort. Importantly, it suggests that ASD phenotypes do not reflect a spectrum of intellectual disability.

The classes also had separate genetic signals and differed in the timing of gene dysregulation during the developmental trajectory. These differences correlate with the degree of delay in development and the outcome.

The study provides a framework to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying distinct ASD presentations, supported by genetic and molecular data across developmental stages.

These findings suggest new research directions to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying different ASD presentations, allowing for more precise diagnosis and management of these conditions.

The American Outlaws (AO), the largest supporters group for the U.S. men's and women's national teams, has announced a price cap of $45 (plus fees) for all U.S. Soccer-hosted matches through October 2026.

The changes will apply to the AO section at USMNT and USWNT matches hosted by the federation, which will consist of friendlies in the United States.

The move comes in the face of growing criticism over exorbitant ticket prices to see both national teams play on home soil. With the men's World Cup coming up next summer, AO co-founder Justin Brunken said that his group was partnering with the federation to increase accessibility.

“We've always believed soccer should be for everyone,” Brunken said in AO's announcement. “This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers — cost — and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing, and support together.”

At the recent Gold Cup, where ticket prices were set by Concacaf, several USMNT players and head coach Mauricio Pochettino lamented the lack of U.S. support from fans in the crowd.

At the semifinal against Guatemala in St. Louis, the AO section behind the goal was mostly filled with fans of Guatemala.

""From a comfort perspective, it's always nice to play in front of a pro-U.S. crowd. Whenever we play [in the U.S.], it doesn't happen often,"" midfielder Tyler Adams said after a loss to Mexico in the final — another match dominated by fans rooting against the USMNT.

Brunken said that he hoped the change would result in more pro-U.S. crowds, starting with the USMNT's upcoming friendlies in September and October.

""This isn't just about saving a few bucks. It's about keeping soccer grounded in community,” Brunken said. “AO was built to bring people together. This gets more people in the stands and more voices behind the team.”","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Gio Reyna's lack of playing time in Germany has reportedly led to one of MLS' top clubs targeting his services.

LAFC are leading the race to acquire Reyna this summer, German outlet Ruhr Nachrichten reported Tuesday. Reyna just recently concluded his summer involvement with Borussia Dortmund at the FIFA Club World Cup.

The U.S. men's national team midfielder scored two goals and registered one assist in 26 appearances for the Black and Yellow last season. Despite featuring in four different competitions, Reyna logged only 627 minutes of action. 

Reyna has been reduced to less than 1,000 minutes of playing time in each of his last two club seasons. The 22-year-old is heading into the final year of his contract. 

His decreasing club role has also led to limited USMNT opportunities for Reyna. Reyna has earned just one cap under Mauricio Pochettino since the Argentine's hiring as head coach last summer. 

LAFC sits sixth in the Western Conference and most recently lost a key attacking weapon in Olivier Giroud. Steve Cherundolo's squad were eliminated from the Club World Cup in the group stage, losing two of their three matches.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Diego Luna Draws interest from ¨La Liga Española¨.","https://mlsmultiplex.com/if-usmnt-diego-luna-move-celta-de-vigo-01k076dwqffj","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:20:52 GMT","

Recent performances with Real Salt Lake and the U.S. men's national team make it clear that Diego Luna has the skills required to succeed in Europe and follow the path of American attackers like Christian Pulisic, Malik Tillman and Clint Dempsey.

And last week, GiveMeSport's Tom Bogert revealed that La Liga outfit Celta de Vigo had expressed genuine interest in the 21-year-old, who scored three times for the USMNT at the Concacaf Gold Cup.

A move to La Liga would mark a major step forward in Luna's young career, placing him in one of the world's top leagues alongside stars like Kylian Mbappé and Lamine Yamal. It's a transition that many believe Luna is ready for, not just because of his technical ability, but because of his character, tactical awareness, and growing maturity on the field.

When asked about the rumors linking him to Celta, Luna told AS USA Latino:  “There are many conversations about many things. I also have dreams and aspirations of going to Europe, but I will analyze whether that or staying in the United States is the best thing for me at this time.”

The question is whether a move to Spain's Northwest would represent those best interests.

Celta de Vigo is currently managed by Claudio Giráldez, a young coach praised for his dynamic 3-4-3 formation and development-focused approach. Promoted from within the club after a successful stint with Celta's B team, Giráldez emphasizes an aggressive, high-paced style of play, blending youthful energy with veteran experience — a system that could suit Luna well.

Luna is reportedly viewed as a replacement for Hugo González, who recently transferred to Sevilla. If signed, Luna's role will be linking the midfield with the forward line, where Spanish international Borja Iglesias plays. It could be a good fit tactically for Luna, who spent a portion of his youth career at the  Barcelona Residency Academy in Arizona.

Celta finished seventh in La Liga last season and will compete in the UEFA Conference League this year. The Galician club has a history of nurturing young talent and recently parted ways with U.S. international Luca de la Torre, who played alongside Luna at the Gold Cup before moving to San Diego FC.

Off the field, Celta might feel more like Salt Lake City than you might expect. While La Liga is an enormous league, Vigo is one of its smaller markets, with a population of roughly 300,000 that puts it outside of Spain's 10 largest cities. 

And the club plays its home matches at the Balaídos Stadium, with a capacity of 23,000, which is similar in size to RSL's America First Field. But also like the Claret-and-Cobalt. Celta have punched above their small market weight at times, and the club has given rise to stars like Iago Aspas and Gabri Veiga

At this moment, Celta's interest in Luna has not materialized into a formal offer. Real Salt Lake is unlikely to let the midfielder leave cheaply, with his market value currently estimated by Transfermarkt at $9.3 million, a figure that could rise following his national team exploits. Luna, who is of Mexican descent, has also expressed a desire to play for Club América in Mexico someday, further fueling speculation about his next move.

Regardless of where he lands next, one thing is certain: Luna is among the brightest young prospects in US soccer. Whether he continues his development in MLS, heads to La Liga, or explores other international opportunities, his trajectory is firmly pointing upward.

...

Aware of its global impact and the success of the first Club World Cup, Real Madrid made a bold suggestion to FIFA: that the tournament be held every two years.

The information is from The Guardian.

Initially, the competition will be held every four seasons.

The next one is scheduled for 2029, but still without a defined venue - Brazil has already positioned itself as a possibility.

FIFA, in turn, would only consider increasing the number of participating clubs: from 32 to 48.

Real's suggestion was reportedly made during the edition held in the United States.

The team of Xabi Alonso fell in the semifinals by taking a resounding 4 x 0 from the future runner-up PSG.

The performance of the biggest Champions champion in the US was not ideal. But there was plenty of success off the field.

Real alone was responsible for the sale of 25% of the tickets for the World Cup.

One of the focuses of President Florentino Pérez is to secure more revenue for a club that took out a loan of 1.2 billion euros for the renovation of Santiago Bernabéu.

Real wants a World Cup every two years even if it is not guaranteed in the next one.

🤔 Which teams are certain for 2029?

Despite having won the first edition of the Club World Cup, Chelsea does not yet have a guaranteed spot in the next one.

The only European club already certain is PSG, the current Champions League champion.

The four qualifiers are:

Al-Ahli (KSA) - Champion of the Asian Champions League 2024/25

Cruz Azul (MEX) - Champion of the Concacaf Champions Cup 2025

PSG - Champion of the Uefa Champions League 2024/25

Pyramids FC (EGY) - Champion of the CAF Champions League 2024/25

Who can host the World Cup in 2029❓ 

Still according to The Guardian, FIFA is considering more than one venue for the next edition.

The fact that the 2030 World Cup has Spain, Portugal, and Morocco as hosts is an indication that the club tournament may have games in the same countries.

But Portugal has not shown interest.

Qatar, the host of the national teams' World Cup in 2022, has already positioned itself as a possibility.

The same goes for Brazil, the stage in 2014.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","How Donald Trump Stopped Chelsea Getting the Real Club World Cup Trophy","https://www.si.com/soccer/how-donald-trump-stopped-chelsea-real-club-world-cup-trophy","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

Not for the first time in his life, U.S. President Donald Trump ensured that he was the center of attention.

Much to the bemusement of Chelsea's celebratory players, Trump planted himself in the heart of the blue scrum as Reece James eventually hoisted the Club World Cup trophy aloft. However, according to Trump himself, James and his teammates were celebrating with a replica, rather than the real thing.

The trophy, which shifts from a flat plate to a golden spiral with the twist of a special key, is the pride and joy of FIFA President Gianni Infantino, whose name happens to be carved into the piece of silverware (twice).

During his shameless promotion tour of the newly expanded competition's inaugural outing, Infantino spent plenty of time buttering up the host nation's president. The trophy's first outing was in the White House's Oval Office back in March, an occasion which saw Trump hail Infantino as “the king of soccer, I guess, in a certain way”.

Infantino may be the king, but Trump always reserves top billing for himself. The real Club World Cup trophy made by Tiffany & Co. has remained at the White House since that event in March.

“I said, When are you going to pick up the trophy? [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one,'” Trump told DAZN during the Club World Cup final. “And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”

Footage from the post-match ceremony also appeared to show Trump pocketing one of the winners' medals.

This summer's Club World Cup acted as a forerunner to next summer's international men's World Cup which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. “It's about unity,” Trump said about the upcoming competition. “It's about everybody getting together and a lot of love between countries. I guess this is probably the most international sport, so it can really bring the world together.”

It was “the best v the best”, it was “the worst idea ever implemented in football”. It delivered showstopping games and some rank attendances. It endured extreme heatwaves and storm delays. Its riches were fought for fiercely by clubs, who also fear “disaster” seasons ahead. And it ended with U.S. President Donald Trump sharing the podium with eventual champions Chelsea.

Yes, it's fair to say the newly-expanded 2025 Club World Cup was a football tournament unlike any other.

Here a selection of The Athletic's writers on the ground in U.S. reflect on the best and worst of the event, what impact it may have on the season ahead, what it suggests the 2026 World Cup will be like and what should change before it is staged again.

James Horncastle: I enjoyed seeing a relaxed Pep Guardiola playing on the beach with his Manchester City players. It needed to be cut like a Top Gun montage with some Kenny Loggins music. The fact Loggins, a master of the 80s movie soundtrack, was overlooked as one of the musical ambassadors for this tournament feels like a missed opportunity.

Oliver Kay: I can't claim to have witnessed it myself, but I walked through Times Square so many times over the past week that I would like to think it happened under my nose and I didn't see it. It was that video of Cole Palmer wobbling awkwardly on a scooter, through the crowds, pretty much unnoticed, in one of the world's biggest tourist spots, where there's a giant billboard with his image on it. I love his ability on the pitch, as showcased in the final, and I love his authenticity off it.

Jordan Campbell: Thiago Silva channeling his inner Al Pacino. The Fluminense captain delivered a stirring speech to his team-mates about not leaving things for later as tomorrow is not promised. It inspired the Brazilian side to a shock 2-0 win over Inter Milan and they then went on to beat City's conquerors Al Hilal to make the semi-finals. It was a moment that emphasised how big a role leadership still plays in the sport and captured the significance of this competition to the South Americans.

Mario Cortegana: From a purely footballing point of view, Al Hilal's victory against Manchester City. It was a very beautiful game, with a lot of drama, and left us with surely the biggest surprise of the tournament. It was also a warning of what Saudi football can or intends to do ahead of the World Cup they will host in 2034.

I also really enjoyed being able to watch live and from so close (in Valdebebas they put us far away!) the first training sessions of Xabi Alonso and his staff at the helm of Real Madrid. It is very different from what we were used to with Carlo Ancelotti since 2021.

Felipe Cardenas: When Boca Juniors fans took over Miami and then turned Hard Rock Stadium into a modern version of La Bombonera. With Bayern Munich as the opponent, it was Boca's moment to shine under the global spotlight. The stadium shook, the chanting never stopped. Miguel Merentiel's equaliser amounted to absolute bedlam. Boca fans sang the entire game and cried tears of joy even after the loss.

Jeff Rueter: For all of the atmosphere created by their fans, Boca Juniors left much to be desired with their onfield performance. That shouldn't tarnish the achievement of Auckland City, taking a point off of Boca to close the group stage. For the only amateur team in the field to get a result against any team, much less one of the world's most ubiquitous legacy clubs, is the sort of game that only an event like this can create.

Mark Carey: Leaning into the Americanisms of this tournament, I found it funny that legendary boxing announcer Michael Buffer screamed: “Let's get ready to rumble!” ahead of both semi-finals and the final. Having each player enter the pitch individually in their own respective “ring walk” is one thing, but come on — that is too much. I found it entertaining, but not necessarily for the right reasons.

Liam Twomey: This tournament will not go down as a high point in the history of the football fan experience, but the South American supporters had the best time. One memory that will always stick with me was seeing — and smelling — the Brazilian barbecue tailgate parties that Flamengo fans had in the car parks outside Lincoln Financial Field before and after their win over Chelsea. FIFA will want to see more of that fusion of local and American culture at the World Cup next year.

Asli Pelit: I loved watching a handful of beloved South American teams bring that unmistakable garra Sudamericana back to a sport increasingly warped by sovereign funds, private equity, and billionaire ownership. A handful of players from these clubs also reminded me that no matter how old a player is (nor how many times he's bounced between Europe's elite clubs) when they come back home to retire swiftly, there's still joy in the fight. Shout out to Thiago Silva for proving it's never just a farewell tour.

And the fans. Not the casuals who swap jerseys like yesterday's gym shirts, but the die-hards, the ones who live for their club, who travel across continents, and who chant through the scorching sun until their legs give out. They made me remember why I do this. Why I still love this game, even when so much of it feels lost.

James Horncastle: When the Oval Office became a mixed zone and Donald Trump spoke about the Middle East and then turned and asked a bemused set of Juventus players: “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” A club nicknamed the Old Lady has rarely looked so uncomfortable amid stately locker-room talk.

Jordan Campbell: The tears of Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves, Diogo Jota's best friend, as a minute's silence was held for the Liverpool forward. As the game started, both of them were visibly still trying to trick their brains into game mode, but how could they? It was heartbreaking to watch. In that moment, it showed that the melodrama that tends to come with football is exactly that.

Mark Carey: The pain of seeing current, and former, team-mates do their best to hold their emotions together during a moment's reflection for Diogo Jota is a memory that will not go away in a hurry. How they found the strength to think about kicking a football after recent events is beyond comprehension.

Oliver Kay: I agree with Mark. Not directly Club World Cup-related, but it was waking up in Atlanta to the tragic news about Diogo Jota and Andre Silva and then seeing and feeling what a profound effect that had on the whole tournament and the whole sport. It still doesn't seem real.

Jeff Rueter: Gianni Infantino and Juventus' appearance at the White House was particularly catastrophic coming a day before the U.S.'s air strikes in Iran, with reporters posing questions about Trump's plans while Infantino watched on. Mind you, Iran qualified for the 2026 World Cup in March. For an organization that went to great lengths to keep politics away from the last instalment in Qatar, it was a flagrant instance of hypocrisy.

Mario Cortegana: Real Madrid's painful semi-final defeat against PSG, in which the best thing for Los Blancos was the result (4-0). This thrashing has restored some worries inside and outside the team when it seemed that the arrival of Alonso had changed that.

Liam Twomey: Sadly I fear this is doomed to become the defining image of Infantino's inaugural expanded FIFA Club World Cup: a beaming President Trump keeping himself front and centre of Chelsea's trophy lift at MetLife Stadium, generating the most emphatic visual riposte possible to the notion that sport can ever be kept separate from politics.

Felipe Cardenas: Hard to argue against the politicization of the Club World Cup. It was blatant and completely unnecessary. I will say that seeing Jamal Musiala's leg break in person (even from a distance in the press tribune) was heartbreaking. In Qatar three years ago, Musiala was a 19-year-old phenom and arguably one of the tournament's best players. Now his injury has put his participation at the next World Cup at risk.

Asli Pelit: There is a creeping Americanization of football, no one asked for and no one needs, least of all at something like the Club World Cup which is supposedly happening to make casual fans love and understand the sport. We don't need player-by-player intros and we definitely don't need “Let's get ready to Rumble” echoing across a football pitch. The beauty of this sport is in its existing rituals, its global soul, not in theatrics borrowed from sports that stop every 10 seconds for commercials. Keep the gimmicks out. Let football be football.

James Horncastle: Angel Di Maria. I still don't think enough is made of how important this guy is to Argentine football. He got the gold medal goal in the 2008 Olympic final, the only goal in the 2021 Copa America final and scored in the 2022 World Cup final. It was a privilege to watch him play his last games for a European team before heading home to Rosario Central.

Jordan Campbell: Since Fluminense winger Jhon Arias has gone from hipster to mainstream (and maybe Wolves) I shall avoid naming the Colombian. Ruben Neves' pinpoint passing and set-piece delivery was a joy to witness for Al Hilal, while Palmer is just so imaginative that he excites every time he gets on the ball. But, even after all these years, it was still Lionel Messi. The narrative that he is no longer an elite player is lazy. Of course he has faded but there were very few players who proved they are clearly above him in his ability to dominate a game. Playing alongside players way below his level, he carried Inter Miami and even against PSG he had a dozen moments where he showed why his brain works differently to everyone else.

Oliver Kay: I share Jordan's enduring love of watching Messi, as well as Palmer. But unlike Jordan, I'm not too cool to have been anything other than spellbound by Fluminense's Arias. What a player: so skilful, so creative, so clever but also so direct in what he does. I would love to see how he fares in Premier League if he does join Wolves, but I kind of love the fact that he's 27, at the peak of his powers, and still playing in South America.

Mark Carey: I enjoyed Arda Guler dropping into a deeper role and dictating Real Madrid's build-up from deep. Guler has struggled for regular minutes since moving to Spain, but was billed as an heir to Luka Modric by Ancelotti before he left the club. It looks like next season will be the biggest of the 20-year-old's career under Alonso.

Mario Cortegana: Gonzalo Garcia. Even for those of us who follow the Real Madrid academy, his emergence has been impressive. It's not normal for a kid from Castilla (Madrid's reserve team) who had only played 61 minutes this season under Ancelotti to have taken advantage of injuries to Kylian Mbappe and Endrick in this way, with four goals and an assist in six games. And his impact has gone beyond this very good data: we must highlight his defensive work, his reading of the game, the feeling he puts into each play…. The best summary of his tournament is that Alonso compared him to club legend Raul.

Jeff Rueter: Nottingham Forest fans should feel bullish about Igor Jesus's chances of acclimating to the Premier League. With Botafogo, the 24-year-old showed clever movement to pair with his immense physicality to win headers and create separation in the box. Having earned four caps for Brazil since debuting in October, he'll be determined to make the World Cup roster.

Felipe Cardenas: I thought that none of us were going to pick Arias. Well done, Oli. No one, and I mean no one, was able to take the ball off of the Colombian. His low center of gravity and apparent casual way of transporting the ball around the pitch is so impressive. However, I covered PSG multiple times during the tournament and came away as a fan of both Desire Doue and Bradley Barcola. Both players are street-ball type dribblers that any football fan would enjoy watching.

Liam Twomey: No player made a bigger impact on the business end of this Club World Cup than Joao Pedro. The Brazilian was on holiday when Chelsea signed him from Brighton & Hove Albion during the mid-tournament player registration window, but his holidays are clearly nowhere near as indulgent as mine. He arrived in prime shape and immediately transformed Chelsea's attack, providing a clinical edge to Enzo Maresca's possession play with two brilliant goals in the semi-final win over Fluminense and one more in the final against PSG. Given the riches on offer at this tournament, he has already repaid his transfer fee.

Asli Pelit: Ousmane Dembele. His football IQ and spatial understanding were remarkable. I don't know what happened to him at the final but until then, he was brilliant and a joy to watch.

James Horncastle: I'd expect everyone to say Boca, and with good reason. Bayern's captured some of the sentiment with their banner at the Auckland City game. “Ten years Baur au Lac. World football is more poorly governed than before. Smash FIFA!” I'm going to go with the fans who actually turned up for the Mamelodi Sundowns-Ulsan game in Orlando. To be one of the 3,000 that felt like 300, now that's hardcore.

Jordan Campbell: Flamengo. It is difficult to decide between them, Palmeiras and Botafogo but, from what I witnessed, Flamengo showed why they have the biggest fan base in Brazil. They turned out in swathes and organised themselves at games so that it felt like a domestic setting with blocks of red generating the best buzz of the live games I witnessed. An honourable mention must go to the estimated 15,000 Saudis who were in Orlando to see Al Hilal beat Manchester City as they were seriously boisterous.

Oliver Kay: Urawa Red Diamonds' fans were amazing. I loved the constant singing, the bouncing up and down, and the overall commitment to supporting their team and enjoying the experience, thousands of miles from home, when they were losing every game. They even did that wonderfully Japanese thing of cleaning up the terraces after themselves. I had a nice chat with a couple of their fans in Charlotte. They'd bought tickets for a knockout game there in anticipation of winning the group. They agreed that was hilarious.

Mark Carey: The Brazilian fans have had such rave reviews, and I agree. I watched Palmeiras twice in the flesh, and their fans did not stop bouncing the whole game from behind the goal. When Paulinho scored an extra-time winner against Botafogo? Bedlam. Unlike anything I have seen in England.

Felipe Cardenas: Supporters for every Brazilian club really showed out during the tournament. I'll add River Plate's fans as well. Perhaps they weren't given the credit they feel they deserve. River played all three group matches on the West Coast of the U.S., which for River fans and some pundits in Argentina, was a slap in the face. ‘How dare they put Boca in Miami and River in Seattle?', they argued. But still, Los Millonarios didn't make headlines with their traveling band of loyalists, but they were well supported in a part of the country that wasn't as accessible for their fans.

Mario Cortegana: From what I have been able to experience live, those of Real Madrid. Several players actually expressed that it was almost like playing at home. From what I have seen and heard on television, I would highlight the Argentines, above all, and the Brazilians.

Jeff Rueter: It's one thing to travel around the world to follow a tournament favourite. For fans who made the trip to catch the field's lesser-followed clubs, like the Mamelodi Sundowns-Ulsan match as well as those of Auckland City, it seemed like an unforgettable chance to see their teams play on a global stage.

Liam Twomey: Flamengo's supporters were the best I saw in person, both in terms of numbers and volume, and I was fortunate enough to see them twice. A word of acknowledgement for the fans of Esperance de Tunis, however, who brought their songs and their drums to Philadelphia and never allowed their spirit to be dampened even as Chelsea ruthlessly dispatched their team.

Asli Pelit: I spent most of the tournament with Fluminense and Palmeiras fans: pure passion, non-stop music, the kind of energy that makes you feel alive. But when it comes to sheer fandom, Boca fans in Miami and Los Millonarios out on the West Coast put everyone else to shame. You could feel it through the screen, even with DAZN's spotty coverage trying its best to ruin the vibe.

James Horncastle: I enjoyed a lot of the football at this tournament. It wasn't played at a pre-season pace. If it looked like it did at times that was a consequence of the heat. Manchester City-Al Hilal stands out. Mamelodi-Borussia Dortmund was great fun and there were some good 0-0s, notably Sergio Ramos' Monterrey against River Plate, which was studs up and guards down; a Street Fighter arcade.

Jordan Campbell: Manchester City 3-4 Al Hilal. It had everything. The Saudi side refusing to kick off until the Venezuelan referee (called Valenzuela) checked the VAR monitor (he didn't), a goalkeeping clinic from Yassine Bounou, Malcom becoming the world-class player many believed he would for half an hour and, after a late extra-time winner, a major upset. Don't forget the geopolitics, either. It was one of those rare games that once it burst into life, literally anything could have happened and it would not have been a surprise. Utter chaos.

Oliver Kay: The most enthralling game was Al Hilal's 4-3 victory over Manchester City, as others have said, but I also really enjoyed PSG's 2-0 win over Bayern in Atlanta. It was outstanding, lots of drama and high-quality performances on both sides. It wouldn't have looked out of place in the Champions League knock-out round — which, although Infantino won't like this, remains the gold standard for club football.

Mark Carey: Not just because I was lucky to see the game live, but PSG's dismantling of Real Madrid was nothing short of the perfect performance. Luis Enrique's side made Madrid look like a European minnow, bagging three goals before we had reached half an hour. A 4-0 victory was actually a mercy, as PSG took their foot off the gas in the second half in the scorching New Jersey heat.

Mario Cortegana: Although it could also be the PSG-Real Madrid, I'll take the Manchester City 3-4 Al Hilal. The result was a surprise, the game was a rollercoaster, there were so many goals and it went all the way to extra time. The reactions and the faces of Guardiola and his players also showed how much they cared.

Jeff Rueter: Botafogo's 1-0 upset of PSG and Flamengo's ensuing 3-1 win over Chelsea provided this tournament with its proof of concept that teams from beyond Europe could spring surprises. Botafogo's win saw Renato Paiva concoct a bold scheme, defending with an aggressively advancing defensive line to limit PSG's space. And, in true “big club” fashion, Botafogo fired Paiva after a round of 16 exit. So it goes.

Felipe Cardenas: Aside from Musiala's horror injury, the PSG-Bayern clash was, as they say, a proper football match. Both sides were absolutely going for it, with the French champions admitting the day prior that revenge was on their minds. PSG had not forgotten a loss they suffered at the Allianz Arena in November of 2024 during the Champions League. Before over 65,000 people in Atlanta, this European battle was tactical, attacking and full of dramatic moments. PSG eliminated Bayern 2-0 with nine men. It was an incredible theatre.

Liam Twomey: At the risk of being skewed by the matches I attended, I'll go for Bayern's 4-2 win over Flamengo in Miami. Filipe Luis' side played the best football of any non-European team at this tournament and after a horrendous opening 10 minutes they really turned the screws on Bayern, who were rescued ultimately by the clinical finishing of Harry Kane.

Asli Pelit: Echoing Jeff, I loved how Flamengo and Botafogo beat Chelsea and PSG unexpectedly in the group stages. I love a good underdog story in football. Monterrey vs Inter Milan was also a good one.

James Horncastle: Better. Of course, it'll be better than this tournament. But it will also be disrupted, it'll be hot, expensive, knackering and the U.S. and its cities are so sprawling I think there will still be times when you ask yourself: is a major tournament going on here? I left the Club World Cup seeing cracks in the facade of America as the greatest place on earth to experience live events.

Mark Carey: Hot. You can improve things elsewhere — you can even have a bigger PR push to get more fans in the stadium — but you cannot change the weather conditions. In club football, established patterns of play means that players can adapt tactically to the conditions a little more, but internationally you are not afforded that same time to work on those ideas. Therefore, next summer could be quite an attritional tournament.

Jordan Campbell: Peripheral. I say that because while I think the football at the Club World Cup itself was a success, it just never seemed to be the centre of attention in any city. It didn't help that it was competing for attention with the Gold Cup, NFL, NBA and MLB but I'm not sure you can truly have a captive audience spread across three different countries. Major tournaments are supposed to feel like the centre of the universe for a few weeks . The World Cup is the biggest prize in the sports world but there were regular challenges in trying to find bars who knew the tournament was happening, or who were prepared to show it on one of their million screens. It could make the whole thing seem a little numbing next summer.

Oliver Kay: Big … and hot … and possibly chaotic. The past four weeks have barely scratched the surface of next summer's potential, but the World Cup will be a different matter. It will be spread out across three countries, but I think it will really resonate in the host cities, with so many more fans arriving from overseas. There'll be more pressure on airlines and public transport, that is for sure.

Mario Cortegana: There is plenty of room for improvement, though I have my doubts over how much will change. It is clear that the weather has been a very negative factor, as well as the quality of the grass (although I expected more serious injuries and thankfully there were few). Ticket sales, prices and the press facilities also left much to be desired.

Jeff Rueter: More “business as usual” than spectacular. Don't get me wrong: a World Cup will always break away from the churn of the sport's routine, and there's no like-for-like comparison to be found against the Club World Cup. Still, there's a bit of big event fatigue settling in for ticket-buying fans, players, coaches and stadium staff. From the 2024 Copa América to this Club World Cup — plus the looming 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles — the world's biggest tournament just feels like the latest in a litany of biggest tournaments.

Felipe Cardenas: Overwhelming. The cross-country travel, 48 teams and their supporters, an aviation industry that's understaffed and under fire will all become significant factors. I agree with James that this Club World Cup, while described as a 2026 dress rehearsal, cemented the fact that the U.S. still has work to do as the host of a major football tournament. The Copa America last summer broke open the cracks in the infrastructure that Americans so often boast about.

Liam Twomey: Slower to gain momentum. Even in a Club World Cup group stage that sagged at times, the performances of the South American teams created some fun early intrigue. A 32-team tournament maintained some semblance of urgency; now imagine a format which requires an entire group stage to go from 48 to 32 teams. There will be more interest in next summer's World Cup, but more boredom early on too.

Asli Pelit: Here's my wish list for next year: More cooling stations around stadiums. If noon kickoffs are non-negotiable, then keeping fans hydrated and safe in 110-degree heat isn't optional. People need shade structures and water fountains. And while we're at it: simplify public transportation to the stadiums. No one should need a GPS, a prayer, and three train transfers just to get to a game.

James Horncastle: The participants will be late back, less rested and more injury-prone. People still haven't realised AFCON is in January and it clashes with the expanded Champions League. PSG aside, I wonder how many of the teams involved will win their domestic league.

Jordan Campbell: From speaking to performance and fitness coaches in the Premier League a few months back, those not working at a club competing at this tournament have thanked their lucky stars. They believe it is a logistical nightmare as a three-to-four week gap either side of the tournament does not allow enough time for proper recovery and a full pre-season, meaning it is likely that some players will come in undercooked and take time to get going or could be overcooked and trail off, potentially due to injuries, as the season wears on.

Oliver Kay: I honestly don't know yet because it's such an unknown. I felt pre-tournament that it could really undermine Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid etc, because no sports scientist would recommend the kind of summer they have had. It might actually work in the opposite way and benefit in the short term, but I think the effects will be felt more in the medium term. Even if they battle on through to May, how many of these players will be in peak condition for the World Cup?

Mark Carey: Actually not that much. I do not agree with FIFA flogging players with too many games at all, but I don't think this summer's tournament will have a tangible impact on the outcome of next season. If there were one thing, it should put more onus on managers rotating their squads a little at the start of the campaign, but otherwise I think its influence will be negligible.

Mario Cortegana: Madrid, the Spanish club to go furthest, will have a three-week vacation, so I don't expect a big impact. I was expecting more in terms of injuries during the tournament, as it was stretching an already very demanding season by almost a month. I do think it could have more damage on clubs in leagues that start the competition earlier.

Jeff Rueter: To Mark's point, I'm very curious if it will be remembered more than a few months from now. Given its branding, one would think this should be a major pillar of the 2025 calendar year. But will Ballon d'Or voters really give outsized considerations to performances in this Club World Cup? Or will this be treated as little more than the most lavish preseason tournament in history for European clubs?

Liam Twomey: It's hard to imagine their Club World Cup exertions helping Chelsea from a physical perspective next season. They're going on holiday while all of their Premier League rivals build up the conditioning that is vital to sustain a 10-month campaign. On the other hand, the collective confidence this triumph — and particularly the manner of their win over PSG — will give everyone at Chelsea could be genuinely transformative.

Felipe Cardenas: Player welfare will remain a talking point and players, coaches, fans and pundits will refer to the Club World Cup as one reason the players may look fatigued in 2025-26. On the flip side, the competition did prepare teams for their trophy quests. When the Copa Libertadores and Champions League rolls around (and other domestic and international tournaments), perhaps we'll see more battle-tested personalities from teams who were in the competition this summer.

James Horncastle: Be less about Infantino, although I understand why this edition was about him. It was the first and it is his baby. So much of the focus was on him and whether or not the tournament worked. There were no other narratives to fall back on. In time, that will change as was the case with the World Cup through the 1930s and 1950s and the European Cup into the 1960s and 1970s.

Jordan Campbell: Lean into continental rivalry. It billed itself as ‘best vs best' and gave many a stick to beat it with after a 10-0 in the second game but the competitiveness of this tournament showed that there is a concept worth pursuing. The South American pride coming up against the wealth of Europe was a strong narrative throughout with all the cultural and stylistic differences it brings. If the Saudi Pro League can provide a few of the Asian representatives in 2029 there should be a third pole capable of competing.

Oliver Kay: See revenue distributed in a way that genuinely benefits the game, rather than just the richest clubs in each region. Before the tournament, Infantino lamented how, in modern football, “the elite is very concentrated in very few clubs, in very countries”, which is certainly true. And yet more than $300million of an (absurd) $1billion prize fund will be split between Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. If Infantino genuinely thinks this helps football's financial inequalities, rather than compounds them, then he hasn't learned much from his time at UEFA. If a huge prize pool was the only way to make it attractive to the biggest clubs, then what does that tell us about the tournament?

Advertisement

Mark Carey: Have better playing surfaces. It has been widely spoken about, but the bounce of the ball — or lack thereof — has been notable from the television coverage, never mind from the perspective of the players. Considering this is being pitched so favourably by Infantino, the very least you should expect in future is a pitch that is befitting of the elite level. This would be a major step forward.

Mario Cortegana: Selling this tournament as if everything has been rosy may have felt necessary to FIFA for the first edition, but for the next one I hope they leave that a little behind. I also hope that during these years they show real interest in improving the schedules to protect professionals and fans from the heat or the quality of the pitches.

Jeff Rueter: Have some sense about kick-off slots. Mid-afternoon games in the American summer looked unnecessarily gruelling. With apologies to my friends in Europe who could catch games in primetime, it did a disservice to players and fans alike.

Asli Pelit: I've got a long list of suggestions echoing my colleagues who touched upon my concerns above. But maybe the place to start is simply asking players and fans: do they even want this tournament to continue? Before expanding formats and squeezing in more fixtures, maybe ask whether we actually need yet another tournament.

Liam Twomey: Make player welfare a bigger consideration than maximising viewer numbers. It feels mildly miraculous that we reached the end of this tournament without a significant player health scare on the pitch, given the brutality of the heat inside many stadiums.

Felipe Cardenas: Never use Freed from Desire as the tournament's soundtrack ever again. I used to like that song.

Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. (0:52)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is in the books, but even as the dust settles after Chelsea's rout of Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final at MetLife Stadium, preparations for next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup -- hosted across the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19 -- are already well underway. Much of what we saw and experienced of the U.S. as a host nation this summer will inform issues in need of fixing over the next 12 months.

ESPN's reporters who covered the 2025 summer tournament weigh in on the glaring needs FIFA can't afford to ignore if next summer's showpiece sporting event is to be one of its best.

Of all issues that affected the Club World Cup, the weather had the biggest impact on the quality of matches. Manchester City played their first group game at noon in Philadelphia, with no sun coverage, and their second at 9 p.m. in Atlanta's air-conditioned stadium. Afterward, Pep Guardiola talked about the matches as if his team had played two different sports.

The intensity of the performance was certainly different in Atlanta. In Philadelphia, City defender Nathan Aké said the pace of the game against Wydad AC dropped when the clouds opened and the sun came out. The heat was that oppressive.

The issue ahead of the 2026 World Cup is that some teams will have to play in early afternoon matches in places like Miami, where temperatures will reach 90 degrees and higher. With so many games to fit in, there's no other way around it. FIFA can't have all the games kicking off late in the evening at air-conditioned stadiums. It's just not viable.

The biggest question facing FIFA ahead of the World Cup is how to make it fair. England's chances of lifting the trophy will be boosted immeasurably if they play most of their games in covered stadiums like the ones in Atlanta or Houston. On the flip side, if Thomas Tuchel's side are asked to play at lunchtime in Miami, they're going to struggle. Think Brazil in 2014, when England finished bottom of their group and went home early.

By hosting a World Cup in the summer in the U.S., FIFA has already agreed to be hostage to the weather, with both hot/humid conditions and thunderstorms capable of delaying games. But with wildly different conditions in different stadiums and venues, it needs to do everything it can to make the tournament as fair as possible. -- Rob Dawson

Most World Cups have taken place during summer in the Northern hemisphere, which makes a bit of heat and humidity par for the course. However, throw in North America's thunderstorms -- which delay games -- and the impact of the weather is going to be potentially next-level. This is where, off the back of the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA needs to be clever in terms of both venues and kickoff times.

With four games each day from June 13-23 and a whopping eight (in four slots) from June 24-26, it won't be straightforward. But FIFA has several cards to play if it is willing to learn from 2025 and not get overly hung up on kickoff times.

Steve Nicol believes there would be no complaints about the weather if it was the World Cup.

Six of the 16 venues are in relatively temperate climates, while another three are climate-controlled. It seems obvious that if you are going to play in the middle of the day, you should do it in those cities, wherever possible.

As for the stadiums most likely to be affected by the weather? Well, they play at night, and if it means kicking off at 10 p.m. local time, so be it. They do it occasionally in Spain's LaLiga, so they can do it here, too. FIFA has to give itself that option.

Maybe at the Club World Cup, there was a desire to put big clubs in the European prime time to boost TV audiences. Well, FIFA doesn't need to do this for the World Cup because unlike its little sibling, there's no proof of concept needed. History shows folks will stay up into the middle of the night or the early morning (let alone daytime hours at work).

The World Cup does not need to cater to TV. What it does need to do, wherever possible, is give players the best possible conditions to do what they do best. -- Gab Marcotti

The United States is a huge country and one that's accustomed to moving people around by rail, road or air, but there is also a built-in acceptance in the U.S. that stuff happens: weather can cause delays or cancellations, the trains don't run on time and the roads, especially in the big cities, can be chaotic. The system works (with glitches), but it will come under immense strain next summer when the U.S., Mexico and Canada welcome fans for a 48-team World Cup.

The biggest issue will be the capacity for air travel. I personally had three internal flights during the Club World Cup, and they were delayed by three hours, 11 hours and one hour.

Trains? They get you to where you want to go, but don't expect to make the relatively short journey from Manhattan to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in under an hour. And both to and from the Club World Cup final, trains were canceled.

Some stadiums are also way out of town, the Hard Rock in Miami being an example of a ground that is really only accessible by car. Next year will be impacted by travel issues, so prepare to be patient. -- Mark Ogden

For U.S. sports fans who regularly visit some of these stadiums -- whether it's New Jersey's MetLife, Miami's Hard Rock or Pasadena's Rose Bowl -- it goes without saying that arriving and departing is often a long and painful process requiring plenty of patience, planning, and above all, time.

Ask anyone who has attended several games at this tournament and they'll have their own ""journey from hell"" anecdote. At the Rose Bowl -- which isn't one of the World Cup venues, instead being replaced by Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium -- a number of journalists, including those with international news agencies, arrived at close to halftime in the stadium's debut match, PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, after getting caught up in traffic jams.

At Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, driving or catching an Uber is no guarantee of arriving before kickoff. The stadium's security perimeter -- set up to prevent a repeat of last summer's Copa America chaos -- is so extensive that a long, sweaty walk in Florida's heat and humidity is required anyway to get to your gate. Even the buses provided by FIFA for journalists -- which worked well at most venues, and really should be the blueprint for an expanded program that caters to fans with tickets in 2026 -- suffered long delays after getting stuck in traffic.

MetLife's location in East Rutherford has long been a bone of contention for New Yorkers. Get caught in rush-hour traffic and the journey by road from Manhattan can literally take hours. Kickoff was delayed in the Real Madrid vs. PSG semifinal after even the teams arrived late. And yes, NJ Transit runs a special train service for events, with the station close to the stadium, but that still involves a change -- and sometimes a long wait -- at nearby Secaucus Junction.

Efficiently getting tens of thousands of fans in and out of stadiums at sold-out sporting events is inevitably complicated. But the lack of adequate public transport infrastructure, coupled with some out-of-town locations, for a number of these venues is going to cause a major headache in 2026 unless FIFA provides additional, free shuttle buses running frequently for fans. -- Alex Kirkland

Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham said the pitches in general ""aren't great at all ... [and] tough on the knees as well. Hopefully someone will look at that going into the World Cup next year.""

FIFA needs to. After all, this wave of frustration follows on from criticism of the surfaces used during last year's Copa America, including Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez labelling the Mercedes-Benz Stadium pitch in Atlanta a ""disaster.""

Five of the venues used at the Club World Cup -- Lumen Field, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field -- will be employed at next summer's World Cup, and there is clearly work still to be done. They are NFL stadiums using artificial turf, incompatible with FIFA's requirement that all its competitions are played on entirely natural grass surfaces. The Club World Cup was an experiment in that regard, as FIFA tried to innovate new techniques to create a hybrid surface, including transporting Bermuda grass overnight in refrigerated trucks to improve the quality.

Furthermore, while many participants complained about the extreme temperatures, stadiums with roofs make it harder to grow and maintain real grass with natural sunlight. Four of the 16 venues next summer -- Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver -- have roofs.

""We'll report after this tournament and take lessons forward to 2026,"" said MetLife pitch venue manager Blair Christensen at the tournament's conclusion. ""These guys here that work on the pitch with me, they are far sharper and better than they were 35 days ago, and we'll take that forward to next year."" -- James Olley

Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup.

The 2025 Club World Cup saw 32 teams from around the globe participate in an extensive competition under extreme conditions, facing intense heat, logging thousands of miles in travel across the United States between games and playing on makeshift pitches to replace artificial grass in certain venues.

While Major League Soccer players entered the competition amid the ongoing 2025 campaign, and with fresher legs given that their offseason runs from early December to late February, most clubs were forced to play just weeks after grueling campaigns: all four Brazilian teams (Flamengo, Palmeiras, Fluminense, Botafogo) had played 70 or more games, with Chelsea and Manchester City clocking in with 57 across all competitions. Exhaustion often showed in the performances, leading to forced substitutions, concern for injuries and, at times, an arguably less intense level of football on the pitch.

It's not over for these players either, with MLS clubs returning to their regular season and European clubs preparing for the 2025-26 campaign. With just one year until the 2026 World Cup, players and clubs missed out on a crucial summer break, and they must now balance avoiding injuries and playing time while still being competitive, with players keen to earn a spot in their national team's roster. We have yet to see whether this tournament will have consequences. Once participating players kick off the 2025-26 campaign and weekly action is underway, players might begin to experience the Club World Cup's lasting impact. -- Lizzy Becherano","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

We all saw what happened when Chelsea won the 2025 Club World Cup on Sunday at MetLife Stadium: There was President Donald Trump standing up there with the winning team and star Cole Palmer looking very confused as to why he was up there.

Nonetheless, Chelsea celebrated, and all was done there, right?

Not so much. According to The Daily Beast, Trump didn't just hold up the trophy at one point on Sunday. He actually kept it for himself. The one that Chelsea captain Reece James held up was a replica.

Seriously! That's what Trump apparently said during the DAZN broadcast:

“They [FIFA] said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [FIFA President Gianni Infantino] said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office,'” Trump explained in a mid-game chat with the broadcaster, DAZN.

Trump apparently also got a medal from Infantino, but it's unknown if he kept it.

Sergio Marchi likens Infantino to Roman emperor Nero

He says staging was reminiscent of ‘bread and circuses'

The president of Fifpro has described the Club World Cup as a “fiction” and compared Gianni Infantino to the Roman emperor Nero, as the dispute between the players' union and Fifa continued to escalate.

Sergio Marchi joined the ranks of those critical of Infantino's expanded tournament, saying a “lack of protection” for players had left the Club World Cup equivalent to “bread and circuses”.

It is understood Fifpro was not invited to a meeting regarding player welfare held by Infantino in New York on the eve of the final, won 3-0 by Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain.

Marchi said the Club World Cup was not without its strengths because it had “generated enthusiasm among numerous fans and allowed some of the world's leading figures to be seen in a single tournament”, but he said it did not represent football well.

“Fifpro cannot fail to point out, with absolute clarity, that this competition hides a dangerous disconnect with the true reality experienced by most footballers around the world,” he said. “What was presented as a global celebration of football was nothing more than a fiction created by Fifa, promoted by its president, without dialogue, sensitivity and respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts.

“A grandiloquent staging inevitably reminiscent of the ‘bread and circuses' of Nero's Rome, entertainment for the masses while behind the scenes inequality, precariousness and the lack of protection for the true protagonists deepen.”

Those “true protagonists” are the players, including those of Chelsea and PSG who will start their new league seasons five weeks after the final.

Last month Fifpro urged Fifa to grant players a four-week rest between seasons. This request has not been taken up, however, with the meeting on Saturday ending with an agreement that three weeks of rest would be sufficient. “There is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period/holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season,” Fifa said.

Fifpro is part of a group of football bodies, including the Premier League, pursuing legal action against Fifa over an alleged lack of consultation regarding the Club World Cup and changes to the international match calendar more broadly.

FifaThe global governing body has said it is “fully within our rights to set the parameters of our competitions whilst respecting the regulatory framework in place”, and the prospect of a legal row was described by Infantino as “futile”.

Fifa said there had been agreement during the meeting at the weekend that the calendar needed to “strike the right balance between national team football and club football, on the one hand, and between domestic, continental, and global club competitions, on the other hand”. The Club World Cup is the only global club competition. Fifa has been approached for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. (0:52)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is in the books, but even as the dust settles after Chelsea's rout of Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final at MetLife Stadium, preparations for next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup -- hosted across the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19 -- are already well underway. Much of what we saw and experienced of the U.S. as a host nation this summer will inform issues in need of fixing over the next 12 months.

ESPN's reporters who covered the 2025 summer tournament weigh in on the glaring needs FIFA can't afford to ignore if next summer's showpiece sporting event is to be one of its best.

Of all issues that affected the Club World Cup, the weather had the biggest impact on the quality of matches. Manchester City played their first group game at noon in Philadelphia, with no sun coverage, and their second at 9 p.m. in Atlanta's air-conditioned stadium. Afterward, Pep Guardiola talked about the matches as if his team had played two different sports.

The intensity of the performance was certainly different in Atlanta. In Philadelphia, City defender Nathan Aké said the pace of the game against Wydad AC dropped when the clouds opened and the sun came out. The heat was that oppressive.

The issue ahead of the 2026 World Cup is that some teams will have to play in early afternoon matches in places like Miami, where temperatures will reach 90 degrees and higher. With so many games to fit in, there's no other way around it. FIFA can't have all the games kicking off late in the evening at air-conditioned stadiums. It's just not viable.

The biggest question facing FIFA ahead of the World Cup is how to make it fair. England's chances of lifting the trophy will be boosted immeasurably if they play most of their games in covered stadiums like the ones in Atlanta or Houston. On the flip side, if Thomas Tuchel's side are asked to play at lunchtime in Miami, they're going to struggle. Think Brazil in 2014, when England finished bottom of their group and went home early.

By hosting a World Cup in the summer in the U.S., FIFA has already agreed to be hostage to the weather, with both hot/humid conditions and thunderstorms capable of delaying games. But with wildly different conditions in different stadiums and venues, it needs to do everything it can to make the tournament as fair as possible. -- Rob Dawson

Most World Cups have taken place during summer in the Northern hemisphere, which makes a bit of heat and humidity par for the course. However, throw in North America's thunderstorms -- which delay games -- and the impact of the weather is going to be potentially next-level. This is where, off the back of the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA needs to be clever in terms of both venues and kickoff times.

With four games each day from June 13-23 and a whopping eight (in four slots) from June 24-26, it won't be straightforward. But FIFA has several cards to play if it is willing to learn from 2025 and not get overly hung up on kickoff times.

Steve Nicol believes there would be no complaints about the weather if it was the World Cup.

Six of the 16 venues are in relatively temperate climates, while another three are climate-controlled. It seems obvious that if you are going to play in the middle of the day, you should do it in those cities, wherever possible.

As for the stadiums most likely to be affected by the weather? Well, they play at night, and if it means kicking off at 10 p.m. local time, so be it. They do it occasionally in Spain's LaLiga, so they can do it here, too. FIFA has to give itself that option.

Maybe at the Club World Cup, there was a desire to put big clubs in the European prime time to boost TV audiences. Well, FIFA doesn't need to do this for the World Cup because unlike its little sibling, there's no proof of concept needed. History shows folks will stay up into the middle of the night or the early morning (let alone daytime hours at work).

The World Cup does not need to cater to TV. What it does need to do, wherever possible, is give players the best possible conditions to do what they do best. -- Gab Marcotti

The United States is a huge country and one that's accustomed to moving people around by rail, road or air, but there is also a built-in acceptance in the U.S. that stuff happens: weather can cause delays or cancellations, the trains don't run on time and the roads, especially in the big cities, can be chaotic. The system works (with glitches), but it will come under immense strain next summer when the U.S., Mexico and Canada welcome fans for a 48-team World Cup.

The biggest issue will be the capacity for air travel. I personally had three internal flights during the Club World Cup, and they were delayed by three hours, 11 hours and one hour. Stormy weather was the reason for two of them and technical issues the other. There will be some delays that cause fans to miss games.

Such disruptions will affect teams, too. Real Madrid had to cancel their semifinal prematch news conference because bad weather forced their flight to be delayed.

          / CBS Texas
        

FIFA, the governing body for international soccer, gave fans the first look Tuesday morning at the process to buy tickets for the 2026 World Cup.

AT&T Stadium in Arlington will host nine games in the tournament, the most of any of the 16 venues spread across the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Four of the matches in Arlington will be in the knock-out stage of the tournament, including one of the semifinals. For fans in North Texas willing to head a bit farther away, NRG Stadium in Houston will host seven matches.

The tournament starts on Thursday, June 11, with matches in Mexico City and Guadalajara. The first game in Arlington will be on Sunday, June 14.

According to a news release Tuesday morning, FIFA will release the tickets in phases, due to anticipated high demand. Fans can apply to win the chance to buy tickets in the first draw starting on Sept. 10, FIFA said.

""There will be several distinct ticket sales phases from the start of sales on 10 September 2025, through to the final match on Sunday, 19 July 2026. Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products, and full details on each phase will be released in the coming months,"" the news release said.

FIFA encouraged those interested in tickets to register on its website and create a FIFA ID. ""This registration of interest ensures they are made aware of ticketing dates, next steps and processes,"" FIFA said.

Anyone attending a World Cup game in Arlington will technically have tickets to Dallas Stadium, as World Cup venues are not allowed to use names of their corporate sponsors.

FIFA decided to use the name Dallas Stadium despite the fact that it's located in Arlington, and that does not sit well with the mayor of the Metroplex's third-largest city.

Arlington Mayor Jim Ross told CBS News Texas the venue should be called Arlington Dallas Stadium.

""It's not a dig against Dallas,"" Ross said. ""It's just essential pride of the city of Arlington and what we have accomplished here in our entertainment district ... It's also an economic impact and we want to optimize our ability to take advantage of that.""

The Dallas Sports Commission has told Arlington leaders that it will address the issue with FIFA this summer.

U.S. President Donald Trump was seen sneakily pocketing a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal onstage moments before he handed Chelsea a replica trophy.

The president was given the medal to look at by Gianni Infantino while handing others out to the winning squad at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium Sunday. Though videos showed Trump later tucked the medal into his suit blazer when the FIFA CEO seemingly reached for it back.

Infantino appeared to shrug off the incident, flashing the thumbs up and allowing Trump to keep the medal.

Eagle-eyed social media users were quick to react to the clip, which went viral over the weekend and following the game, with one labeling the brazen act “The Art of the Steal.” “He didn't play a minute,” complained another.

It comes after Trump himself revealed that the winner's trophy that he had handed to Chelsea captain Rhys James had actually been a replica, and that FIFA officials had given him the real silverware.

Before the showpiece game, held at the 80,000-seat stadium in New Jersey, Trump told broadcaster DAZN that the real trophy currently sits in the Oval Office, after it was gifted to him by Infantino during a visit in March.

“They said, ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office,” Trump said. “And then I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' He says, ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one.'”

“And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting…It's in the Oval right now,” he added.

Soccer fans, and even the players themselves, were also baffled after the president also made no effort to leave the stage after presenting the fake trophy. Star player Cole Palmer (center left) was seen reacting with astonishment as Trump initially took pride of place (Getty Images)

Soccer fans, and even the players themselves, were also baffled after the president also made no effort to leave the stage after presenting the fake trophy – opting instead to stand and clap alongside them.

Star player Cole Palmer, who scored two of Chelsea's three goals in the victory over Paris St Germaine, was seen reacting with astonishment as Trump initially took pride of place next to James.

In a later interview, Palmer admitted: “I knew he was gonna be there but I didn't know he was gonna be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump stood on stage for the FIFA Club World Cup trophy presentation after Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain, 3-0, in Sunday's final. Did he keep the gold trophy?

Chelsea lifted a replica trophy during the FIFA Club World Cup awards ceremony, according to news sources.

The original 24-carat gold-plated gyroscope-like trophy designed designed by FIFA and crafted by Tiffany & Co was presented to Trump by FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a ceremony at the Oval Office.

In an interview with DAZN, the president explained that the original trophy was a gift from FIFA and that Chelsea F.C. held up a replica.

""They (FIFA) said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and (FIFA President Gianni Infantino) said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office',"" Trump said. Adding, “And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now (the original) is in the Oval.”

In a viral video from Sunday's award ceremony, Trump is seen tucking a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal in his pocket after all the others were handed out to the winning Chelsea team members. The video appears to show Infantino reaching back for the medal but then gave him a thumbs-up, allowing him to keep the medal.

According to FIFA, the champions receive a replica FIFA Club World Cup trophy featuring the engravings that mark their triumph after the final that they keep permanently and the original is retained by FIFA.

Similarly, the original World Cup trophy is kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zürich, Switzerland, while the World Cup winners receive a gold-plated bronze replica.

However, according to news reports, Trump has claimed that the trophy was a gift from FIFA president Gianni Infantino and is being kept in the Oval Office at the White House.

The FIFA Club World Cup was hosted by the U.S. over the past month, with the final played a MetLife Stadium on July 13.

New York City and Philadelphia are among the cities that will host the FIFA World Cup next summer, with the final again be played at MetLife Stadium.

Chelsea FC defeated PSG in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup tournament — which featured several games played in Philadelphia — but might that have been the last chance soccer fans here to see the world's greatest players?

Philadelphia is set to be one of the host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but there is a very real chance that FIFA skips America altogether next year.

Will FIFA pull out? Here's what we know.

According to ESPN, there have been enough complaints about the summertime heat across America to cause FIFA players, coaches and the FIFPRO worldwide soccer players' union that FIFA is considering relocating the 2026 World Cup from America.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to begin on Thursday, June 11 and will conclude on Sunday, July 19.

""We clearly believe that from a health and safety perspective, this (extreme heat) is something that must take priority over commercial interests with regards to the safety of the players,"" said FIFPRO spokesperson Alexander Bielefeld in comments included in ESPN's report. ""Heat conditions are not happening in a vacuum. The debate on extreme heat is not happening in a vacuum. It's actually quite foreseeable.""

ESPN also noted that FIFPRO executives suggested canceling FIFA Club World Cup matches in Philadelphia due to the heat, as temperatures went beyond their threshold of 82.4 degrees on the WetBulb Globe Temperature gauge.

According to WeatherSpark, the average temperature in Philadelphia for late June is around 87 degrees.

However, a separate report indicates FIFA officials haven't yet decided to pull the 2026 World Cup from America.

Cristiano Ronaldo posted his instant reaction to Jorge Jesus being confirmed as Al-Nassr's new manager, with another Portuguese brought on board.

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has worked with a fellow countryman in the Middle East before, with Luis Castro spending a little over 12 months with Al-Nassr in 2023-24. Italian tactician Stefano Pioli was the last man to fill that demanding role.

He moved on after failing to land major silverware, with Ronaldo adding just one Arab Champions Cup crown to his glittering CV across two-and-a-half seasons in the Saudi Pro League.

CR7 has committed to a new two-year contract with Al-Nassr, following much speculation regarding his future, and is determined to get back on the trophy trail in 2025-26. He is pleased to have Jesus alongside him - with a “welcome” message being sent on social media.

Jesus has experience of life in Saudi Arabia, having previously led Al-Hilal to a league title, King's Cup success and two Saudi Super Cup triumphs. The 70-year-old has signed a one-year deal after being identified as the man that Ronaldo wanted at the helm.


Jesus has said: “Without his invitation, I certainly wouldn't be there. The motivation will be great. I'm going to try to ensure that Al Nassr, which is one of the best clubs in Saudi Arabia, can win titles. Cristiano Ronaldo is a player who has always won everything he's played for. He hasn't won in Saudi Arabia yet. I'll see if I can help him.”

Ronaldo's record-breaking new contract will take him beyond his 42nd birthday. He has been showing no sign of slowing down - picking up back-to-back Golden Boots in the Saudi Pro League - but needs additions on and off the field in order to satisfy his hunger for silverware.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi is being backed to complete an emotional homecoming transfer to Newell's Old Boys, amid questions of his future at Inter Miami.

Argentine GOAT Messi is yet to extend a contract in South Florida that is due to expire at the end of the 2025 MLS campaign. He does have the option for another 12 months in the United States, taking him through the next World Cup finals.

Inter Miami remain hopeful that a deal can be done there, but Messi is seeing moves elsewhere mooted. Teams in the Saudi Pro League are reportedly ready to reunite the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner with eternal rival and Al-Nassr talisman Cristiano Ronaldo.

A return to where it all began is also being speculated on, with Messi having never shied away from the fact that he would like to make a competitive appearance for Newell's before the day comes to hang up record-breaking boots for the final time.

Close friend and fellow world champion Angel Di Maria has made a similar move, with the veteran winger heading back to Rosario Central at 37 years of age. Claudio Tapia, who was present for Di Maria's unveiling in familiar surroundings, believes Messi could tread the same path.

Argentine FA president Tapia told TNT Sports when asked if Messi will one day return to his homeland and bring a remarkable career full circle: ""I hope so."" Newell's boss Cristian Fabbiani has previously stated that he would like to bring Messi home on a four-month contract.

Messi has offered little indication as to what his long-term future will hold, with the South American superstar currently enjoying a history-making run of form in MLS that has seen him bag a brace in five consecutive matches.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The market opened earlier than usual but not every member of England's elite has taken advantage of it as the 2025-26 campaign fast approaches...

The new Premier League season will get under way at Anfield in precisely one month's time - so how are England's elite shaping up ahead of the imminent resumption of play?

We've already seen a string of sensational signings, with the top teams trying to get their business done as early as possible ahead of what's likely to be a gruelling season, which will be punctuated by the Africa Cup of Nations, and conclude just before the start of the 2026 World Cup.

Of course, the expanded Club World Cup has also contributed to the spate of signings, with FIFA having opened the window earlier than usual to allow participants to strengthen their squads specifically for the tournament.

Indeed, both Manchester City and Chelsea spent big before the action even got underway in the United States, while the latter brought in Joao Pedro for the knockout stage - and to great effect.

But who's looking like potential title contenders right now? And who still has plenty of work to do before the big kick-off at Anfield on August 15? Below, GOAL breaks down the big six's business so far...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ex-Manchester United star Louis Saha has explained why Cristiano Ronaldo will “definitely want Lionel Messi to join him in Saudi Arabia”.

Two eternal rivals with 13 Ballons d'Or between them once locked horns on a regular basis when competing on opposing sides of the fierce Clasico divide that exists between La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.

They have headed their separate ways since then, with Ronaldo recently extending his record-breaking contract in the Middle East with Al-Nassr. Messi, meanwhile, is turning out for Inter Miami in MLS.

He is yet to extend his deal there, despite having an option for 2026, and there has been talk of big-spending teams in the Saudi Pro League readying another approach for the Argentine GOAT.

Saha believes that CR7 would like to see a deal done, with the Portuguese superstar's former Old Trafford team-mate telling BoyleSports - who offer the latest Champions League betting: “Will Cristiano Ronaldo want Lionel Messi to join him in Saudi Arabia? Definitely. Cristiano will want more big players out there and it's starting to get very competitive, we have seen that in the Club World Cup.

“The people in Saudi will want to continue making the league as big as they can. Ronaldo is a competitor and he wants to win, he hasn't won trophies like he would want out there. It would be nice to see the competition within the competition.”

Al-Ahli are the team said to have an offer for Messi ready to go, with the World Cup winner having previously snubbed interest from that part of the world when deciding to go chasing the American dream in 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Blues' FIFA Club World Cup exploits have set them up for future success, with their No.10 the main man in the BlueCo project

""Everyone has talked a lot of sh*t about us all season,"" a carefree Cole Palmer so characteristically proclaimed after Chelsea were crowned champions of the world on Sunday. ""But I feel like we're going in the right direction."" The Blues didn't just beat Paris Saint-Germain, the consensus best team in the world, but absolutely smashed them in the first final of the revamped FIFA Club World Cup, running out 3-0 victors at MetLife Stadium.

Chelsea weren't given much of a fighting chance heading into the showdown in New Jersey. Their run throughout the tournament, compared to the gauntlet that PSG faced, was derided as one more reminiscent of their Conference League campaign. When Levi Colwill and captain Reece James expressed their confidence pre-match, there were claims of 'delusion' thrown their way.

Yet here we are in a reality where Chelsea are basking in the golden glow of world domination, again. The club is in a very different position to the last time they won the Club World Cup in 2022, but are still winners all the same. The critical noises surrounding BlueCo have quietened, and that's largely down to their project's star man.

Palmer scored two of Chelsea's three goals and assisted the other for Joao Pedro inside 43 first-half minutes. He was the tactical wrinkle that not even the great Luis Enrique could iron out, his fingerprints all over the game as PSG were tossed to-and-fro by the west Londoners. Now that he has silverware in his cabinet and enough credit in the bank, we can start talking about Palmer in grander terms.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Galatasaray have rejected Napoli's new transfer conditions for Victor Osimhen to leave him stuck in limbo. The Turkish giants have refused to meet the fresh demands laid down by the Italian champions, putting Premier League clubs on red alert. Osimhen is being strongly linked with a move away from Napoli this summer after he spent a year on loan in Turkey, becoming the top goalscorer in the Super Lig.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz remain the players to beat in men's tennis, having won each of the last seven Grand Slam titles.

Sinner winning Wimbledon is a positive for tennis, although the continued dominance of him and Alcaraz may not be.

They have played out the last two Grand Slam finals, and occupy the top two spots in the ATP Tour rankings, with Sinner at number one.

Rafael Nadal congratulated Alcaraz and Sinner after their Wimbledon battle, which arrived just over a month after their French Open final clash.

Novak Djokovic is the last player outside of the pair to win a Grand Slam, having triumphed at the US Open in 2023.

And their next rival has now been discussed by former professionals John Isner and Jack Sock on the Nothing Major Show.

Offering his most likely player to challenge Sinner and Alcaraz, Isner commented: “I am going to say Taylor Fritz. I think he is the one guy who has the best chance. And I think right behind him I think is Ben Shelton.”

READ MORE: Carlos Alcaraz hailed as ‘pure class' for what he did right after losing the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner

Sock added: “I would say over three out of five at these Slams, I just don't. I would give Fritz an edge over Ben for sure.

“Maybe I would throw an [Alexander] Zverev in with a new potential team around him and potentially some new energy and new motivation out there.

“If he is serving as well as he can and playing well on one of these US Opens, Centre Court or Australia. He would probably be my only guy, probably him and Taylor.”

Also sharing his verdict on the situation was another former player, with Steve Johnson referencing the Big Three in his analysis.

That Big Three of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer once dominated the ATP Tour, and occupy the top three spots for the most men's Grand Slam titles won.

READ MORE: Rennae Stubbs disagrees with commonly held opinion about Jannik Sinner after he wins the Wimbledon title

Djokovic, who just lost his Wimbledon semifinal with Sinner, leads the way with 24, followed by the retired Nadal and Federer with 22 and 20 respectively.

Johnson said: “It is kind of like it was in the Roger, Rafa and Novak era. Who is going to beat both of these guys back-to-back in a tournament?

“Who is going to beat one in the semis and the other in the final? You need somebody to help you out. You need Grigor [Dimitrov] to beat Sinner and then Novak can get through that side if he can and then play his best against Carlos.

“You need some help and some love. But I really don't know if there is a guy who can beat both of them back-to-back in the semis and final.

“That's going to be the biggest hurdle to climb, so you are going to need some help. If you only have to beat one of them I do think a Fritz, a [Jack] Draper, a [Lorenzo] Musetti, a Novak.

“Guys can beat one on any given day, but to beat them on a Friday and Sunday, semis and finals, at a Slam, that is a big ask.”

Like Djokovic, Fritz reached the semis at Wimbledon, but Draper and Musetti fell in the second and first rounds respectively.

There will, of course, be plenty of opportunities for such players to bounce back over the coming years, but whether or not they can reach the levels of the current top two remains to be seen.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

World No 1 Jannik Sinner increased his lead over second-placed Carlos Alcaraz in the ATP Rankings with his Wimbledon title, but the Italian will be under pressure to remain top during the upcoming North American swing.

Sinner has held the No 1 spot for the past 58 weeks as he became the first Italian to climb to the top of the rankings after the 2024 French Open.

The only time he was really in danger of losing his status was when he was banned from February until May, handing Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev an opportunity to overtake him, but they both fluffed their chances with poor displays during the Sunshine Double at the Indian Wells Open and Miami Open.

Alcaraz, though, managed to chip away at Sinner's lead in recent months following an excellent clay-court season and his title run at the Queen's Club Championships, but he was always going to face an uphill task at Wimbledon where he was the defending champion.

Sinner started the grass-court Grand Slam with a 1,130-point lead over his closest rival, and by winning the title, he has increased that advantage to a massive 3,430 points with the other challengers well adrift.

1. Jannik Sinner – 12,030
2. Carlos Alcaraz – 8,600
3. Alexander Zverev – 6,310
4. Taylor Fritz – 5,035
5. Jack Draper – 4,650

But all is not lost for Alcaraz as the tables will be turned during the North American swing as Sinner has a lot of points to defend in the coming months.

The Spaniard had a torrid hard-court campaign 12 months ago as he lost early at the Cincinnati Open and US Open while he didn't compete at the Canadian Open due to the Paris Olympics.

The five-time Grand Slam winner has only 60 points to defend while Sinner will drop 3,200.

The Italian had a summer to remember as he won the titles at Cincinnati (1,000) and Flushing Meadows (2,000) while he also reached the quarter-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Canada (200).

That 3,430-point will thus evaporate pretty quickly, but Sinner will remain at No 1 until at least after the US Open even if Alcaraz wins the Masters events in Ohio and Toronto and it means he is guaranteed another eight weeks at No 1.

Alcaraz has spent a total of 36 weeks at the top of the rankings during four different spells, but he was last No 1 in September 2023 when Novak Djokovic brought an 11-week stint to an end.

The 22-year-old, though, is favourite to finish the season as No 1 as he currently has a 1,500-point lead over Sinner in the ATP Rankings Race To Turin with the standings usually a marker for the year-end top spot.

Sinner finished as the year-end No 1 in 2024 while Djokovic was No 1 in December 2023 with Alcaraz top in 2022.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

 It's time for ATP Los Cabos in stunning Los Cabos, Mexico. It's one of two destinations hosting prime ATP events. The Mifel Tennis Open continues tonight, and I'm here with some best bets for the round of 32. Let me know who you're picking in the comments.  

H2H: 0-0

Alan Magadan and Bu Yunchaokete have never met before their match tonight. Primarily a hardcourt player, Yunchaokete hasn't had the year he was expected to have coming off his rather impressive year in 2024. It's been setback after setback, and he doesn't even have a winning record on his preferred surface. Magadan has had a serviceable year thus far, but the majority of his time has been spent at the Futures level. Magadan is also a hardcourt player, but he's had his success on other surfaces this year.

Best Bet to Make

This one isn't expected to be close. Magadan is checking in as almost a 9.5-1 underdog in this match. Though Magadan has had a decent year, Yunchaokete is expected to be able to have his way with him in this match. For Yunchaokete, it's not a matter of if he wins, but how thoroughly. I don't see any reason why Yunchaokete shouldn't win this match in the 6-2, 6-3 realm. You can grab Yunchaokete under 20 games for 1.56, but I would go a step further and take under 19.5 games at 1.7, and get that little extra.

That being said, Yunchaokete winning under 19.5 is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Yunchaokete winning under 19.5 games @1.7 @Pinnacle

H2H: 0-0

Tonight will be the first meeting between Alibek Kachmazov and Juan Pablo Ficovich. The Russian and Argentinian are at two different places in their careers right now. Kachmazov is currently moving up through the Challenger ranks, but his year has been extremely up and down. He's found more success as of late, including making his first final of the year at the end of April, and he followed that up with a semifinal run. Ficovich has had several finals this year, but he's still looking for his first tournament victory.



Best Bet to Make

The books have Kachmazov as the favorite in this match, and I completely disagree. His form lately has been found wanting. In his last ten matches, he's won four times. Ficovich isn't exactly loads better, but he's 5-5 in his last ten matches, and he was on a three-match winning streak just two matches ago, and one of those two losses was in three sets. At 2.46, I think Ficovich is as live an underdog as you're going to get right now, and that doesn't even account for the age factor here.

That being said,  Ficovich winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Ficovich winning @2.46 @Pinnacle

H2H: 1-3

The last time James Duckworth and Adrian Mannarino met on a hardcourt, the two played an incredible five-match war at the Australian Open, which Mannarino won. In fact, Mannarino has only lost once to Duckworth, and that happened in Stuttgart back in 2021. Neither Duckworth nor Mannarino has had a 2025 to remember. Duckworth is barely above .500 on his preferred surface, and Mannarino is a combined 2-12 on his preferred surfaces. Picking either one of these guys is like betting on Haru Urara, ifkyk.

Best Bet to Make

Even though he's had a worse year and isn't hitting his stride on his preferred surfaces, I think Mannarino has enough experience and knowledge of Duckworth to get the win. It's not even like Duckworth is that much of a favorite; most outlets have this match as a draw. At their highest, they're only .05 points off, and it's only .02 off at their lowest. In a coin flip, bet on the guy who dominates the rivalry and is in better form. The answer to both of those things is Mannarino. He's 8-2 in his last ten matches, with multiple four-match winning streaks. Duckworth is coming off his third loss in a row.  

That being said, Mannarino winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Mannarino winning @2.0 @Bet365

David Goffin announced his return to clay-court action Tuesday with an impressive opening win against #NextGenATP Martin Landaluce at the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad.

The 34-year-old Belgian, who was sidelined through May and June due to a foot injury, prevailed 7-6(2), 6-3 amid windy conditions at the ATP 250 event. After letting slip seven break points in the first set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, Goffin delivered a watertight tie-break and rode his momentum through a two-hour victory.

“It feels great to be back 10 years after my final,” said Goffin, who fell to Dominic Thiem in the 2015 final in Gstaad. “I'm very happy to win my first match after injury on a nice centre court with super nice landscape, it's the best place to come back and win.”



Landaluce was competing in Gstaad through the Next Gen Accelerator, which offers players aged 20 and under increased opportunity to compete on the ATP Tour. The 19-year-old Spaniard, who is the No. 138 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, was aiming for his second tour-level win after winning his first-round match against Jaume Munar at the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami last year.

“This programme allows me to escalate in the rankings more easily because I can play tournaments that I wouldn't be able to without this help,” said Landaluce, who is eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. “I'm very privileged and grateful to have this because this is a nice tournament. I think it's a nice programme and hopefully it can help other young players.”

Goffin will next face Juan Manuel Cerundolo, who earlier defeated last year's semi-finalist Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The Argentine, who reached the final at the ATP Challenger Tour event in Braunschweig last week, used the high altitude to dictate with his heavy topspin forehand in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Struff.

Other winners on Tuesday included seventh seed Francisco Comesana and qualifier Francesco Passaro. Comesana defeated Marco Trungelliti 6-3, 6-4, while Passaro upset eighth seed Arthur Rinderknech 6-1, 7-5.

Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena beat countryman Carlos Taberner 1-6, 6-2, 7-6(5) and Swiss wild card Jerome Kym earned his first tour-level win with a 7-5, 4-6, 7-5 triumph against Calvin Hemery. Alexander Shevchenko overcame former World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka 6-3, 6-2 to reach the second round. Wawrinka reached the final at the ATP 250 event in 2005.

Zvereva bounced back well from her double bagel by Steffi Graf at Roland-Garros in 1988 and became the best doubles player in the world

If Amanda Anisimova is looking for reasons to be positive after the harshness of her first Grand Slam final, then she could do worse than look at the experience of Natasha Zvereva, until Saturday, the only player in the Open era to suffer a 6-0, 6-0 defeat in a Grand Slam final.

The American was understandably emotional after her double bagel against Iga Swiatek in the final at Wimbledon, but spoke well and promised to bounce back strongly.

Anisimova has plenty of reasons to be optimistic, of course. She played brilliantly on grass, reaching the Queen's final before going all the way to the final at Wimbledon, her first in a major. The American's fighting spirit and ball-striking were equally impressive, especially in her semi-final win over Aryna Sabalenka.

Despite the loss, Amanda Anisimova's journey has been incredible.🎾 Announced mental health break in May 2023🎾 Lost in 2024 Wimbledon qualifying ranked No. 189🎾 Won first WTA 1000 title in February 2025🎾 2025 Wimbledon finalist🎾 Will make WTA Top-10 debut in Monday's… pic.twitter.com/8z4N8cYfno



But the experience of Zvereva in 1988 would also be worth her looking at.

In 1988, Zvereva was just 17 when she reached the final at Roland-Garros, stunning Martina Navratilova on her way. The Belarusian – playing under the Soviet Union flag at the time – also took out Helena Sukova but was hammered by a rampant Graf, who, of course, was in the middle of her golden slam year, when she won all four majors and the Olympics.

It was a humbling experience for Zvereva and could have scarred her for life. But it didn't. In fact, she went on to reach at least the quarter-finals of all four slams, and made the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1998, beating Graf in the fourth round before losing in three sets to the eventual runner-up Nathalie Tauziat.

Zvereva also became a brilliant doubles player, winning 80 titles in all, her partnership with Gig Fernandez one of the best of all time. She won 18 Grand Slam titles in women's doubles and two in mixed.

It's also worth looking at what Zvereva did in the immediate aftermath of her 6-0, 6-0 defeat at Roland-Garros. Always good on grass, she reached the final of her very next tournament, in Eastbourne, and made the last 16 at Wimbledon.

On hard courts in North America, she then beat Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver back to back to reach the final in Canada, losing out to Gabriela Sabatini in the final. She lost in the first round at the US Open but made another final, in Worcester (beating Chris Evert along the way) and qualified for the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships, reaching the quarters of the knock-out event.

So in terms of results, there was very little negative impact on Zvereva's career from that Roland-Garros defeat. Anisimova was right to emphasise the positives in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's loss, the American having never imagined she would make a slam final just a year after returning from a six-month break for mental health reasons.

Radwanska: Don

Agnieszka Radwanska, who was the last Pole to make a final here in 2012, said the key for Anisimova was to remember the good things she did on her way to the final.

“Obviously I really feel for Amanda today,” Radwanska told a small group of reporters. “You could really see she was suffering after the match as well, she felt so bad. 

“But well done for her, she made the final here for the first time, and she beat Sabalenka in the semi-final. So I think it was still a great result for her. Hopefully she'll not be thinking about the result for a long time.”

The best tennis players are great at forgetting bad losses, focusing on the good things and moving ahead. Short-term memory loss is a real strength, but if she needs some inspiration, Anisimova can at least look at Zverev and see what can be done.

The American will be ranked a career-high No 7 now, which will ensure her some more favourable draws, in theory, and on hard courts, she should be a real threat. There are also many areas she can improve on and the way she spoke afterwards bodes well for her chances.

“I told myself, I'll definitely come out stronger after this,” she said. “I mean, that's not an easy thing to go through, losing 0 and 0 in a Grand Slam final. (But) if anything, I can look at it as a positive and something I can look at as motivation going forward. Obviously there's a lot of things I need to do to progress.”

Amanda Anisimova is loving the sand at her feet following Saturday's heartbreaking Wimbledon defeat.

Taking to Instagram on Monday, the 23-year-old New Jersey native — who fell to Poland's Iga Swiatek in the ladies' final at the All England Club this past weekend — posted a beachy snap to her Stories while rocking a green Wimbledon cap. She also took in some family time, as seen in a separate videos.

The posts were shared days after Anisimova reached her first-ever Grand Slam final following an upset win over top seed Aryna Sabalenka in the semis.

Anisimova, who had previously taken time away from tennis to focus on her mental health, experienced difficulty settling into the championship match, with her nerves taking over.

Swiatek, a former world No. 1, dominated her American opponent, 6-0, 6-0, in less than an hour.

The win marked Swiatek's first at Wimbledon and her sixth Grand Slam victory overall.

“I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks,” Swiatek, 24, told her Animisova afterward. “Anyways, no matter what happened today, you should be proud of the work you're doing. I hope we're going to play many more finals here and other tournaments. You have a game for that. So, congrats to your team as well.”

Anisimova, whose world ranking soared to a career-high No. 7 as of Monday, expressed gratitude for the support she received at Wimbledon over the past few weeks.

“Thank you everyone for the immense amount of support and kind words, it doesn't go unnoticed,” she wrote Sunday on Instagram.

“‘If you can meet with triumph and disaster, and treat those two imposters just the same' a quote you read before walking onto center court & one I'll be carrying with me.”

Members of the tennis community rallied around Anisimova following the loss to Swiatek, including reigning French Open champion and fellow American Coco Gauff.

“So much to be proud of Amanda keep your head up,” Gauff wrote on X.

Tennis icon Billie Jean King penned on the social media platform, “Congratulations once again to the Champion, @iga_swiatek, and the Finalist, Amanda Anisimova. So much to be proud of here.”

Entering Saturday, Anisimova's best finish at Wimbledon had been the 2022 quarterfinals.

Swiatek's run makes her the 10th different SW19 champion in a row.ByJoel DruckerPublished Jul 15, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 15, 2025

A year ago, following Swiatek's run to the title at Roland Garros, my public belief was that she was ready to make a strong run at Wimbledon. Tempting as it is to say I was simply off by a year, the truth is that in the intervening time, I've been highly critical of Swiatek's competitive demeanor, even to the point of suggesting she fire her entire team. Given that Swiatek only reached the semis of Roland Garros last month after having previously won four titles there and had yet to win a tournament since winning in Paris in June ‘24, I was hardly optimistic about how she'd fare at Wimbledon.But with a run to the finals of Bad Homburg serving as a prologue, Swiatek proved masterful on the grass. From impeccable footwork to superb shot selection decisions and execution, Swiatek smothered opponents with exquisite focus and movement. Her forehand technique was more compact and even the Swiatek serve, a long-troubled motion, had improved significantly. Speaking about her serve following the final, Swiatek said, “For sure I was surprised with the consistency. I knew I can do it before, but I don't think I ever served so well throughout the whole three weeks even.” As those technical improvements kicked in, Swiatek competed with more poise than she'd shown for many months. To see her overcome the distraught moments of recent times was a refreshing reminder of what makes a tennis champion both human—and extraordinary.

For the ninth straight year, a different woman has won Wimbledon. Not since 2016, when Serena Williams raised the Venus Rosewater Dish for the second consecutive time and seventh overall, has a WTA player taken the Wimbledon title at least twice. Why is this the case?One theory is that today's Hologic WTA Tour is so deep that many contenders can surface at any stage of the tournament (after all, the only set '25 champion Iga Swiatek lost came in the second round versus Caty McNally). Another holds that top players these days lack the dominant and wide range of aggression-oriented skills that allowed the likes of Serena, Venus Williams, Martina Navratilova, Stefanie Graf, and Billie Jean King to win Wimbledon frequently. This gets us closer to the heart of the matter.Contemporary tennis, both women's and men's, has a strong defensive quality to it; a tremendous emphasis on east-west movement, mostly across the baseline (as first best demonstrated in the Open era by Chrissie Evert). These were the skills that allowed Coco Gauff at Roland Garros to brilliantly extend rallies long enough to take control of many a rally.But even though grass has gotten much slower in the 21st century, it's still the consummate surface for north-south opportunists (including King, Navratilova, and, yes, McNally) who can quickly terminate a point. In other words, while grass certainly rewards nimble footwork, it can also reduce the value of east-west court coverage. Rallies end sooner. Surprises will happen when a particular player gets hot just long enough to earn an upset. Looking ahead, significant as performing well at The Championships is in the annals of tennis history, don't think that what works on grass necessarily creates a sustainable model for success elsewhere. It's hard to believe there will be as many upsets at the US Open as there were at Wimbledon.

Carlos Alcaraz's dream of winning a third consecutive Wimbledon title came to an end on Sunday evening after losing to Jannik Sinner in the final.

The Spaniard was no match for his long-time rival in their latest encounter, losing 6-4 4-6 4-6 4-6 on Centre Court.

Alcaraz, who also lost to Sinner at Wimbledon in 2022, was ultimately out-performed by Sinner from the baseline and his usual drop-shot tactic did not work as effectively against the agile Italian.

However, Alcaraz is already a five-time Grand Slam champion at 22 years of age, and he has another opportunity to win a major at the US Open in September.

Jimmy Connors, a record-holder of five US Open titles, pinpointed a particular area of Alcaraz's pre-match routine before the Wimbledon final that he would not have done during his playing career.

Jimmy Connors' opinions hold weight when it comes to tennis. An eight-time Grand Slam champion, Connors has a wealth of valuable experience to draw on and share with the wider population.

Connors, who won two Wimbledon titles, was speaking on the ‘Advantage Connors Podcast‘ when the topic of Alcaraz and Sinner's entourages arose.

Speaking to his son and co-host Brett Connors, Jimmy said: “I saw before they walked out on court, I think it was Alcaraz. He was getting ready to walk out on court and he must have hugged seven or eight guys. 

“Your mum told me ‘get out there and play and let's go home.'

“But they were hugging seven or eight guys in their camp. You have this guy and that guy, who is going to do this and that. To the point where I would have looked at that as a distraction.

“They look at that now differently. They look at that now that everybody is there for a reason and they have a purpose.”

Despite losing on Sunday, Carlos Alcaraz can take great confidence heading into the US Open in August, a place where he is a former champion.

Alcaraz had not lost any of his previous Grand Slam finals heading into Wimbledon, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in those finals.

Despite that confidence, Jannik Sinner remains the clear favourite for the title. He has won three hard-court majors to Alcaraz's one, most recently capturing the 2025 Australian Open title.

The US Open will be contested by Alcaraz, Sinner and many others between August 24 and September 7.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

It's no secret that Prince George is enthusiastic about an array of sports.

He's accompanied his father, Prince William, to numerous football matches, and is also said to be a huge fan of rugby, scuba diving, and tennis.

On Sunday, the 11-year-old made a rare appearance as he joined his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and his sister, Princess Charlotte, at the Wimbledon men's singles final.

Ahead of the show-stopping tennis match between Jannik Sinner and defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz, Prince George made a rare public comment about his own racket skills.

It's Wimbledon and over on The HELLO! Royal Club, royal shopper Leanne has delved into Princess Kate's Wimbledon wardrobe and offered some predictions on what the fashionable royal might opt for this week.

During a discussion with Wimbledon doubles champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, Cash asked George if he was any good at tennis, to which George replied: ""I'm all right.""

It's a passion that runs in the family, with Princess Charlotte also showcasing an interest in the sport.

The Princess has joined her family courtside on several occasions, with the youngster also securing a very special keepsake following this year's Championships.

After the gripping match, footage showed sibling duo George and Charlotte chatting with Jannik. Charlotte held up two tennis balls, which the Wimbledon champ then proceeded to sign with his autograph. Take a look in the video below...

As she thanked the Italian athlete for signing their balls, saying: ""Thank you so much, that's very kind of you,"" Charlotte handed him a third tennis ball for their younger brother Louis, who couldn't attend. ""They've brought one for their brother as well,"" the Princess of Wales explained.

The racket sport is also said to be a firm favourite of William and Kate's, though the royal couple have admitted that their competitive spirit can sometimes get in the way.

During a previous appearance on Mike Tindall's The Good, The Bad and The Rugby podcast, Zara's husband jokingly said to Kate: ""I'm not going to say you're uber competitive, but…"", which prompted Kate to reply: ""I'm not competitive at all.""

After the conversation veered towards tennis, the mother-of-three went on to reveal: ""I don't think we've actually managed to finish a game of tennis"", adding that the game ""becomes a mental challenge between the two of us.""

Kate reportedly took tennis lessons at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham when she and Prince William lived at Kensington Palace. She also played doubles alongside Swiss great Roger Federer ahead of the 2023 Wimbledon tournament, and teamed up with British star, Emma Raducanu, in 2021 at a homecoming celebration, hosted by the Lawn Tennis Association.

At the time, Emma said of Kate's tennis skills: ""Her forehand was incredible. I was very impressed. It was a lot of fun to play tennis with the Duchess.""

Jannik Sinner recently revealed that fellow Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek was the driving force behind their participation in one of the tournament's most treasured off-court traditions, the Champions' Dance.

While the two Grand Slam winners were initially told the performance wasn't necessary due to the late hour, Świątek insisted they honor the ritual, ultimately convincing Sinner to step onto the dance floor.

Held on the final Sunday evening of The Championships, the Champions' Ball has long been a celebratory staple at Wimbledon. Traditionally, it brings together the newly crowned men's and women's singles winners, along with champions from other categories, for an evening, away from the intensity of Centre Court.

Both Sinner and Świątek earned their maiden Wimbledon singles titles this year, making their joint appearance at the ball even more special.

Sinner arrived in a classic black suit, crisp white shirt, and matching tie. As the top seed, the Italian outclassed a formidable field, taking out Luca Nardi, Aleksandar Vukic, Pedro Martínez, 19th seed Grigor Dimitrov, 10th seed Ben Shelton, and seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic, before avenging his Roland Garros defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

Świątek, meanwhile, stunned spectators with a dominant run that culminated in a flawless 6-0, 6-0 win over Amanda Anisimova in the championship match. Dressed in a pearl blue Stella McCartney satin gown, the Polish star celebrated her sixth career Major and her first on grass, ending a year-long title drought.

After the event, a now-viral video showed Sinner and Świątek laughing and enjoying a dance together at the Champions' Ball.

 

 

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)



The delightful dance moment came to light when the BBC shared a behind-the-scenes video where Sinner opened up about how it all came together.

“Yes, I mean, we were there and in the beginning they told us that we, because it was quite late, that we don't have to do it,” Sinner said in the clip.

“And then Iga told me, ‘No, no, let's do it.' I was like, ‘Okay.' It's tradition, so it's good to make that happen. And yeah, it was nice to share this moment with Iga and it's, yeah, a beautiful moment.”

Jannik Sinner says Iga Swiatek convinced him to do the Wimbledon Champions' dance:

“They told us that we don't have to do it because it was quite late. Then Iga told me ‘No, no.. let's do it.' I was like okay.” 😂

Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka will both be contending at the US Open, which is the next Grand Slam tournament on the horizon.

Swiatek has just won Wimbledon, her sixth Grand Slam title and first since Roland Garros in 2024.

This was another major tournament without a title for world number one Aryna Sabalenka, who was beaten by Amanda Anisimova in the semifinals.

Now, former top 10 player Jack Sock has given his prediction about which of Swiatek and Sabalenka he thinks is more likely to win the US Open.

Despite Swiatek's resurgent Wimbledon title victory, Sock actually believes Sabalenka is more likely to win the US Open this year.

Sabalenka is the defending US Open champion, and Sock has suggested that she will be hungry to end her Grand Slam drought in 2025.

“All credit to Iga but I think I am probably going to ride with Sabalenka as the favourite for the US Open,” Sock said on the Nothing Major podcast. “I think she has proven on all surfaces she can play so big and dominant and blow women off the court in some of these matches with her aggressive play.

“I would side with Sabalenka probably. But Iga not far behind at all. And if not equal favourite for some of these. But I think Sabalenka will come out swinging and have a big purpose come New York and the US Open.”

Swiatek won the US Open in 2022, and Steve Johnson responded by explaining why he thinks she is now fully back in the picture for the biggest titles.

“I think she is definitely going to be talked about in that category again,” said Johnson. “She has not won a title in a year until this point. Iga has firmly planted herself back in the conversation of winning these titles with the other women in the draw.

“Her forehand was immensely better. It felt like she hit it cross court 95% of the time and she was never going to miss and then ultimately just dominated with her backhand.

“Her movement is insane on the grass. It's such a weapon, especially on the women's side. You feel as if she is one of the only few women who are sliding on a grass court and moving like that.”

The first time that Swiatek played Sabalenka at a Grand Slam tournament was in the semifinals of the 2022 US Open.

Despite Sabalenka being up a break in the third set, Swiatek won the match, 3-6 6-1 6-4, to reach the US Open final.

After the match, Sabalenka admitted in her press conference that she made a mistake against Swiatek.

“Well, she was just going for it,” Sabalenka said at the time. “She was hitting every ball and, like, putting me under pressure and playing really aggressively.

“Especially, like, I gave her a lot of opportunities in the first few games. She, like, after she leads 2-Love, then she was just going for it and I was just trying to come back. There was less pressure on her, more pressure on me.

“She was playing aggressively, and I was trying to stay in the game, which was my mistake, I think. I should just go for it.”

That is one of only two times that Swiatek has played Sabalenka at a Grand Slam, with the Belarusian getting revenge at Roland Garros this year.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The Spanish former world number two has worked her way back into the top 10 this year after a string of injuries, including a chronic lower back issue, had left her contemplating retirement.

Badosa lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 to Katie Boulter in the first round of Wimbledon earlier this month, and in a statement on Monday said she had suffered a tear in her psoas, the muscle which connects the lower back to the top of the leg.

""These are really challenging times for me but I'm staying hopeful that things will turn around soon and the light at the end of the tunnel will start to shine through,"" Badosa said, adding that the injury had occurred before Wimbledon.

Amanda Anisimova had the best Grand Slam finish of her career at The Wimbledon Championships, and though she fell short to Iga Świątek in the final, the American tennis star is taking away some unmatched memories and lessons for her next major of the season.

""It was such a remarkable experience for me, and making it to the first Grand Slam final and it being at Wimbledon was a surreal feeling,"" the 23-year-old said in a new interview with ""Good Morning America.""

""Even though it didn't go the way I would have wanted it to go, my opponent obviously was was playing some great tennis, and I've had to compete against so many incredible athletes throughout the entire fortnight,"" she continued.

Despite her runner-up finish, Anisimova has since jumped up the WTA rankings, breaking into the top 10 for the first time at No. 7.

""It feels so surreal to be ranked [No.] 7 right now -- it's my career high and what a quick turnaround for me,"" she told ""GMA.""

Anisimova added that there were larger takeaways, like having her family present and ""getting to experience that moment with me,"" which she called ""incredibly special.""

""Getting to meet Kate Middleton after the final at the ceremony, there were so many special moments and so many other things that I can take away apart from the performance in itself,"" she added.

The New Jersey native took a hiatus from the professional circuit in May 2023 until January 2024 to focus on her mental health and said that ""it's been quite the journey coming back.""

""The most important thing for me since coming back has honestly been doing everything on my own terms and just enjoying the moment,"" she said. ""And that's what I told myself coming out into Wimbledon. I was just incredibly excited to just be playing in the main draw, because I didn't make it last year.""

Anisimova made history as the youngest American woman singles player to advance to the Wimbledon finals -- after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka -- since Serena Williams.

""Getting to play on on Centre Court and winning against the most incredible athlete in tennis right now was super special to me and just an exhilarating feeling,"" she said. ""It'll last me a lifetime of memories for sure.""

The iconic All England Lawn Tennis venue brought with it some very posh quirks, including champagne bottles popping mid-match that prompted officials to silence spectators.

""That was like the 15th time, so I think that my reaction was valid -- it was just a reminder of where I was,"" Anisimova recalled. ""It felt very English -- but it was a funny experience for sure. And then after the match, I was able to laugh about it afterwards, of course.""

With the final major of the season just over a month out, Anisimova said she's excited to return to Queens and get on the courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

""The U.S. Open is my favorite tournament by far. It's always super exciting to be playing there, and I'm sure I'll have the whole home crowd cheering for me over there,"" she said. ""Again, all of my family is going to come and support me -- I am sure it's going to be a great tournament. And hopefully I can go far again.""

Sabalenka is the current defending women's singles U.S. Open champion.

Anisimova has competed five times in the main draw. Her best U.S. Open finish was reaching the third round in 2020.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Has Novak Djokovic 'sort of hinted' where he will make last Grand Slam appearance?","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/novak-djokovic-retirement-prediction-made-rennae-stubbs","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 10:00:59 GMT","

Former doubles world No 1 Rennae Stubbs has predicted that Novak Djokovic could call time on his legendary tennis career at the Australian Open.

Djokovic was beaten in straight sets by eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the semi-final of Wimbledon last week, with the Serbian appearing to be hampered by an injury issue sustained in his quarter-final.

The former world No 1 claimed the injury began to trouble him during the first set of his 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 loss, though after the match denied rumours it was his final appearance at the All England Club.

“I would be sad, but hopefully it's not my last match on the Centre Court. I'm not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today,” said Djokovic, a seven-time Wimbledon champion.

“So I'm planning to come back definitely at least one more time, play on the Centre Court for sure.”

Despite Djokovic's insistence that he will return to Wimbledon in 2026, questions about his long-term future have lingered in recent days.

Tennis legend John McEnroe questioned how willing the 38-year-old would be to remain a “notch or two” below the likes of Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, and now six-time doubles Slam winner Stubbs has had her say.

Speaking on the Rennae Stubbs Tennis Podcast, the Australian suggested that Djokovic could call time on his career at the Australian Open, where he has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam titles.

“I think he has sort of hinted that the last Grand Slam will be the Australian Open,” said Stubbs.

“And I think the reason for that is because it has been his most successful, winning it [10] times.

“I think it's not a bad way for him to go out if he decides to. It has clearly been the best place for him to win a Grand Slam. If he can get to 25, that is probably where he is going to do it.

“I thought his best chance was at Wimbledon, that has slipped away, but I think he probably almost feels that the Australian has been so mercurial in his life, he has had so many dramatic moments in his life, where he was treated very poorly by the Australian government.

“So it's an interesting dichotomy, but I think that is where he wants to finish his career, and that is where I think probably will be his last Grand Slam.”

Jannik Sinner and Darren Cahill make coaching confession after Wimbledon title triumph

Djokovic's 10 Australian Open singles titles are a record for a male or female player in the Open Era, with the Serbian winning his first major title at the tournament back in 2008.

The Serbian then won three straight titles from 2011-13 and back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016, before further triumphs from 2019-21, and his most recent triumph in 2023.

Djokovic was beaten in the 2024 semi-final by eventual champion Sinner, his first defeat in an Australian Open semi-final, while he retired injured at the same stage versus Alexander Zverev this January.

Alongside Sinner, the 38-year-old is one of just two men to reach the last four of every Grand Slam tournament this season, though he was also beaten by the Italian in straight sets at Roland Garros.

Djokovic currently looks set to return to action at the Canadian Open, with the 38-year-old on the provisional entry list released this week.

He is a four-time champion at the tournament, but has not competed at the event since a third-round defeat back in 2018.

Amanda Anisimova said her fighting spirit was what had carried her through to the 2025 Wimbledon final.

It's that same fighting spirit she'll need to lean on more than ever in order to move beyond her last match of the tournament.

Anisimova confronted Iga Swiatek in her first Grand Slam final and was beaten 6-0 6-0 by the Polish superstar, who improved her own record in Slam finals to a perfect 6-0.

It was the first Wimbledon women's singles final since 1911 to feature a double bagel, and just the second Grand Slam final to be determined by that scoreline in the Open era.

In her post-match press conference, Anisimova was realistic when analysing the defeat, yet determined to use the experience as an opportunity for growth.

“It was a bit tough to digest obviously, especially during and right after. It's not how I would have wanted my first Grand Slam final to go,” she said.

“I think I was a little bit in shock after, as well. But I told myself, ‘I'll definitely come out stronger after this'. I mean, that's not an easy thing to go through, losing 0 and 0 in a Grand Slam final.

“If anything, I can look at it as a positive and something I can look at as motivation going forward. Obviously there's a lot of things I need to do to progress.”

Until that point of the tournament, Anisimova had enjoyed a brilliant run.

She opened her own campaign with a 6-0 6-0 win over dangerous grasscourter Yulia Putintseva, then showed outstanding grit and fighting spirit to hold off Dalma Galfi and 30th seed Linda Noskova in back-to-back three setters to reach the quarterfinals.

There, she survived a late fightback from Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to set up a semifinal with world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, whom she outplayed on Centre Court – in another intense three-set affair – to reach her first major final.

Even before the nerves of a maiden Grand Slam final kicked in, she was already physically drained.



The empty tank could have contributed to her serving performance; she landed less than half of her first serves and won just 26 per cent of first-serve points.

Anisimova was clear all these areas of her game required attention as she moved forward.

“I think, if anything, it's my physicality that I need to work on,” she said.

“To be able to last two weeks in a Grand Slam is definitely something that you need to work a lot on. It's not an easy feat.

“There's a lot of room for improvement. I think it's more experience for me on how to handle nerves. It's my first slam final, so at least I have that experience now.

“I don't really know what was going on with my serve… I'm sure me and my team will get to the bottom of it. It's definitely something that I need to work on because I feel like the last two weeks I've dug myself out of so many holes because I've been struggling so much on my first serve.

“To honestly make it to the finals of Wimbledon with a mediocre serve… I obviously have to look back at film, but I feel like I've been fighting my way through with an average serve.”

With her run to the Wimbledon final, Anisimova rises to a career-high ranking of world No.7 – her top-10 debut.

Her first WTA 1000 title in Doha, a trip to the fourth round at Roland Garros and a finals appearance at Queen's have been other highlights in 2025, during which Anisimova has won 31 of 44 matches.

Just 23 years of age, Anisimova has already been forced to contend with the death of her father, and eight months out of the game in 2023 to address her mental health.

Her incredible strength of character is already obvious, and this resilience will help stand her in good stead as she navigates the next step forward in her career.

“When I got back to the locker room, I kind of had that switch in my mind of: ‘You know what? This is probably going to make you stronger in the end,” Anisimova said, “and to not really put myself down after today and just try and focus on how I can come out stronger after this.

“I think it's honestly, like, a fork in the road. It's whatever direction you want to go in. I'm going to choose the path of working towards my goals and to try and keep improving, hopefully put myself in more positions and opportunities like today.

“I think that's going to help me reach my goals.”

Emilio Nava brushed aside the testing conditions on Monday evening in Los Cabos to deliver a commanding opening-round win at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo.

The 23-year-old American fired 31 winners in his 7-6(4), 6-3 triumph over Australia's Aleksandar Vukic, securing his first hard-court victory since reaching the second round at the same event last February. With his win, Nava is up five spots to a career-high No. 118 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next play sixth seed Buyunchaokete or qualifier Alan Magadan.

“I guess they say ‘Smile through the pain',” Nava said in his on-court interview. “It was super humid, super hot, my shirt was drenched, but I was just having fun out there, just getting after it. I love coming to Mexico to play, especially in Los Cabos. I'm happy to be back, and hopefully I can go for more.”



Fellow American Aleksandar Kovacevic also made it safely through to the second round at the hard-court ATP 250 on Monday evening. The 26-year-old, who is seeded at an ATP Tour event for the first time, snapped his seven-match losing streak by overcoming Hady Habib 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.

Kovacevic reached consecutive quarter-finals in Los Cabos in 2023-2024 and now owns a 5-2 record at the event, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The seventh seed will next face wild card Luis Carlos Alvarez or James McCabe.

Mexican wild card Alex Hernandez rallied in the early hours of Tuesday morning to defeat Taro Daniel 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 for his second tour-level win. The World No. 493 trailed 3-6, 2-5 before he pulled off a stunning turnaround to score the biggest win of his career.

Hernandez's first ATP Tour victory came at this venue in 2022, when he defeated Nicolas Barrientos in three sets. Into the second round this year, the 26-year-old will face top seed and 17-time ATP Tour champion Andrey Rublev.

Juan Pablo Ficovich also earned his second career win on the ATP Tour, and first since January 2022, by defeating Alibek Kachmazov 6-3, 6-2 in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. The World No. 148 has set a second-round meeting with fourth seed Quentin Halys.

The world No. 1 has fallen just short of the title at all three majors in 2025.ByJoel DruckerPublished Jul 15, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 15, 2025

For the third straight major, Aryna Sabalenka has learned the hard way that when you're ranked No. 1, everyone seeks to play their best possible tennis versus you. In the Australian Open final, Sabalenka was overcome by an inspired Madison Keys. At the same stage of Roland Garros, she was beaten by a tenacious Gauff. In the semis of Wimbledon, Sabalenka's experience withered in the face of a sparkling effort from Amanda Anisimova. Each of these losses was a three-setter, certainly a testimony to Sabalenka's own brand of resilience and ball-striking skills; but perhaps also, a demonstration of the way she goes about competing.Even now, having improved her mental approach to match management, Sabalenka's matches remain emotional rollercoasters. The sulk, the pout, the anguish—all richly and humanly on display. Endearing? Perhaps. Productive? Questionable. To her credit, though, Sabalenka is aware of the paces she puts herself through. “I mean, losing sucks, you know?” she said following the Anisimova match. “You always feel like you want to die, you don't want to exist anymore, and this is the end of your life. But then you sit there a little bit, and you think about what you could have done differently on the match. I mean, you see stuff where you wasn't at your best in the match. You see that the other player perform much better. You kind of, like, can see things better.” No one ever said life at the top was easy.

Three recent US Open champions—Gauff ('23), Emma Raducanu ('21) and Naomi Osaka ('18, '20)—did not reach the second week at Wimbledon. Gauff was beaten by 42nd-ranked Dayana Yastremska in the first round.“Obviously I'm not going to dwell on this too long,” Gauff said, “because I want to do well at US Open. Maybe losing here first round isn't the worst thing in the world because I have time to reset.”Raducanu won her first two matches, including an excellent victory over '23 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, before competing well versus Sabalenka—a loss that was also a certain kind of victory. As Raducanu said following that match, “it gives me confidence to kind of have pushed the best in the world to play some really good points and really good rallies.”Osaka was far more critical of herself. “I'm just going to be a negative human being today,” she said after a third-round loss to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. “I'm so sorry. I have nothing positive to say about myself, which is something I'm working on.” My sense, though, is that Osaka was mostly caught up in the moment and will soon enough be primed to bring all she can this summer on hardcourts, the surface where she's won all four of her majors.

McLaren CEO Zak Brown is looking forward to seeing more racing on track between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Zak Brown has insisted that handling the relationship between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both on and off the track is an “enjoyable” task for McLaren rather than a “problem”, with the CEO hopeful that the pair's rivalry will continue until the end of the season.

The Woking-based outfit have enjoyed an impressive first half of the campaign, having built a whopping 238-point lead in the Teams' Championship, while Piastri and Norris are now some way ahead of their rivals in the Drivers' standings.

This also saw the two papaya cars collide for the first time at the Canadian Grand Prix, before spending much of the following race in Austria locked in a fight for the win.

Asked during the British Grand Prix weekend about how he was finding the task of managing the intra-team battle between McLaren's drivers, Brown responded: “Pretty awesome.

“I thought Austria was an epic race – everyone's been kind of waiting to see that race between the two of them and they were on it, they were fast, they were aggressive, they gave each other racing room and it was very exciting, so I'm looking forward to seeing more of that.”

In terms of whether it is a case of ensuring that Norris and Piastri keep things clean on the track – and still remain amicable off it – Brown admitted that he is keen to see more close racing between the two right down to the wire.

“It's not a problem,” Brown said of handling the situation. “It's quite enjoyable, and they want to race fairly. They just want equal equipment, fair treatment, which is exactly what they get, and they want to beat 19 other cars, their team mate included, so it's a pleasure to work with them.

“They've got a tremendous amount of respect for each other – how you see them conduct themselves, that's how they are behind the scenes.

“I think a lot of that is the chemistry that we've built in the team, and I see no reason why it can't come down to Abu Dhabi and I hope the two of them are battling it out, and when it's all said and done they shake hands and say, ‘Job well done' and go again next year.”

Fernando Alonso has given an insight into the impact that Adrian Newey has had on the Aston Martin team, with the Spaniard admitting that the squad are ""learning"" from their new Managing Technical Partner.

Fernando Alonso has admitted that the Aston Martin team are “all learning” from Adrian Newey, with the two-time World Champion conceding that the design chief has a “much wider view of how the team should operate”.

Newey started in his new position as Managing Technical Partner of the Silverstone-based squad in March, months after it was confirmed that the Briton would join the team following his departure from Red Bull.

During the British Grand Prix weekend, Alonso was quizzed on how much he has been speaking with Newey, leading the Spaniard to give an insight into how the famed designer is already having an impact on Aston Martin.

“We had a couple of lunches together,” Alonso said of Newey. “Generally [focused on] things about the team, about the simulator, how to make things a little bit more realistic, and he has a lot of experience [of] how a top team should fight for championships and try to be on top of the game in every area.

“It's not only the aerodynamics. When we think about Adrian, it is all aero performance; I think Adrian has a much wider view of how the team should operate, so we all learn from him every time that we speak with him.”

It is no secret that Newey has been focusing his attentions on preparing for 2026, a year in which a new wave of technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.

Alonso himself is set to remain onboard through next year – but, when asked if he is already thinking about what his future might look like beyond 2026, the 43-year-old responded: “No, not really. Not in my mind now.

“The decision will be made next year, I think, around summer time or before to have things clear as soon as possible. Right now, the championship is challenging this year. We didn't start as competitive as we thought, and now we want to turn the situation [around].

“We want to finish the second part of 2025 as strong as possible. Then 2026, everything remains to be seen. Step by step, and [it's] impossible to think right now into 2027.”

Aston Martin currently sit in eighth place of the Teams' Championship, tied on 36 points with seventh-placed Racing Bulls.

With Valtteri Bottas having been linked to Alpine, Pierre Gasly has given his take on the speculation.

Pierre Gasly has labelled the rumours linking Valtteri Bottas to Alpine as “a lot of noise”, with the Frenchman suggesting that the team need to “just focus on the work ahead” as they try to take steps forward.

The Enstone-based outfit have already made changes to their line-up this season, having opted to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto from Round 7 in Imola onwards.

It was then recently revealed that Alpine have enquired about the availability of Mercedes reserve driver Bottas, should they decide to make any further alterations either this year or beyond.

With the squad having faced a difficult campaign so far – which has left them at the bottom of the Teams' Championship on 19 points, 10 adrift of Haas in ninth place – Gasly was asked during the British Grand Prix weekend about the Bottas speculation and whether it could be useful for Alpine to have another experienced driver onboard to act as a benchmark.

“I don't think that's the case,” the 29-year-old responded. “I think it's a lot of noise. I think the car, I'm showing every weekend what we can do with it, doing a very good job on Saturdays and putting it in places that on paper we all agree we should not really be.

“It's just tricky, it's a very tight midfield and we are at the back of it. There will always be noise, especially considering what happened earlier in the year, but I think at the end of the day we should just focus on the work ahead.

“It's going to be a long season. We don't have upgrades, the car is not in the best place, but all of us need to focus on what we've got to do and try and do it the best way that we can.”

Pushed on whether the car is actually the main issue, rather than the drivers, Gasly acknowledged that the incredibly fine margins across the midfield are also a key factor in the challenge Alpine face.

“It's easy to make it sound more dramatic than it is,” he explained. “I think it's just a very tough field. You look a couple of years back, being eight [or] nine-tenths off the fastest car would put you sixth, seventh on the grid.

“This year being eight [or] nine-tenths slower than the fastest car puts you on the back row. I think everyone has done a very good job, we know the strengths and weaknesses of our package. We don't have the strongest car, we don't have the strongest engine – both combined doesn't put us in a very good spot.

“But I see a lot of good stuff happening in the team in terms of trying to get the maximum we can. We know the focus is on 2026 and it comes with some compromises on this year, which are tough to take, but hopefully we see the dividends next year.”

A suspect stole ""water marked music, some unreleased music, footage plans for the show and past and future set lists,"" according to an Atlanta Police incident report. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


	Unreleased Beyoncé music and other sensitive documents have been stolen in Atlanta after thieves allegedly broke into a rental car for the superstar's choreographer and one of her dancers last week. 


	According to an incident report reviewed by The Hollywood Reporter, the alleged theft took place on the evening of July 8, less than two days before Beyoncé started her four-night run at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Per the report, choreographer Christopher Grant and dancer Diandre Blue told authorities that they parked their rental car at a parking deck and left at just past 8 p.m., and that by the time they came back an hour later, they saw someone had broken in through the trunk and took two suitcases.

	The suspect had stolen hard drives that contained “water marked music, some un-released music, footage plans for the show and past and future set lists.” Also stolen were various clothing items, AirPods Max headphones and MacBook laptops.

	According to Atlanta's local ABC affiliate WSB-TV, which first reported the news of the theft, Atlanta Police have also issued a warrant for a suspect's arrest. Per the APD, police dusted the rental car and found two prints. A security camera caught video of the incident. According to the incident report, police used Find My to track the location of the AirPods and laptops, leading authorities to locations redacted on the report. One of the officers wrote in the report that they'd conducted a “suspicious person stop” in the area the AirPods were pinging from.

	











	The theft isn't the first bit of drama to hit the Cowboy Carter Tour these past few weeks; last month, one of Beyoncé's hometown Houston shows was briefly paused after a scary malfunction with her prop car caused the vehicle to tilt in midair.


	A representative for Beyoncé didn't respond to THR's request for comment. The singer plays her final Cowboy Carter Atlanta show this evening.

Director Steven Leckart uses the film, which will stream on Paramount+, to explore fandom at its best and worst. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	A new documentary about rapper legend Eminem is headed for a limited run on the big screen.


AMC Theatres has come aboard to distribute Stans in the U.S., and has committed to playing the doc in more than 135 of its domestic locations beginning Aug. 7 and ending Aug. 10. Overseas, Trafalgar Releasing will release the doc at the same time in more than 1,600 theaters across 50 markets.




	The pact follows in the wake of AMC directly distributing Taylor Swift's concert pic The Eras Tour and Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé.

	The Eminem-produced doc (trailer, below) opened the inaugural London edition of the SXSW festival earlier this year, and is inspired by the artist's 2000 iconic song “Stan,” about an obsessive, unstable fan who takes his admiration for the rapper too far.

	In London, director Steven Leckart described how he flipped the music documentary format on its head. Stans film follows not just the musician's artistic trajectory but that of his most loyal superfans, with the doc “offering an entertaining and vibrant look at the modern nature of fandom and how social media has irrevocably changed the relationship between artists and their audience.” (The term “Stan” was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017).


	Leckart said after the premiere during a Q&A: “I was raised on hip-hop in the '80s and '90s, and I grew up on MTV. So I witnessed [Eminem's] rise's first hand and I was a fan, but I think I just kept coming back to the song ‘Stan' and really thinking about how unconventional it was and still is.”

	











	He continued: “I just saw an opportunity to make an unconventional doc … We've seen a glut of docs that are just so straightforward and standard. And so this is a beautiful opportunity to do something different.”


	Other producers include Paul Rosenberg, Stuart Parr, Antoine Fuqua, Tony DiSanto, David Schiff with DIGA Studios in association with Shady Films, Fuqua Films, Interscope Films, and MTV Entertainment Studios.  Bruce Gillmer, Amanda Culkowski and Michael Maniaci are Executive Producers for MTV Entertainment Studios.


Stans will be available on Paramount+ internationally later this year. Stans: The Official Soundtrack, which will feature previously unreleased tracks, is already available for pre-order.

The Swede spoke with THR in front of an audience at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, which was honoring him with its Crystal Globe for Outstanding Artistic Contribution to World Cinema.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Last Friday, the veteran Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard reflected on his life, career and latest project — Joachim Trier's Cannes Grand Prize-winning dramedy Sentimental Value, in which Skarsgard plays a veteran filmmaker who has a complicated family life — during a recording of The Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter podcast in front of a packed house at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic.


	The 74-year-old, who was in town to receive the fest's highest honor for an individual, the Crystal Globe for Outstanding Artistic Contribution to World Cinema, had the crowd enraptured and often in stitches. He discussed how he broke into the biz when he was just 16. He dished on colorful collaborators ranging from Ingmar Bergman to David Fincher. And he dissected his varied adventures in art house films (e.g. his five collaborations with Lars von Trier, most notably 1996's Breaking the Waves), studio movies (e.g. installments of the Dune, Mamma Mia!, Pirates of the Caribbean and MCU franchises) and prestige TV (e.g. the 2019 limited series Chernobyl, for which he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy, and the 2022-2025 drama series Andor).

	But Skarsgard seemed most passionate and proud when discussing Sentimental Value, which many — including yours truly — feel showcases his best performance yet. In it, he is both hilarious and heartbreaking as Gustav Borg, a stubborn Norwegian director who for years neglected family in order to focus on his career, but late in life, after his ex-wife's death, tries, in his own way, to make things right with his two daughters (played by the brilliant Renate Reinsve and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), while also pursuing what will probably be his last outing as a director, with a Hollywood starlet (a wonderful Elle Fanning) in the leading role.

'Chrisley Confessions 2.0' will debut Wednesday, 49 days after the Chrisleys were released from prison via a President Trump pardon.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Fresh out of the clink, Todd and Julie Chrisley are back in the free world — and in the free-to-listen podcast world.


	Thanks to a pardon by President Trump, the Chrisleys have returned home; and soon, their Chrisley Confessions podcast is returning as Chrisley Confessions 2.0 via a new exclusive multiyear deal with PodcastOne, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Chrisley Confessions 2.0 will premiere Wednesday, July 16.




	PodcastOne knows best, we guess.

Chrisley Confessions had been on hiatus for two years — for good reason. In 2022, Todd and Julie were convicted on 12 counts of bank fraud and tax evasion; Julie was given a seven-year prison sentence, Todd got 12 years. Trump pardoned them in May 2025 following a campaign spearheaded by their daughter Savannah, who is also a PodcastOne personality (Unlocked With Savannah Chrisley).

	The original Chrisley Confessions podcast launched in 2018 with Todd and Julie, the stars of reality series Chrisley Knows Best.


	“The duo returns to the mic to speak directly to their audience about faith, family, personal growth and the journey of rebuilding their lives since their headline-making presidential pardon — unfiltered and on their own terms,” the logline reads.

	











	And, you know, presumably the whole prison thing.


	“This next chapter is rooted in grace, growth and truth. Whether you've supported us, criticized us or simply watched from afar, we're inviting you to listen with an open heart. This is our story, told in our own words. It's honest, unfiltered and just the beginning,” said Todd Chrisley.


	One week before Todd and Julie were pardoned and released from prison, Lifetime greenlit a new unscripted series focused on the Chrisleys. It signaled that something was up.


	“We are excited to welcome Todd and Julie back to PodcastOne and support them in sharing their voices once again,” Kit Gray, president of PodcastOne, said in a statement sent to THR. “Chrisley Confessions has always resonated with audiences for its authenticity, vulnerability and signature Chrisley humor — and we know that listeners and advertisers are anxious for the show relaunch and hearing firsthand from Todd and Julie.”

The second season of HBO's genre hit racked up a lot of noms, including best lead acting nods for Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal (despite his rather limited screen time).

The Last of Us season two might have divided fans, but the new episodes were clearly a hit with Television Academy voters. 


HBO‘s post-apocalyptic drama earned 16 Emmy nominations on Tuesday morning. While that's fewer than the first season's 24 noms, it still represents a terrific haul.




	Perhaps the most interesting nomination is that Pedro Pascal was nominated for best actor. While Pascal's performance was widely praised, his character Joel had very limited screen time, appearing in only three of the season's seven episodes. The nomination is similar to Brian Cox's nomination for the final season of HBO's Succession, where his character was killed off in the season's third episode.

	Several other actors scored Emmy guest actor noms: Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, Jeffrey Wright as Isaac, Kaitlyn Dever as Abby and Catherine O'Hara as Gail.  


	The other Emmy nominations for The Last of Us include best production design, casting, picture editing, contemporary makeup, prosthetic makeup, music supervision, nonfiction short (for a making-of documentary), sound editing, sound mixing and special visual effects.


	Some snubs include Isabela Merced's performance as Gina, the writing categories and the directing categories (particularly Mark Mylod, who helmed the season's second episode, “Through the Valley,” which was the episode submitted for four of the received nominations).

	











	Here's a list of nominations in key categories for the 77th annual Emmy Awards.

The switch-up comes months after the pop star left her longtime manager Roger Gold earlier this year.

Camila Cabello has new management, as the the pop star has signed on with Full Stop Management, a source familiar with the matter confirms to The Hollywood Reporter. 


	Cabello will be managed by Jeffrey Azoff,  Tina Kennedy, Maria Chon and Gian Mitchell, the latter of whom came over with Cabello from previous management. Cabello officially joined Full Stop last month. The move comes months after Cabello had parted ways with her longtime manager Roger Gold, who also co-founded the record label 300 Entertainment. With Full Stop — the superstar management company headed by Irving and Jeffrey Azoff  — Cabello joins a stacked roster that also includes Harry Styles, Tate McRae, John Mayer and U2 among others.

	A rep for Cabello couldn't be reached. Cabello just wrapped a successful European leg of her Yours, C tour in Europe, and she will continue the tour with dates in Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia and Brazil from August through September 14. 




			Related Video		







	Cabello's new management deal comes just over a year after she released her fourth solo album, C, XOXO, back in June of 2024. That album was her first at Universal Music‘s Interscope after she departed from Sony's Epic Records, which had released her three other solo albums. C, XOXO debuted at Number 13 on Billboard's 200 Albums chart, her only album to open outside of the top 10.

	











	Cabello remains the most successful solo act from the girl group Fifth Harmony, where she got her start after the group formed on The X Factor back in 2012. She left the group in 2016. Cabello's first two solo albums are both platinum-certified and had the massive hits “Havana” featuring Young Thug and “Señorita” with Shawn Mendes, both of which have surpassed at least 2 billion streams on Spotify. 


	As Cabello moves into a new chapter in her career, there could be movement from the rest of her former Fifth Harmony members as well. As THR first reported back in May, the group, minus Cabello, have been in talks to reunite, with a tour and documentary potentially in the works.

The singer's ""Ordinary"" blocked the rapper's ""What Did I Miss?"" from debuting in the top spot.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	It's no ordinary day when one of the biggest rappers in the world calls you out, but Alex Warren is taking Drake‘s recent diss in stride.


	In response to Drizzy's comments about the TikToker's smash hit “Ordinary” blocking the former's “What Did I Miss?” from debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week, Warren posted a tongue-in-cheek video of himself Monday (July 14) on Instagram Stories. In the clip, he dances along to Drake's “Nokia,” staring innocently into the camera as he shakes his hips to the lyrics, “Baby girl/ Let me see you do your dance, let me see you twirl.” 


	In lieu of a caption, Warren simply tagged Drake's username. “Nokia” also happens to have never reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, debuting at No. 10 in March before eventually climbing to No. 2 the following month.

	











	Warren's response comes shortly after the Canadian superstar expressed his disappointment with debuting at No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart dated July 19. On his Story, Drake wrote earlier on Monday, “Suppressor on the 1 spot.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I'm taking that soon don't worry one song or another,” he added at the time, sharing a graphic of the U.S. chart's top 10, which showed “What Did I Miss?” sitting just below Warren's “Ordinary” at No. 1. 


	Though Drake may not be happy with the position of “What Did I Miss?” on the charts this week, the track still earned him a record-extending 81st top 10 hit on the Hot 100. He also now has 359 total entries on the ranking, more than any other artist in history.


	Plus, “Ordinary” has proven pretty hard to beat. Warren's breakthrough hit has spent a total of six weeks in the top spot, dethroned only temporarily by Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” spending one week at No. 1 in late June.

	











	Warren is currently fresh off the release of “On My Mind” with ROSÉ, which followed his Jelly Roll duet, “Bloodline.” Both tracks will appear on Warren's new album, You'll Be Alright, Kid, which drops Friday (July 18).

The rapper's potential witness list is 63 names deep, while UMG's lists just nine people. Check out the major names here.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



As the evidence collection process gets underway in Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over the Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” Drake's legal team has included some high-profile names on a surprisingly long list of potential witnesses.


	Drake's so-called “initial disclosure” filing lists 63 people and entities whom he believes have evidence that could help his bombshell case against UMG. The document is dated June 2 but wasn't made public until Monday (July 14) as an attachment to Drake's motion to subpoena a man named Kojo Asamoah, whom the rapper claims was involved in paying bots to artificially inflate streaming numbers for “Not Like Us.”


	While inclusion on this list doesn't necessarily mean someone will be deposed or called to testify at trial, the individuals and companies named here could be asked to hand over documents to Drake's legal team as part of the evidence discovery process.  




			Trending on Billboard		







	The central allegation of the lawsuit is that UMG plotted to boost the popularity of Lamar's chart-topping Interscope Records track, in which he called Drake a “certified pedophile.” UMG, which also owns Drake's label Republic Records, vehemently denies the claims as “meritless.”


	To that end, Drake's initial disclosure names lots of UMG employees as potential witnesses in the case. But beyond seeking information from the people who handle music marketing on a day-to-day basis, the Canadian rapper seems to believe the conspiracy went all the way to the top of UMG, since he names CEO Sir Lucian Grainge as a source of information about “all causes of action” in the case.


	And Grainge isn't the only UMG bigwig on the list. Also named are Universal Music Publishing Group chief Jody Gerson, Interscope CEO John Janick and Republic co-founders Avery Lipman and Monte Lipman.


	Drake has not accused Lamar himself of defamation, and the Los Angeles rapper is notably absent from Drake's potential witness list. But he does name multiple high-profile people and businesses associated with Lamar, including former Top Dawg Entertainment president Dave Free and manager Anthony Saleh.


	As Drake's lawyers look for evidence of an alleged conspiracy to inflate the popularity of “Not Like Us,” the list states that streaming platforms like Amazon Music, Apple, Deezer, Soundcloud, Spotify and TIDAL should share details about UMG's “promotion and licensing of the defamatory material” and “use of covert tactics to promote the defamatory material.”


	Social media sites like TikTok, Twitch, YouTube and Instagram are also named as sources of this same information, as is Billboard.


	Drake's list targets live events as well. A number of the possible witnesses are entities involved in the production of Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime show performance, which, according to an updated version of the lawsuit, included a rendition of ”Not Like Us” out of an alleged desire to “assassinate the character of another artist.”


	Lawyers for the Canadian superstar say the NFL, Fox and Roc Nation could all have information about the “decision to play the defamatory material at the 2025 Super Bowl.” Drake is seeking similar details from the Recording Academy, asking what actions UMG took “to have the defamatory material featured at the 2025 Grammy Awards,” where “Not Like Us” swept up five trophies.


	UMG's initial disclosure is also attached as an exhibit to the Monday motion. The music giant's witness list, dated March 24, is significantly shorter than Drake's by a factor of seven. It names just nine potential witnesses, including Drake and various record executives.


	Unlike Drake, though, UMG's potential witness list also names Lamar himself.


	“Lamar is likely to have discoverable information concerning the creation of the recording, image and video, and the distribution and promotion of the recording and video,” write UMG's lawyers.  


	Reps for UMG and Drake's legal team both declined to comment on the witness lists on Monday.


	These revelations come amid a wait for a decision on UMG's motion to dismiss the case outright. Judge Jeannette A. Vargas in New York federal court held a hearing at the end of June on the question, and her upcoming ruling will determine whether or not Drake's claims are legally viable enough to move forward.

""You would not believe how wasteful this industry is,"" the pop star says.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Billie Eilish has long been leading the charge against the music industry's negative impact on the environment — and in an interview on an upcoming episode of The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper, the singer-songwriter looks back on the positive changes she's been seeing since she started speaking up.

	











	In an exclusive clip shared with Billboard from the singer's conversation with CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir, Eilish opens up about the culture shock of going from growing up in an eco-conscious household to becoming famous in an industry marked by overabundance and excess. Eilish's mom and fellow climate activist, Maggie Baird, also joins her for the interview.


	“We were meeting different brands, and I was going to go on tour and making perfume and my own clothing line,” Eilish recalls of the early years of her career. “We learned how much unbelievable waste is going on that we don't really know is happening.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We stepped into this other world, and it was a little bit like, ‘Oh my gosh, what is happening here?'” Baird added incredulously. 


	The mother-daughter duo go on to say that the music industry didn't have any sort of “plan” for minimizing its eco footprint back when Eilish first found fame around 2016 — but now, they say it's changing for the better. “You would not believe how wasteful this industry is,” the nine-time Grammy winner says in the clip. “They then started making plans, because we would yell at them. We would demand a plan.”

	











	“I was raised to feel this way, but I think I also have my mom's gene of really caring about the world and animals and not wasting things,” Eilish adds.


	For years, the musician has been a fierce climate advocate. In addition to working with fashion brands such as Nike and Oscar de la Renta to create vegan designs and partnering with environmental nonprofit REVERB on tour, the star launched her very own climate summit, Overheated, in 2022. She's also been a key player in carrying out the initiatives of Support + Feed, an organization founded by Baird in 2020 with a mission to fight climate change and food insecurity.


	Eilish and Baird's segment on The Whole Story echoes what both women previously spoke with Billboard about last year. Recalling how “bleak” it was to take meetings with record label executives who couldn't even speak to their companies' sustainability efforts — or lack thereof — the singer pointed out how wasteful unethically sourced merchandise and album variants can be.


	“It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right, and I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable,” she said at the time. “Then it's some of the biggest artists in the world making f–king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more.”


	In that same interview with Billboard, Baird praised Universal Music Group for coming “a long way” in its environmental practices since Eilish signed to them nearly a decade ago. The live music industry has also been making strides, from Lollapalooza implementing a battery-powered hybrid system for its main stage to Coachella debuting a zero-carbon stage in 2025. 

	











	Eilish is just one of a few musicians featured on the latest installment of The Whole Story, which will premiere at 8 p.m. ET on July 20. Titled “Change Amplified: Live Music and the Climate Crisis,” the episode will also include first-hand accounts from Bonnie Raitt, Jack Johnson, Perry Farrell and AJR's Adam Met about how they're personally working to revolutionize the music industry's approach to environmentalism.

Only 10 original songs from Pro Skater 3 and 4 survived the update.

Tony Hawk is addressing fans' concerns about the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, which arrived last week as a modern-day revival of the skateboarding video game classics.

	While the updated compilation delivers reimagined levels, a fresh roster of skaters and new gameplay features, it's the soundtrack — long celebrated as a cornerstone of the franchise's cultural impact — that has sparked the most heated reactions.

					Kesha Makes Chart-Topping Debut With New Album '. (Period)'		
	



	07/14/2025	








	When Activision unveiled the tracklist back in May, fans were quick to voice disappointment that only 10 original songs from Pro Skater 3 and 4 survived the update. The absence of certain fan-favorite tracks, like Alien Ant Farm's “Wish,” ignited frustration online, with many arguing the nostalgic music defined the games as much as the skating itself.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In a new interview with the BBC, Hawk defended the decision, explaining that curating the soundtrack was a collaborative process, not solely his call. “These days, just what I think fits and what I'm interested in [makes the soundtrack],” Hawk said, adding that he wasn't “the only decider” in shaping the final list.


	Still, Hawk revealed he successfully pushed for the inclusion of artists he's personally excited about: “I did manage to throw a couple of bands in that I was stoked on – Fontaines D.C., Idles. I also picked songs by artists that were already in the game, but a different song.” Seven artists from the original soundtracks — including KRS-One, Agent Orange, De La Soul, and Iron Maiden — returned with new tracks to maintain a sense of continuity.

	











	“Not everyone agreed with that decision, but I feel like ‘let's keep it fresh' and also ‘here's help discovering other music,'” Hawk continued. “In the beginning, that's what people expected of it – once the soundtrack became such a prominent part of the game, people were like ‘okay, what are you going to throw at us now,' almost like an underground radio show.”


	Alien Ant Farm recently weighed in on the exclusion of “Wish,” telling fans they were “disappointed” by its omission after the track's association with Pro Skater 3. Hawk responded diplomatically, saying: “We're trying to make room for new acts and new songs as well. Not everything makes the cut. It's nothing personal, and I appreciate that people have a fondness for that song… so just fire it up on your streaming service if you're so inclined.”


	The Pro Skater series has long been credited for introducing players to underground and alternative music scenes, with soundtracks that often mirrored skate culture's raw energy. The 2020 reboot of Pro Skater 1+2 debuted at No. 1 on U.K. game charts and brought a mix of legacy and new tracks that largely satisfied longtime fans.


	With Pro Skater 3+4, the developers aimed to strike a balance between honoring the series' legacy and evolving it for a new generation of players. The updated playlist leans heavily into contemporary punk, hip-hop, and hardcore artists, alongside the handful of returning classics.


	Whether the new approach will win over skeptical fans remains to be seen, but Hawk remains confident in the game's spirit: “I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride.”

	The Emmys are beloved among top-tier award shows for announcing their nominations at a reasonable hour, for the most part. Now that all of the nominations are out, this morning there are some initially eupeptic and caffeinated would-be contenders who just didn't get any love from voters at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.


	They might be taking a celebration swig or two at Apple TV+'s Severance, HBO Max's newbie The Pitt, Netflix's Adolescence and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Mendendez Story, plus Season 3 of HBO's The White Lotus right now. Those near-sure bets heard their names repeatedly among the nominations for the sprawling 124 categories for the 77th Primetime Emmys unveiled Tuesday by Brenda Song and Harvey Guillén – as did Dying for Sex‘s Michelle Williams, The Residence's Uzo Adudb, and The Studio's Seth Rogen.

	











	On the other hand, even with the “bit about a bit” banter between the Running Point and What We Do in the Shadows actors, there certainly were some notable absences.

No noms for Running point in comedy and multiple noms The Bear as a comedy says everything about what's wrong with the process and the criteria.

Seems not just the Academy but all of the awards shows seem to be snubbing Taylor Sheridan and all of his shows which this has been happening for years but yet no one has made a fuss about it like they do when others get snubbed.  Yeah 1923 got several small nominations but they were in lesser known categories that most people don't even realize are there.  Seems odd that one of the most viewed shows Yellowstone didn't even get any nominations in their final season even though they qualified and that could just be because the Academy was upset with Kevin Costner leaving but the show even without Kevin got record numbers so that should have not made a difference.

Glad Four Seasons didn't get nominated. The Four Seasons got so much press — but I couldn't understand why.  Not one likable character on that show. Horrible rich shallow people with no problems whining about their lives.

What about House ot The Dragon totally ignored? I can buy Season 2 was not universally loved, but so was The Bear Season 3, with its worst season to date.

Not one single nomination for THE PERFECT COUPLE?
Especially Donna Lynne Champlin?
And not one mention of the show in an article about snubs?
Talk about a snub.

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


HBO and its streaming service HBO Max smashed past Netflix to once again lead the number of Emmy nominations, thanks to hauls from shows including The Penguin, The White Lotus and The Last of Us.


	The Warner Bros. Discovery network scored 142 Emmy nominations, compared to 121 for Netflix.


	This marks the most Emmy nominations HBO has ever received in a single year, beating its previous total of 137 in 2019. Last year, it received 91 and was behind Netflix and FX. 


	It was helped in large part by major hauls from The Penguin, which landed 24 nominations – the second most of the year behind Apple's Severance, which got 27, The White Lotus, which checked in with 23, and The Last Of Us, which got 16. Hacks helped with 14 nominations and The Pitt looked after 13 nominations.

	Netflix won't be unhappy, however, beating its 107 nominations from last year to put it in second place, thanks to big mornings for Adolescence, which got 13, 11 noms for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and 10 for Black Mirror.


	Apple also had a great morning, scoring 79 nominations thanks to 27 noms for Severance and 23 noms for The Studio. If you add commercials, the company added two more noms. 


	Disney scored 128 nominations across all of its platforms including ABC, Disney+, FX, Hulu and Nat Geo. Disney+ grew from 19 nominations last year to 28 nods this year thanks to a massive haul from Andor as well as some love for Agatha All Along and some documentaries such as Beatles '64.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Chris Pine (Star Trek), Lily-Rose Depp (Nosferatu), Kelvin Harrison Jr. (Mufasa: The Lion King), and Doona Bae (Rebel Moon) are new additions to the cast of Alpha Gang, the alien invasion comedy from the Zellner Brothers (Sasquatch Sunset).


	Character details are under wraps. As previously announced, Cate Blanchett, Léa Seydoux, Dave Bautista, and Riley Keough will also star. 


	When the project was announced in October 2024, Channing Tatum, Zoë Kravitz, and Steven Yeun were also in the ensemble, though they've since fallen out for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Sources attributed it to a combination of factors including scheduling that are constantly in flux for a great many indie film packages.

	











Alpha Gang follows a group of alien invaders sent to conquer Earth. Disguised in human form as a 1950s leather-clad biker gang, they are ruthless in their mission… until they succumb to the most toxic and contagious human condition of all: emotion.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Zellner brothers are producing for ZBi, along with Blanchett and Coco Francini for Dirty Films, Keough and Gina Gammell for Felix Culpa, Ryan Zacarias for Fat City, Andrea Bucko for Sugar Rush Pictures, Mary Aloe for Aloe Entertainment, and Joshua Harris for Peachtree Media Partners.


	mk2 films is repping international sales, having launched pre-sales last year at the AFM, with CAA Media Finance representing North American distribution rights.


	Best known for starring as Captain Kirk in the recent Star Trek films, Pine is coming off of projects like his directorial debut Poolman, Don't Worry Darling, and Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, and is represented by CAA and Gendler, Kelly & Cunningham.

	











	Most recently garnering critical acclaim for her starring role opposite Nicholas Hoult and Bill Skarsgård in Robert Eggers' Nosferatu, Depp is repped by CAA, Markham, Froggatt & Irwin, Agence Adequat, and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols.


	Recently tapped for the role of Beetee in The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, Harrison Jr. is coming off turns in films like O'Dessa, Mufasa: The Lion King, Chevalier and Elvis, as well as the Nat Geo series Genius: MLK/X. Also soon to be seen playing Jean-Michel Basquiat in the indie Samo Lives, he is repped by WME, Anonymous Content, and Del Shaw Moonves.


	A South Korean star with credits like Jupiter Ascending, Sense8, and Rebel Moon, Bae is represented by WME and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


BBC Studios is “really committed to Doctor Who and is continuing to look at ways in which we can bring the show to fans,” according to its CEO Tom Fussell. 


	Speaking after the publication of the BBC Annual Report, Fussell stressed the “crucial” nature of BBC Studios' partnership with Disney along with the strength of Doctor Who, coming with the BBC-Disney+ Doctor Who deal hanging in the balance and following eyebrow-raising comments from ex-Doctor Ncuti Gatwa over the weekend.


	“Fans love the Doctor Who brand,” Fussell said today. “It's been that way since before I was in short trousers.”

					After Numerous Scandals, BBC Boss Tim Davie Says He's Had A ""Tough Period"" But Is Going Nowhere: ""This Job Is Not One You Take If You Want A Quiet Life""		
			








	Fussell celebrated Disney as a “key partner of ours” that works with BBC Studios on hits including Bluey, Dancing with the Stars, Tucci in Italy and “a decade's worth of natural history.” “They are a crucial partner and we share a lot of the same values so I'm really proud of the way that relationship has worked,” he added.




			Watch on Deadline		







Doctor Who has been in the spotlight since Russell T Davies' regenerated second season of the sci-fi series aired to below-par ratings and some middling reviews, leading to fevered speculation that Disney+ will not extend the splashy co-pro deal beyond two seasons, which is currently up for discussion. Over the weekend, 32-year-old Gatwa told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Show he is “getting old” and “my body was tired” when queried over why he left Doctor Who after two seasons. While calling it “the most amazing job in the world,” Gatwa described Doctor Who as “strenuous” and said it “takes a lot out of you physically, emotionally and mentally.” 

	











	One of BBC Studios' strongest relationships with Disney is over Bluey, America's most-streamed show, which BBC Studios said today helped drive record revenue and profit of £2.2B and £228M respectively for the commercial arm.


	Fussell said BBC Studios' move to finance the upcoming Bluey movie is “one of the biggest investments” made during his tenure.


	He pointed to other recent success stories such as the £255M acquisition of the half of BritBox International that BBC Studios didn't own.


	BritBox itself delivered big profits last year – driving a plus-40% soar in revenue for BBC Studios' media and streaming division – and Fussell said the best-of-British streamer has a “unique ability” to help the BBC by acting as co-producer on shows like Ludwig and The Other Bennet Sister.


	“Our mandate is very clear, we are there to make longer-term sustainable growing financial returns and to use the BBC's values as a way of doing that,” he added. “[BritBox] has that added advantage of being a very powerful route to market for British shows, which would be very hard to fund if it wasn't for BritBox.”


	More direct-to-consumer plays in a similar vein to BritBox or the powerplay to charge American audiences for news content could be incoming soon, according to Fussell, with today's Annual Report saying  BBC Studios is “working actively to further develop direct routes to market as part of a strategy to establish sustainable growth for the business” amid “challenging trading conditions.”


	Fussell acknowledged that what the BBC has termed a scripted funding crisis is a consequence of those “challenging conditions” and said “the industry needs a bit of help” to overcome the problem, which he added is not just limited to the drama genre.


	“I would go back and say it hit kids and family first, then UK comedy, now it's hitting drama and natural history is also a challenge,” he added. “Our job is to take risks and our producers are doing amazingly at pivoting our budgets to get them down a bit. Smart people are looking to pivot their slates to get them back into the sweet spot of [shows costing] between £1M and £3M per hour because that's probably where you have to go, but even then it's hard.” 


	BBC Studios returned £391M to the BBC last year and is well on track to hit its £1.5B five-year returns target by 2026-27, Fussell said.

The makers of Doctor Who need to remember what type of show it was that allowed it to run for decades- it was SCARY! Generations of viewers were frightened by it! Now it's silly and glossy colours.
If the BBC wants the show to continue, it needs to be brave and frighten children (and some grown ups) again!

Gatwa's comments about being too old are ridiculous when you consider he's one of the younger actors and one actor 20 years older than him – Peter Capaldi – stayed with the show even after undergoing knee surgery and would have stayed longer had the new producer not decided to change the show fundamentally.

Indeed.

Capaldi is 67.

Gatwa is just 32.

			By Lynette Rice, Peter White, Dessi Gomez 


	Newcomers like The Pitt, Paradise, Nobody Wants This and The Studio secured nominations for Outstanding Drama and Comedy Series for the 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Tuesday.


	That also led to nominations for Noah Wyle (The Pitt), Sterling K. Brown (Paradise), Seth Rogen (The Studio) and Kristen Bell and Adam Brody (both for Nobody Wants This). The freshman breakouts joined legacy competitors like Abbott Elementary, Hacks, Only Murders in the Building in comedy and The Diplomat and Slow Horses in drama.


RELATED: ‘Squid Game,' Diego Luna, & Elisabeth Moss Snubbed In Emmy Nominations; Beyoncé & Martin Scorsese Prove Surprises


	TV Academy chair Cris Obrego kicked off the nominations by saying it received a record turnout of voters this year.


	Overall, Severance was the most nominated drama with 27, followed by limited series The Penguin with 24. The Studio and The White Lotus followed with 23 noms apiece. Hacks gathered the most nods in comedy with 14.


	Limited series will be a compelling competition to watch, as Netflix's Adolescence with 13 noms will duke it out against Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The Penguin, Dying for Sex and Black Mirror. The high quality of some of those limited series led to nominations for Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Stephen Graham (Adolescence) and Cooper Koch (Monsters).

	Among the first surprises of the morning was that Late Night with Seth Meyers was nudged out of the Outstanding Talk Series category, while The Voice missed out in Outstanding Reality Competition Program as Survivor returned to the category after missing out last year.

I wish other shows, the ones not on the critics radar, would get nominations, such as Amazon's clever “Devil's Hour”, Hulu's beguiling Mr. Inbetween or Britbox cops dramas Blue Lights or The Responder. Some of the performances in these were amazing, especially Martin Freeman's performance as a depressed cop in The Responder. 

Glad to see Adolescence make the list at least

Let Dance Mom on Hacks win EVERYTHING!   

“I need you to boof it to me”

Disappointed in the guest actor category. Guest star do not mean star names only but academy members are star struck by celebrity names to vote based on acting performances.

Hence the actress in The Studio

So we're still pretending The Bear is a comedy, huh? mmmmkay

This is such a joke. So to be nominated you have to be famous!? The guest actor is proof of this. So shameful.

lol what do you think Guest Actor means?

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


Bella Ramsey received their second Emmy nomination Tuesday morning, making history as the first non-binary performer to earn more than one nom from the Television Academy.


	Ramsey is one of five nominees in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for their performance as Ellie in Season 2 of HBO‘s The Last of Us. They also were nominated for the same role at the 75th Emmy Awards in 2023.


The Last of Us scored 16 nominations for the upcoming 77th Emmy Awards, bringing the series' total to 40 across two seasons. The series won eight golden statuettes in 2024.


	There have been few openly non-binary and transgender performers to be nominated at the Emmy Awards. In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson declined to submit for the acting categories at the Emmys because the categories are separated to recognize male and female actors separately.

	In recent years, gender non-conforming actors have increasingly advocated for the elimination of gendered categories at award shows. However, Ramsey recently defended gendered awards categories, explaining that they felt it was important “recognition for women in the industry is preserved.”


	Based on Naughty Dog's award-winning video game, The Last of Us takes place 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal and heartbreaking journey as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.

	











	Season 2 picks up five years after the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","James Gunn's Superman launches a universe, not a character","https://www.avclub.com/superman-launches-a-universe-not-a-character","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The following contains spoilers for Superman.

Back in 2013, Zack Snyder ended his divisive Man Of Steel with a scene that teased a brighter future: Henry Cavill's newly debuted Superman slips on some thick-framed glasses, walks into his first day at The Daily Planet, and shakes hands with a Lois Lane who already knows his secret identity. It's a concept the rest of the increasingly convoluted DCEU never really took advantage of (Clark wound up battling Batman and becoming a zombie instead). But it's notable that James Gunn's new Superman reboot starts by picking up that abandoned thread.

If you ignore the change in actors, tone, and costuming—and the addition of one ill-trained superdog—Gunn's Superman could almost be a direct follow-up to that Man Of Steel epilogue. As the movie opens, David Corenswet's Clark Kent has been operating as Superman for three years. He's got some prestige at The Daily Planet thanks to his exclusive “interviews” with his own alter ego. And he's three months into a relationship with a Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) who knows he's a superhero. Finally, a modern Superman movie that explores what it's like to try to live a normal life when you also happen to be the strongest man on Earth! 

Except, while Gunn's sunny, optimistic take is a breath of fresh air compared to the grim and gritty Snyderverse that preceded it, it doesn't really take advantage of its own setup any more than that Man Of Steel epilogue did. We only see Clark in his bumbling, glasses-wearing reporter persona for about three minutes before that thread is dropped entirely. And for a movie about a guy whose main superpower is being invulnerable, Corenswet's Superman spends a weirdly large amount of the runtime writhing on the floor in pain while others handle the heroism. 

Though Superman may bear one hero's name, it's clear Gunn is as enthralled with launching a shiny new hero-filled DC Universe as he is telling a Superman story in particular—which, ironically, is the same problem the last DCEU ran into. (Gunn took over as the co-chairman of DC Studios in 2022, and this is the first movie in his relaunched cinematic universe.) The film's opening text informs the audience that we're in a world where “metahumans” have existed on Earth for 300 years, which makes Superman just one of many powered-people on the hero scene. That's good news for those who have longed to see Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), and Guy Gardner's Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion) on the big screen; less so for those who just want a fresh, clean take on The Last Son Of Krypton. 

Gunn clearly wants his new DC Universe to feel like stepping into a comic book, which it very much does. Only, it's more like the middle issue of a massive crossover event than a true entry point. In fact, with so many metahumans running around, Superman sometimes feels more like an X-Men movie with an amped-up role for Cyclops. There are outlines of a unique hero's journey here: Superman debates geopolitics with Lois! He gets canceled online! He grapples with his heritage! He makes terrible strategic decisions! He literally fights a cloned version of himself! Yet none of those ideas are strung together in a particularly meaningful or insightful way because the movie keeps getting distracted by interdimensional portals and wacky side players instead of the emotional arc of its leading man. 

The impulse to pile on comedic characters and sketch them out just enough served Gunn well in ensemble romps like The Suicide Squad and his Guardians Of The Galaxy trilogy, but it winds up hurting him here. To squeeze in as many DC characters as possible, Nicholas Hoult's power-hungry Lex Luthor gets two superpowered henchmen, two vapid girlfriends (both end up incarcerated), an army of robots, a team of both human and monkey hackers, a sky-high command center, a secret pocket dimension prison, a kaiju deployment team, and an Eastern European political ally. But what he doesn't have is a scene that establishes or explores his motivation beyond a simple, spoken aloud obsession with taking down Superman because he's jealous of him. (Hoult tries his best to add some emotional layers, but in a world filled with metahumans, Lex's personal grudge doesn't land as strongly.) 

Though you'd think skipping the classic Superman origin story would leave the film and its hero with more room to breathe, Gunn fills the extra screentime with more DC world-building instead—like the aforementioned “Justice Gang” trio and their under-explained assortment of powers. (Hopefully you already know what a Green Lantern ring does.) In fact, there's really only one scene in the whole movie that takes the time to just let its leads meaningfully interact with each other, and that's when Clark agrees to let Lois interview him “on the record” as Superman.

There are some promising ideas at play in the charged exchange that follows. Clark is an earnest do-gooder—he stepped in to stop a brutal invasion in a foreign country—but also woefully naïve when it comes to how that action might be perceived politically. (No wonder he has to keep interviewing himself to keep his journalism job.) The more jaded, cynical Lois is worried that her boyfriend's almost childlike sense of optimism might make them fundamentally incompatible as a couple. But once the movie introduces that dilemma, it doesn't circle back around to resolve it. Though the scene would seem to set up Lois and Clark's relationship as the heart of the film, in the end she's got less to do than Superman's dog Krypto. 

Instead of dealing with questions of interventionism, Clark gets pulled into a sideplot involving a shapeshifting dad named Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) and his kidnapped CGI baby. Instead of grappling with the dynamics of her new relationship, Lois winds up briefly teaming up with the Justice Gang before being sidelined with a Daily Planet supporting crew that includes Perry White (Wendell Pierce), Steve Lombard (Beck Bennett), and Cat Grant (Mikaela Hoover). They're characters who each get about a line of dialogue before Lois has to inexplicably fly them all around in a shuttle. And for some reason, Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) is the one who does all the actual reporting for her big story. 

Comedically, the film does gain something by dropping us right into the comic book deep end. It's funny to watch Clark exasperatedly worry about his dog while the Justice Gang fights a giant monster outside his window. And there's a cocky confidence to having a drunken Supergirl (Milly Alcock) randomly drop in ahead of her own movie debuting next summer. But the goofy nonchalant world-building also robs this story of a bit of its humanity, which is ironic when humanity winds up being so central to the film's climax. 

Like Man Of Steel before it, Superman is ultimately a movie about Clark's heritage and how it shapes his heroism. Where Cavill's Supes saw himself as an alien living among men, this Superman's arc is about learning to see himself as a human who just happens to have an alien origin story. It's a clever pivot from the last DCEU set-up, although—like so many elements of this overstuffed story—the emotional details are a bit glossed over. 

Gunn delivers an impressively bold twist to comics canon with the reveal that Clark's Kryptonian parents (Bradley Cooper and Angela Sarafyan) sent him to Earth with the intention of conquering and ruling it. That's when Clark realizes that his real parents are the humans who raised him to be a good person, not the biological parents he only knows via hologram. Yet despite their ultimate importance, Gunn introduces Ma and Pa Kent (Neva Howell and Pruitt Taylor Vince) as sitcom-y Southern hicks who pop in for a quick phone call and then disappear for the first two acts of the movie. (They must have gotten their accents from the Alabama side of Kansas.)

Pa Kent eventually gets to deliver a big inspirational speech to send Clark into the movie's climax, but why not make his dynamic with his son more central before that? Why not explore the origins of Superman's wholesome optimism rather than just relying on Corenswet's charm to sell it? Why spend more time mocking bumbling blonde Eve Teschmacher (Sara Sampaio) than getting to know Clark outside of his supersuit? A finale in which a superhero literally has to fight another version of himself is the sort of thing that should have some thematic resonance (and it did, back in Superman III). Here it feels like just one more wacky comic book plot twist. 

In some ways, Gunn's sunnier Superman is a change of pace from what the DCEU offered before, but in others it's just more of the same. (Not to mention a lesser version of The CW's similarly optimistic take on the character played by Tyler Hoechlin in Supergirl and Superman & Lois.) Gunn's goal may not be to literally introduce supporting characters in order to give them solo properties later, like the infamous Batman V Superman. But the result of prioritizing universe-building over character-focused storytelling is the same. Superman successfully launches a new tone and ethos for DC. It just doesn't launch Superman.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cult Of Criterion: Barry Lyndon","https://www.avclub.com/cult-of-criterion-barry-lyndon","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

In Cult Of Criterion, The A.V. Club highlights a new release from The Criterion Collection each month, examining the films entering an increasingly accessible film canon.

After directing three incisively modern Best Picture nominees in a row, Stanley Kubrick made a period piece, one as suffused with the emotional tenor of its era as Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or A Clockwork Orange. Celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration from Criterion, Kubrick's 1975 William Makepeace Thackeray adaptation Barry Lyndon was also nominated for Best Picture—in one of the strongest crops the Academy has ever honored—and its baroque, candlelit majesty isn't as different from its peers as it may initially seem.

Up against Dog Day Afternoon, Jaws, Nashville, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest—films all deserving of the half-century celebrations they'll receive this year, and films all explicitly critical of their country—a picaresque set during the Seven Years' War doesn't seem nearly as relevant to the contemporary cultural climate. But in this emotionally suppressed, lavishly shot look at a cold-blooded striver's epic rise and fall, Barry Lyndon finds an eternal rot under the powdered wigs and painted-on beauty spots. In fact, the incredible attention to detail, something highlighted not just by the stunning restoration but by two included booklet interviews reprinted from American Cinematographer, makes the film's lipstick-on-a-pig ironies all the more apparent.

At the heart of this is Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), an Irish softboi whose 18th-century opportunism embodies the conflicts of both the “Me” Decade that his film was made in the middle of, and the ruthless “greed is good” '80s that America was barreling towards. And yet, the historical elements are never compromised, the fastidiousness of Kubrick serving to effectively button up his characters' familiarly covetous desires, lustful glances, and cruel cold-shoulders under layers of velvet and shadow. 

But this is just a costume, not a disguise. From the film's opening moments—Barry's father, killed in a duel over something stupid; Barry, confronted by his cousin's heaving breasts, blows up his life over them—Barry Lyndon establishes itself as a film whose archaic social codes are as transparent as they are opulently realized. There is a reason that the mashup between the film and 21 Savage's “A Lot” works so well: Bad decisions driven by base impulses aren't going away. They're baked into the human condition.

As the film goes on, as Barry attempts to bend the world to his ballsy yet slow-witted will, Kubrick's script dries out the novel's humor. Where Thackeray used the first-person, allowing Barry to tell his own unreliable tale and trusting his readers to poke holes in the windbag, Kubrick adds a godlike narrator (Michael Hordern), whose omniscient observations undercut both Barry's airs and, at times, whatever suspense the film might have. It's a choice that could be seen as holding the viewers' hand, escorting them step-by-step through the gaudy affectations. But, compared to directly juxtaposing Barry's actions with his perception of his actions (which the audience gets a taste of in his self-aggrandizing bedtime story about his war heroics), this narration is more subtle, more grounded, more sly. It's more ironic than gut-busting, more off-handed than farcical. It's critical of the mythmaking while still maintaining the aesthetic of the myth.

The atmosphere of the entire film reflects this restraint. The definitive camera move of Barry Lyndon, a slow backwards zoom expanding a close-up of a character into a tableau contextualizing their smallness, is both evocative of the time period's fine art and cuttingly contemplative of our individual place in the grand scheme of things. All the innovations that went into John Alcott's Oscar-winning cinematography (which utilized lenses originally developed for NASA to use in the Moon landing, something that ended up influencing the rumor that the event was a Kubrick-filmed hoax) served a purpose beyond pure beauty. It reflected not only the setting, but how those living in it saw themselves in art: dignified, noble, composed. Creating the perfect veneer meant that it was all the more powerful when it fell away.

During conversations between characters, it can seem as if they're holding their breath in a battle of wills, waiting for the other to burst first. And when they do finally pop, recognizable humanity spills forth in a messy flood of violence. The suppressed, bottled-up emotions—never as opaque as its ladies and lordlings might hope—explode just like they do in so many of this film's peers. These climactic collisions, almost always resulting in death or dismemberment or social suicide, surface all the things people were far too polite to mention in the the 1770s…or, say, the 1950s. Barry's rampant cheating, his foolishness with money, his gold-digging, his pridefully quick temper—-these are translated through the idiom of the era, but are no less jagged and human than the other shaggy-dog stories of imperfect men bumbling into and out of theaters at the time.

As a filmmaker who worked in nearly every genre imaginable, Kubrick's career trajectory always seemed surprising. But Barry Lyndon, like so many of his other eyebrow-raising pivots (Kubrick's next film? The crowd-pleasing Stephen King adaptation The Shining), was less a departure from his interests and his environment than it appeared at first blush. It still presented a somewhat bleak view of humanity, translated through people whose deeper feelings were encased inside stubborn customs, with a bitter sense of humor, presented through images that served its message and its setting. Don't let the engrossing singularity of its candelabra flames fool you. Barry Lyndon is as of its time as it is timeless.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Elmo and Donald Trump have some explaining to do on a new Daily Show","https://www.avclub.com/daily-show-jon-stewart-elmo-epstein-client-list","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 05:18:00 GMT","

As is typically the case on Mondays, there is a lot of news—way more than can fit into a single Daily Show. For instance, earlier today, the Supreme Court decided to uphold President Trump's order to lay off 1,400 employees of the Department of Education, clearing the way for Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the Department. Meanwhile, less than a week after Grok's big antisemitic tear, Elon Musk's xAI company, the makers of his so-called MechaHitler, scored a $200 million contract with the Department of Defence. They're also making AI girlfriends for people to descend into AI psychosis with. Ka-ching. Pumps fist. Cries in mirror. If that wasn't bad enough, as The A.V. Club covered earlier today, Sesame Street resident Elmo went rogue yesterday, as hackers took over Elmo's X account and began posting about, you guessed it, the Epstein client list and the Jews.

Jon Stewart hosted Elmo on tonight's show, which was initially supposed to be about the tariffs. Remember those? Trump added a 17% tax to Mexican tomatoes today. But instead, Stewart did an extended riff about Elmo getting radicalized by the manosphere because he is a victim of the Male Loneliness Epidemic. The truth does, in fact, hurt.



But the crux of the show focused on the fissure in MAGA world regarding the closing of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The release of the Epstein Client list is a big deal in Trump's world, with many of the workers within his cottage industry of conspiracy theories believing it to be the linchpin toward taking down that secret cabal of pedophiles they're obsessed with. MAGA luminaries like Glenn Beck, Jesse Watters, and Lauren Ingraham have already publicly criticized the administration for its sudden about-face on the subject. So Trump decided to post through it, asking his “boys” and, in some cases, his “gals” to go back to worrying about other conspiracy theories, like Hunter Biden's laptop. It didn't work, and as such, his movement is in revolt for the time being. Basking in schadenfreude, Stewart delighted in telling America's red states that his new pronouns are “how does” and “my ass taste?”

“The Trump that you're just experiencing now, to your deep disappointment and dismay, is the dude we've been dealing with the whole fucking time,” Stewart says in tonight's show. “You just didn't realize it because he's been nice to you.”

“Whatever you need, Daddy's here because you're the child he wanted, but we're Eric.” Again, the truth hurts.

Reese Witherspoon is soaking up the sun — and the romance — on a luxury yacht in the South of France. The 49-year-old actress was seen packing on the PDA with new boyfriend Oliver Haarmann, 57, off the coast of Saint-Tropez on July 13.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

The sultry snaps show Witherspoon and the private-equity financier embracing and kissing while enjoying the sea breeze and summer weather. The actress wore an all-white swimsuit, while Haarmann kept it casual in a striped bathing suit, blue t-shirt, and a white Nike baseball cap.

The couple's relationship first made headlines in September 2024, when multiple sources confirmed to People that Witherspoon and Haarmann had been dating. The pair were initially spotted in New York City that July. At the time, a source said the actress was “taking things slow when it comes to dating.”

“She enjoys it but doesn't want it to be a big focus. She's busy with work and her son,” the source added. “These are her biggest priorities.”

A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon)

In October 2024, another insider shared that the two were continuing to see each other. “She's having fun with Oliver,” the source said, adding that Witherspoon “often flies between Nashville and N.Y.C. to see him.”

Haarmann, a founding partner of Searchlight Capital and minority co-owner of the NHL's New York Islanders, has also reportedly spent time with Witherspoon's children, including her sons Deacon Phillippe, 21, and Tennessee James Toth, 12.

“It's unclear if he's met her daughter Ava Phillippe yet,” the source said at the time, but noted, “Reese loves that he's a businessman and not into Hollywood.”

A post shared by Entertainment Tonight (@entertainmenttonight)

Reese Witherspoon was previously married twice. She met her first husband, actor Ryan Phillippe, at her 21st birthday party, per People. The pair went on to star together in the hit 1999 film “Cruel Intentions” and married that same year. They welcomed their daughter, Ava, shortly after and had a son, Deacon, in 2003. The couple separated in 2006.

In 2011, the “Big Little Lies” star married CAA talent agent Jim Toth. The couple welcomed their son, Tennessee James, in 2012. In March 2023, Witherspoon and Toth announced their decision to divorce in a joint statement shared to Instagram.

“We have some personal news to share… It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the statement read. “We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness and mutual respect for everything we have created together.”

With her romantic life heating up, Witherspoon continues to balance her personal world with a busy professional schedule. Most recently, she starred in the 2025 comedy “You're Cordially Invited” alongside Will Ferrell. She's also set to return this fall in season 4 of “The Morning Show” and is producing the long-anticipated “Legally Blonde 3,” which remains in pre-production.

Jessica Alba is stepping into a new chapter. The actress stepped out in Cancun with a new companion just months after announcing her split from longtime husband Cash Warren. The new mystery man has been revealed to be actor Danny Ramirez, best known for his role in “Captain America.”

As per photos published by TMZ, the pair were photographed boarding a flight back to Los Angeles together after spending time in the Mexican resort city. Alba, 44, and Ramirez, 32, landed in L.A. just after 5 p.m. on Sunday. Their return sparked immediate buzz, with fans curious about the nature of their relationship. The actress is currently in the midst of a divorce.

A post shared by Jessica Alba (@jessicaalba)

In February, Alba officially filed for divorce from her husband, Cash Warren, after 20 years together. According to TMZ, the insiders claimed the split was “extremely amicable,” with both parties requesting joint custody of their three children: Honor, 17, Haven, 13, and Hayes, 7. Despite the separation, Alba and Warren have continued to show mutual respect.

On Father's Day, Alba took to social media to celebrate her estranged husband with a heartfelt message. Over a throwback photo from 2017 of Warren holding their son Hayes, she shared kind words reflecting their shared parenting journey.

A post shared by Jessica Alba (@jessicaalba)

“We are moving forward with love, kindness and respect for each other and will forever be family,” she wrote. “Our children remain our highest priority and we request privacy at this time.”

The tribute came months after Alba announced their separation in January, when she posted an emotional message about their decision to part ways:

“I've been on a journey of self-realization and transformation for years,” she wrote. “I'm proud of how we've grown in our marriage over the last 20 years and it's now time for us to embark on a new chapter of growth and evolution as individuals.”

While Alba has not publicly addressed her connection with Ramirez, the sighting has stirred interest in what's next for the actress.

Late on July 12th, fans of Jeff Lynne's Electric Light Orchestra were devastated to learn that the iconic musician was canceling what was to be his very final show at the BST Hyde Park festival. Lynne's management reported that he was suffering from an infection that had spread throughout his body. 

“Jeff Lynne is heartbroken to report that he will not be able to perform at tomorrow's BST Hyde Park show,” BST Hyde Park's Instagram page read. “Jeff has been battling a systemic infection and is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule.” 

A post shared by BST Hyde Park (@bsthydepark)

Unfortunately for fans hoping to see Steve Winwood, the Doobie Brothers, or the other acts scheduled to perform on July 13th, it didn't happen. BST decided to cancel the entire last day after Lynne announced that he would be unable to attend.

ELO also pulled out of their second-to-last performance at Manchester's Co-Op Live on July 10, minutes before showtime. After that, fans began to worry that the last show was also in jeopardy. A fan who had attended their show on July 9th reported that Lynne wasn't doing so well.

“Well I have just come out from the ELO concert and what can I say. Jeff Lynne had to be helped onto the stage…..he was missing his cues, forgetting words and almost collapsed two thirds of the way through the concert,” Andy Linehan wrote on Facebook. “They had to bring him a chair and he was struggling to stay on it. By the end of the concert the band had to sing Mr Blue Sky for him and his backing singers looked visibly shaken up. At the concert end the crew rushed onto the stage to help him off.”

Lynne first announced the BST Hyde Park Final Show in October 2024. He was excited because it was a full-circle moment for him.

“My return to touring began at Hyde Park in 2014”, Jeff Lynne wrote on Instagram. “It seems like the perfect place to do our final show. We couldn't be more excited to share this special night in London with our UK fans. As the song goes, ‘we're gonna do it One More Time!'” 

A post shared by Jeff Lynne's ELO (@jefflynneselo)

Leading up to the final show of the Electric Light Orchestra's 55-year career, Lynne had already suffered another setback, which he explained to the crowd at his show in Birmingham.

“I was riding in a taxi in London, who slammed on its brakes to avoid an accident, and I broke my hand,” he told the crowd. “That's why I can't play guitar tonight.”

“But nothing could keep me away from you tonight,” he added.

On July 14th, Lynne posted an Instagram story with the caption, “Today at the Rose Garden in Hyde Park,” and featured a crowd of people singing ELO's hit song, “Mr. Blue Sky.” “Thank you,” he wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","John Goodman's Shocking 200-Pound Weight Loss Transformation Stuns Fans","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/john-goodmans-200-pound-weight-loss/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 16:28:55 GMT","

John Goodman turned heads at the “Smurfs” premiere with his incredible transformation, showcasing the results of his life-changing 200-pound weight loss journey.

The 73-year-old actor stepped onto the red carpet at Paramount Pictures Studios in Los Angeles on Sunday, July 13, looking healthier and happier than ever in a sharp navy blue suit, brown loafers, and patterned tie. Goodman's appearance at the event showed the amazing physical change he's achieved through years of hard work and lifestyle changes.

At his heaviest, Goodman weighed 392 pounds before beginning his fitness journey in 2007. His commitment to health and wellness has been a gradual process, involving multiple elements including dietary changes, regular exercise, and sobriety.

The beloved actor voices Papa Smurf in the upcoming animated musical film, which features an impressive cast including Rihanna, James Corden, Nick Offerman, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, and Hannah Waddingham. The movie hits theaters on July 18, marking another big moment in Goodman's continued acting career alongside his personal health success.

Goodman's weight loss strategy involved working closely with personal trainer Mackie Shilstone, who helped him develop a comprehensive approach to health and fitness. The program focused on sustainable changes rather than temporary solutions, according to Men's Health.

The Mediterranean diet played a central role in Goodman's nutritional transformation. This eating plan emphasizes fish, nuts, olive oil, vegetables, and fruit while reducing processed foods and sugar intake. The actor had previously told People that cutting sugar from his diet helped him drop 100 pounds, demonstrating the impact of targeted dietary modifications.

“It takes a lot of creative energy to sit on your ass and figure out what you're going to eat next,” Goodman shared with the outlet in 2010. “I wanted to live life better.”

His exercise routine became equally important to his success. Goodman committed to working out six days a week, taking 10,000 to 12,000 steps daily and using equipment like elliptical bikes and treadmills. This consistent physical activity helped build the foundation for his long-term weight management.

Addressing his relationship with food, Goodman told ABC in 2016: “I'd have a handful of food and it'd go to my mouth. I was just eating all the time. I was just eating alcoholically.”

One of the most significant aspects of Goodman's transformation involved changing his approach to weight loss itself. He recognized that his previous attempts at rapid weight loss were unsustainable and often led to regaining the weight.

“In the old days, I would take three months out, lose 60 or 70 pounds, and then reward myself with a 6-pack of Bud or whatever and just go back to my old habits,” Goodman explained to ABC. “Then this time I wanted to do it slowly, move, exercise. I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore. And it gives me the energy to work, 'cause work is very draining.”

Eliminating alcohol became a crucial component of his lifestyle overhaul. Goodman's decision to pursue sobriety alongside his weight loss efforts addressed multiple health concerns simultaneously and contributed to his overall well-being transformation.

The actor's approach to portion control also evolved significantly. In 2018, he told AARP: “It was basically just portion control and ‘I don't need it.' I was just shoving everything into my mouth.” 

His mindset shift extended beyond just eating habits to encompass his entire relationship with health and wellness. Goodman told Howard Stern in 2016: “I took it slow. I just wanted to change my lifestyle. It's an ongoing process for the rest of my life.”

The actor continues to maintain his healthier lifestyle while pursuing his acting career, recently wrapping up his role as Dan Conner on “The Conners” after the show's seven-season run ended in April 2025.

“My Big Fat Fabulous Life” star Whitney Way Thore had to say goodbye to her cat Henchi of 17 years. While the pet passed away earlier in the year, the moment will be shown in the Tuesday, July 15 episode, according to Parade.

Thore hosted a touching memorial service for her animal and mentioned Henchi's love of all things plastic.

“Henchi would love you if you were plastic,” she said in the clip. “Now, one by one, come to the offering plate and deposit your own, unique piece of plastic for Henchi to play with in the ether forevermore.”

Family members came up one by one to give a few words on the late kitty. Thore's father, Glenn, remembered when Henchi first came into their lives and said he “maybe became the most favorite cat we had ever had.” He brought bubble wrap as it was a favorite of his.

Thore held up a photo of when Henchi was just a little kitten, as her dad remembered him. Her brother also spoke about the cat.

“Henchi was orange and he always looked mad even when he was happy,” he said. “Here is a deli container for the afterlife.”

During the service, the group meowed “Amazing Grace” in honor of the pet.

Thorne detailed her final moments with her cat in a heartfelt Instagram post on January 21, 2025.

“RIP sweet Henchimayne. 10.01.2007—01.21.2025. I came home today after three weeks away and spent just a few hours with my sweetest boy when he suddenly became ill,” she began.

She added, “He died in my arms an hour ago. He was the most faithful companion to me for the last 17 years and every day I was so overcome with love and affection for him as if it were the first day I ever knew him.”

The TLC star also added a series of images with Henchi throughout the years.

“From the day I got him from a little pet shop in Korea he has brought me nothing but so much joy. I love you, Henchi,” she concluded.

While Thore morned the loss of Henchi, she has since welcomed a new kitten into her life.

She shared with fans on May 8 that she just adopted a Persian kitten.

“Thore, Machete 🔪 Sex: Male D.O.B.: 02.08.2025,” she wrote in the Instagram post.

A post shared by Whitney Way Thore⚡️ (@whitneywaythore)

She listed the date of adoption as May 3, 2025.

 “Proclivities: to be determined,” she added. The video showed the little orange fluffball looking sleepy as Thore made his paws dance.

Kim Kardashian's stepbrother Brody Jenner got married on July 12, 2025. The 41-year-old son of Caitlyn Jenner wed 28-year-old professional surfer Tia Blanco in a lowkey ceremony which took place at the home of his mother, Linda Thompson, per E! News. Thompson is Caitlyn Jenner's second wife, and was married to the gold medalist from 1981 to 1986. The exes share their 44-year-old son Brandon along with Brody.

A post shared by BROSA (@brodyjenner)

Blanco is Brody's first legally official wife, but he previously shared an aesthetically stunning June 2018 wedding ceremony with ex Kaitlynn Carter, which was documented in stunning photography by Mitch Pohl. As you know, Carter later went on to famously date Miley Cyrus from August to September 2019.

People says Brody's famous father did not attend his son's first wedding, and the socialite reacted at the time by saying, “Not having my dad at the wedding, it was a bummer. Honestly, it really did hurt and I would have loved to have had her there.” This time around, the outlet says the gold medalist was present to help Brody celebrate his big day. 

However, one person close to him was notably absent – his longtime friend Spencer Pratt. But there doesn't look to be any bad blood between the pals that led to “The Hills” star missing out on the event. Read on to learn the totally understandable reason Pratt wasn't there.

It turns out Pratt missed his friend's wedding because he had a different ceremony to attend the same day. The father of two took to TikTok to reply to a fan who questioned him, “Why weren't you at Brody's wedding!?” with a simple answer. “Holly had her wedding at the same time,” he wrote, referring to Heidi Montag's sister. 

The 41-year-old, who married his “The Hills” costar Heidi Montag in 2008, accompanied the post with an adorable shot of himself and his two sons all dressed up. Pratt wore a light tan suit while the boys, who Us Weekly says are 7 and 2, sported pastel green vests with matching shorts. As a choice of background music, he used the song “Counting My Blessings” by Seph Schlueter.

One fan reacted to the news by saying, “Awww gotta have a Brody wedding part 2 so you can be there.”

Some fans questioned why Brody chose to attend the wedding even after his prior drama with Holly on “The Hills,” but one pointed out, “Spencer always supports Heidi. Of course he would be at Holly's wedding. They made up years ago.”

A third fan showed support for Spencer's actions, saying, “He did the right thing choosing to attend the one his wife needed to go to. Love this. That was a tough one.”

Pratt's wife shared several cute clips from the wedding trip, including one of the family crowding together for a photo. She joked in the caption, “How many adults does it take to get a photo with kids?”

How many adults does it take to get a photo with kids? ..

So how does Spencer Pratt know Brody Jenner? The pair actually goes way back, according to The Things, which says they are childhood friends. It was that friendship that got Brody onto “The Hills” in a “friend of” role. He first appeared on the show in season 2, which aired the same year “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” came out. Brody continued to make appearances through the show's six seasons, 

As of 2025, Pratt and Brody's friendship appears to still be going strong. In January, Brody told E! News, “I talk to Spencer almost every day.”

Cannes 2025 festival-goers put their stamp of approval of Harris Dickinson the filmmaker, with his directing debut “Urchin” winning the FIPRESCI prize out of Un Certain Regard. What can't the “Babygirl” and “Triangle of Sadness” and “Beach Rats” and “The Iron Claw” actor and future John Lennon star do? 

A favorite of IndieWire's Screen Talk podcast and Chief Film Critic David Ehrlich, “Urchin” seemed primed for a major scoop out of Cannes alongside other actor-turned-filmmakers (Kristen Stewart's “Chronology of Water,” still without a buyer, and Scarlett Johansson's “Eleanor the Great,” set up at Sony Pictures Classics and, we're guessing, next poised for a TIFF bow).

Alas, it took two months since the festival's end for rising distribution outfit 1-2 Special to step in and buy Dickinson's film for North American distribution. Starring Frank Dillane as an unhoused, drug-chasing drifter in London, and in the vein of Mike Leigh's “Naked” in terms of toxic emotional candor, “Urchin” follows Mike (Dillane) as he tumbles through a cycle of addiction, self-destruction, and London's correctional system. In addition to the FIPRESCI prize, Dillane also won a Best Performance award out of Un Certain Regard. (IndieWire's Anne Thompson even deemed Dillane a potential Oscar contender.)

Per a release on July 15, 1-2 Special will release “Urchin” in theaters this fall. Expect to play the gamut of fall festivals as word-of-mouth builds, and Dickinson's viral star keeps rising (especially since “Babygirl”).

Producer Archie Pearch said, “We're incredibly excited to have 1-2 Special on board as our North American distributor. Their bold, distinctive slate and deep passion for the film make them the ideal partner to help us connect with audiences across North America. As a new company ourselves, we recognized a kindred spirit in their entrepreneurial passion.”

Launched this past February ahead of the Berlinale by Sideshow co-founding executive Jason Hellerstein, 1-2 Special has launched with a suite of intriguing buys this year. The distributor is firmly in the Radu Jude business, with North American rights to the Romanian director's Silver Bear winner “Kontinental 25” and upcoming Locarno premiere “Dracula.” There's also Christian Petzold's “Miroirs No. 3,” bought for the U.S. from Metrograph Pictures, and Simón Mesa Soto's Un Certain Regard Jury Prize winner “A Poet” coming up.

“Urchin” was produced by Archie Pearch at Devisio Pictures, with Scott O'Donnell of Somesuch. The film was developed by BBC Film and financed by BBC Film, BFI, and Tricky Knot. Executive Producers are Eva Yates, Ama Ampadu, Alexandra Tynion, and Olivia Tyson.

 










The deal was negotiated by The Gersh Agency, UTA Independent Film Group, and Charades on behalf of the filmmakers with 1-2 Special.

Just when you thought awards season was over, it's time for the Emmys. Nominations for TV's highest honor were announced Tuesday morning, sparking a race that's been heating up for months. Only one of last year's nominees for Best Drama Series remains eligible in 2025, which makes securing a nod (and snagging the trophy) that much more valuable. (Breaking through at the Emmys is critical for shows eyeing to return, season after season.) The Best Comedy Series race is a toss-up, with last year's surprise victor “Hacks” going toe-to-toe with the one-time favorite, “The Bear,” and strong newcomers like “The Studio.” As for Best Limited Series, “Adolescence” seems primed to rack up trophies, but the race can change at any time and being recognized really is an honor unto itself.

With 600 programs submitted in the Best Series categories — only 14 fewer than last year — there is still far too much TV for any voter to watch in the time allotted, which means… there will be snubs. Yes, it's time to talk about the snubs and surprises of 2025, but before we get into it, please remember:

Here at IndieWire, a “snub” is just industry shorthand for a series or individual who was expected to be nominated, thought to be deserving of a nomination, or both, and yet — for whatever reason — they did not receive recognition for their work. (Not today, anyway — there's always the fall awards!) Labeling any such program or person a “snub” does not convey intent; it does't mean their peers had it out for them, or voters purposefully shunned one potential nominee in favor of another.

On the other end of the spectrum, anything dubbed a “surprise” is a series or individual who was thought to be out of the running before nominations were announced; something or someone who was written off too early, whether it was because they didn't mount much of a campaign, didn't match up well in their category, or simply didn't get the typical plaudits heaped upon your standard Emmy nominee.

By and large, it's best if you remember, dear readers, that the very nature of competition means not everyone can win (or, in this case, be nominated), and it's only human for those invested in television to react with shock and awe, admiration and anger, to the TV Academy's picks for the season's best shows.

So, without further ado, let's dig in:

(OK, there's just one more little bit of to-do: Voting for the 2025 Emmy winners will begin August 18 and end August 27 at 10 p.m. PT. The 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set for Sunday, September 14 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.)

With additional reporting by Proma Khosla.

Many prognosticators feared the lead of “Andor” would get boxed out of the heated race for Best Actor in a Drama Series, and indeed he did. Sterling K. Brown (“Paradise”) proved his enduring appeal to the TV Academy, as did Pedro Pascal (despite appearing in less than half of “The Last of Us” Season 2). Gary Oldman (“Slow Horses”), Noah Wyle (“The Pitt”), and Adam Scott (“Severance”) rounded out the category, leaving Luna on the outside looking in.

Actors in blockbuster entertainment (like a “Star Wars” show) have long struggled to gain traction with awards voters, although Brown and Scott's inclusion tarnishes any theories about bias against science-fiction. Odds are the competition was simply too stiff in Luna's category and one favorite had to lose out. (That doesn't explain why Forest Whitaker is the lone “Andor” acting nominee — well-deserved! — so perhaps there's “Star Wars” fatigue within the Academy?)

Zero nominations? None? The first season of “Squid Game” won six Emmys out of 14 nominations, but Season 2 — the only season eligible for the 2025 Emmys — was summarily blanked. Either voters soured on the narrative's repetitive nature, were frustrated by its cliffhanger ending, or simply preferred this year's other dramas! Technically, “Squid Game” Season 3 can compete in next year's Emmys… but it's hard to imagine a return to form after this complete shutout. 

We were preparing to mourn yet another year of snubs for Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen's excellent HBO comedy, but then the TV gods blessed us with two whole nominations! OK, sure, “Somebody Somewhere” — the best series of 2024 — deserves more than single digit nods, but considering one is for Best Writing (honoring both creators and star Bridget Everett) and the other is for breakout supporting star Jeff Hiller, it's hard to complain. You just know Sam and Joel would be giddy right now, already on their way downtown to celebrate over donuts and karaoke. 

Alfonso Cuaron's cunning Apple TV+ series was widely expected to perform well in a down year for limited series, but it could only muster two total nominations: Cate Blanchett (of course) for Best Actress in a Limited Series, and Emmanuel Lubezki and Bruno Delbonnel for Best Cinematography in a Limited Series. 

Although these were clearly the show's most widely hailed elements, Kevin Kline was a surprise exclusion in Best Actor, and “Disclaimer” also got nudged out of Best Limited Series in favor of the latest season of “Black Mirror” (which now qualifies as an anthology). Be it recency bias or Netflix's wider reach, these losses have to sting for the pricey, ambitious adaptation. 

After “The Good Place's” slow start became a respectable run with the TV Academy — landing 12 nominations, including two for Best Comedy Series — as well as “Parks and Recreation's” late surge to 14 total nominations, it felt like Mike Schur's Netflix comedy “A Man on the Inside” was primed for a warm reception from the jump this time.

Instead, just like both of his previous hits, it was shut out. Ted Danson's exclusion stings a bit extra, but the entire series warrants awards attention. Maybe Season 2 can kickstart another Emmy comeback story.

Whatever thoughts you may have about Charlie Brooker's dystopic anthology — that it will never measure up to the early seasons, that it's too close to reality, that it should end — Season 7 was by most counts better than other recent installments, and “Common People” starring Rashida Jones and Chris O'Dowd felt more like early days “Black Mirror” than anything has for a while.

Jones plays a woman with a terminal brain tumor who adopts a new technology called Rivermind, which replaces her tumor with synthetic tissue powered by the company's servers — and financed by a monthly subscription fee that balloons over time as Rivermind swaps empathy for profit. As Amanda's health deteriorates in tandem with her family's financial status, Jones gives an aching performance with darkly comic flourishes, like when she becomes a human ad machine because of Rivermind's updated terms and conditions.

The rest of the season includes the psychological thriller “Bête Noire,” the Issa Rae-led “Hotel Reverie,” game simulation “Plaything,” emotional drama “Eulogy,” and the sequel “U.S.S. Callister: Into Infinity,” a solid successor to one of the series' most popular episodes ever. We might be living in “Black Mirror,” but we can still enjoy it sometimes. —PK

Look, John Mulaney's chaotic collection of comics, experts, actors, and bits might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it spoke to its own eclectic audience and experimented boldly with a weekly release schedule. Instead of Hollywood and headline news, “Everybody's Live” tackles the topics people are already discussing in real life, turning watercooler conversations and group chat debates into televised entertainment — not to mention the interstitial sketches, teen fight night, and pretty much every time Richard Kind pops up on screen. What's most baffling of all is this omission comes in a year where there are only three other nominees in the category. Maybe everybody isn't live, after all. —PK

Despite strong reviews and two nominations at the Gotham TV Awards, Mara Brock Akil's adaptation of Judy Blume's novel never seemed to get any traction. Did voters think it was a YA series, better fit for the Children's and Family Emmys? Did Netflix prioritize its other, higher-profile drama contenders, like “Squid Game,” “The Diplomat,” and “Bridgerton”? Did it need more star power to compete in a particularly starry Emmy field? We may never know, but anyone who saw “Forever” knows it deserved better than this.

Can the Emmys hand out an award for Outstanding Comedy Series in September if the year's best comedy isn't even nominated? I guess we'll find out, since Nathan Fielder's second season of “The Rehearsal” flew away without a nod for the top category.

That being said, “The Rehearsal” Season 2 did improve on Season 1 — landing four total nominations including two for Best Editing and two for Fielder (in Best Writing and Best Directing).

The TV Academy has long been baffled by Fielder, who previously was only nominated for directing Sacha Baron Cohen's 2018 Variety series “Who Is America” and producing John Wilson's “How To with John Wilson.” “The Rehearsal” landed zero nods for its first season, and “The Curse” was notoriously blanked just last year (despite Emma Stone's star power).

“The Rehearsal” Season 2 was considered a dark horse, but its three TCA nominations in July (including for Program of the Year), rave reviews, and wider reach (thanks mainly to Fielder's go-for-broke finale) may have helped it break through, even if they weren't enough to land the top target.

The first season of “Wolf Hall” earned eight Emmy nominations, including nods for Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis, as well as Best Limited Series. The second season of “Wolf Hall”… did not earn eight Emmy nominations. In fact, it earned one — for Best Period Costumes.

What happened? The short answer: Time. The longer answer: There were 10 years between Peter Straughan's debut season and his follow-up, and in that time, the awards race changed dramatically (along with the rest of television). PBS isn't at the top of voters' streaming queues, and historical dramas aren't in vogue (unless they're made by Shonda Rhimes or Julian Fellowes). Toss in the thousands of new voters who've joined the TV Academy in the last decade, and it spelled doom for a once-heralded series (even though “The Mirror and the Light” is absolutely fantastic).

OK, it's honestly a surprise that “Presumed Innocent” earned four nominations at all, given it wasn't nominated for Best Limited Series. That all four came for its cast, however, is less surprising and shows how limited the show's appeal was across the TV Academy's many branches. 

Still, most awards experts though Jake Gyllenhaal would lose out because the series debuted so long ago (last summer) and he couldn't do much campaigning while performing on Broadway in “Othello.” But his star power pushed him through, as it did for Peter Sarsgaard and Ruth Negga, two acclaimed turns from well-known actors (especially in awards circles).

So the biggest surprise has to be Bill Camp — and what a welcome surprise it is. Until today, the beloved character actor only had a single Emmy nomination to his name (in 2017 for “The Night Of”), but his collective body of work since then has earned more and more fans, as well as more and more attention from awards voters. (He was also on the ballot for “Sirens,” which would've been my pick for a nod, but we can always pretend this is for both.) 

Yes, “Andor” did well overall with 14 nominations (including Best Drama Series). But what about its ultimate (evil) power couple? Kyle Soller and Denise Gough were two of the hit “Star Wars” show's biggest breakouts. Their chemistry is palpable and unique. Their storylines are thorny and thrilling. Their exacting depictions of such appalling characters — especially whenever their well-buried humanity would sneak up to the surface — are simply outstanding, and seeing the Supporting Drama fields dominated by the same shows only makes excluding two clear standouts like these that much more frustrating.

After speaking to him a few months ago ahead of the Season 1 finale, I know that possibly no one loves “Paradise” more than executive producer and now lead actor nominee Sterling K. Brown. His nomination is less surprising than the show's overall, given the Television Academy's documented appreciation of Brown throughout “This Is Us” and even back when he broke out in “American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson.”

But “Paradise” nabbing a nom for Outstanding Drama Series might hint at a bigger shift in TV viewing along with HBO's “The Pitt”: that viewers crave the stakes and style of a weekly drama straight out of the network era, and that the episodic release model still has a spark. (Both of those shows, by the way? They're already working on Season 2 with plans to release within a year.) “Paradise” foregrounds social inequality and intrigue at the end of the world, anchored by strong performances from Brown and James Marsden (also nominated) in particular. While we did call this nomination, it's a pleasant surprise and worthy reward for a show that gripped its viewers, this one included. —PK

This year, the 12-time Oscar nominee saw his best chance at landing his first Emmy nomination by taking on the lead role in “The Righteous Gemstone's” Season 4 premiere — a departure episode that flashes back to the Civil War, when the Gemstone family's ancestor, Elijah, stirs up holy hell while posing as a preacher. One could argue Cooper's odds were better last year, when he popped up in “Abbott Elementary” as himself, but the limited screen time didn't offer the same impact as this, even if “Abbott” is far more beloved by the TV Academy than “Gemstones.” Maybe he should've found a way to “The White Lotus”?

To be clear, Uzo Aduba landing an Emmy nomination is almost never a surprise. The talented “Orange Is the New Black” breakout has won three Emmys — two for “OITNB” and one for “Mrs. America” — out of six total nominations (including this one). But despite her aforementioned series' success throughout the TV Academy, she's proven she doesn't need her show to be popular with Emmy voters to earn a slot all by herself. 

For her final nomination on “Orange Is the New Black,” she was one of two total nominations. For “In Treatment,” she was the show's only nomination that season, and now she's the only actor nominated from the bustling cast of “The Residence.” Sure, the Netflix mystery snagged four total nominations, but it did so after being canceled! Canceled! Not even getting abandoned by the world's leading streamer can keep Aduba from attending another Emmys. 

Widely seen as the sixth most-likely nominee in a category with only five slots, “Say Nothing” wasn't expected to make a ton of noise on Emmy morning, but FX's thrilling, complex, and well-acted drama certainly warranted some sort of ruckus — Lola Petticrew, especially. As Dolours Price, an IRA volunteer during the Troubles, Petticrew brings layers of intense conviction, cheeky confidence, and heartbreaking awareness to a soldier who's resolved to her fate, and gives all of herself anyway.

Her category was tough to crack, but she deserved to be in there. Instead, “Say Nothing” only earned one nomination: a much-deserved slot in Best Writing in a Limited Series or Movie. 

One of the best-reviewed new series of 2025, “Common Side Effects” snagged a coveted Best Animated Program slot. In recent years, voters have broadened their horizons, even if the Best Animated Program category remains in the grip of classics like “The Simpsons” and “Bob's Burgers.” Both of those shows were recognized, as well, but they couldn't stop Joseph Bennett and Steve Hely's buzzy comedy-thriller from breaking through.

When there's only two open slots and two of the contenders are “SNL” (the most awarded Emmy show of all-time with 101 trophies) and “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” (winner of 30 Emmys itself and a perennial victor in the ever-shifting Variety categories), then the other nominees aren't expecting an upset. Still, “Fantasmas” is a fantastic show — imaginative, hilarious, and designed as exquisitely as it is cast. (Where else can you find guest stars Emma Stone, Steve Buscemi, Natasha Lyonne, Paul Dano, Amy Sedaris, and Cole Escola all in one place?) Excluding it in favor of another stale “SNL” season only goes to show how little room the TV Academy makes for new programs, especially the ones that don't fit cleanly in one of the pre-existing categories. But hey, at least it snagged a nomination for Best Hairstyling in a Variety, Nonfiction, or Reality Program.

It might've been a long shot, but who can blame the Emmys for never wanting to leave the Meghann Fahy train? The “White Lotus” alum (and “The Bold Type” if you're a real one) soared in Molly Smith Metzler's limited series in which she plays a woman trying to retrieve her sister from the most deadly cult of all: wealth.

Fahy is one piece of a dynamite cast she represents with this nomination, continuing a streak of sublime performances that deserve recognition. She's in a stacked category with Cate Blanchett, Cristin Milioti, Michelle, Williams, and Rashida Jones, and she couldn't be more worthy. —PK

After a slight resurgence post-pandemic, “The Handmaid's Tale” went out with a whimper. Its final season netted only one nomination, and unlike its previous season, that solo nod wasn't for Elisabeth Moss. (This year, it went to Cherry Jones.) Voters may have drifted back to Gilead when there were fewer new shows to watch, but this performance doesn't bode well for Hulu's sequel series, “The Testaments.”

Some may want to lump “The Four Seasons” into the Snub category, given the fact that Tina Fey and Steve Carell's star power could only muster a single nomination… but a) Fey's latest Netflix creation never built any buzz, which makes it very hard to compete in a crowded comedy field, and b) that single nomination came for Colman Domingo, who's on an enviable and well-deserved awards streak. He's great in “The Four Seasons,” too, and I'll forever think he shares this nomination with his character's many outstanding hats.

Yes, Walton Goggins is doing just fine. Better than ever, you could say, after landing his second straight Emmy nomination (this year for “The White Lotus,” last year for “Fallout”) and third ever. (There was a 13-year gap after his lone nod for “Justified,” another role that certainly deserved greater recognition than the Emmys decided to provide.)

But anyone who's seen Danny McBride's outrageous HBO comedy, “The Righteous Gemstones,” knows Goggins created an all-time sitcom character in Uncle Baby Billy Freeman. Fully committed to the wayward preacher's sins and salvations, Goggins brings an enthralling bite to McBride's distinct vernacular and shapes his movements, posture, and overall presentation in such a specific manner, it's hard to believe Baby Billy isn't real. He's just a figment of the writers' imagination, brought to glorious life by the perfect performer.

That the TV Academy couldn't see fit to nominate him only proves one thing: The TV Academy didn't see him — not outside “The White Lotus,” anyway.

Prior to the Emmy nominations announcement, it was a widely accepted belief that “The Studio” — a TV show about making movies in Hollywood — would do very well. Hollywood stories tend to be popular among Hollywood voters, and “The Studio” benefitted from great reviews, a star-studded cast, and outrageous comedy. 

But did anyone see this coming? With 23 nominations, “The Studio” tied the record for the most nominations by a comedy series in a single season (with “The Bear's” 2024 showing) and broke the record for the most nominations by a freshman comedy series in a single season (shattering “Ted Lasso's” 20 nominations in 2021).  

Among its many recognitions, Martin Scorsese and Ron Howard earned their first acting Emmy nominations, as “The Studio” controlled five of the six Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series slots. (The only non-“Studio” nominee: Jon Bernthal for “The Bear.”)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Fred Armisen Announces New Album 100 Sound Effects","https://pitchfork.com/news/fred-armisen-announces-new-album-100-sound-effects/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 13:13:37 GMT","

Comedian, actor, and musician Fred Armisen has announced an album of sound effects. It's called 100 Sound Effects, and it actually features 101 sound effects. You'll be able to hear all of them when Drag City releases the album on September 26, but, for now, check out “Music Venues,” which collects seven sound effects.

The seven sound effects on “Music Venues” are: “Needle on Record,” “Drum Sound Check at Medium Sized Venue,” “Guitar Tuned but Still Somehow Out of Tune,” “Band Sound Check Sound Guy and Band Agreeing for Too Long,” “Romanian Crowd at Rock Club Shouting for an Encore,” “Sparsely Attended Show Encore With Someone Shouting ‘Where's Jim?',” and “Music Venue Employee Kicking Everyone Out While Throwing Away Bottles.”

According to a press release, “help and inspiration” on 100 Sound Effects came from Mary Lynn Rajskub, Amber Coffman, Tim Heidecker, Riki Lindhome, and Alice Carbone Tench. Additionally, Armisen is dedicating his album to the late Steve Albini.

“I was thinking about haunted house sound effects albums and how fun those seemed to record. I wanted to do it at Steve Albini's studio in Chicago, Electrical Audio, but since this wasn't a collection of songs and I didn't know how long it was going to take, I needed to do this where I live, in Los Angeles,” Armisen explained. “I told Steve what I was doing and asked if he knew of any engineers I could work with in L.A. He was very excited about the idea and asked Dave Grohl who might be available to help. Dave recommended Darrell Thorp, and we started working at Studio 606, and then later Sunset Sound. Darrell was really inventive and a lot of fun to work with. Because Steve was so instrumental in making this happen, I dedicate the album to his memory. I miss him every day.”

Armisen is going on a short tour in September called the Comedy for Musicians but Everyone Is Welcome Tour. He also some upcoming shows with John Mulaney (and fellow openers Mike Birbiglia and Nick Kroll) and a pair of events with his former Portlandia co-star, Carrie Brownstein.

These are heavy times and DJ Haram knows it. “This world betrayed me,” muses the Brooklyn-based artist near the top of Beside Myself, her long-gestating debut album: “Nah I'll never forgive this world for who it made me.” Two songs later, she spits with cold-hearted venom, “I see god and I can't stand him.”

The album's mood can be similarly severe. Beside Myself orbits around a hybrid of electronic sounds and Middle Eastern instrumentation that will be familiar to fans of Haram's 2019 EP Grace. But the results are far darker and more varied, a gangland knife fight to Grace's percussive tumble. “Lifelike” creeps by on ominous synth drone and piercing guitar feedback, the cramped mix offering no hope of reprieve, while “IDGAF” is a Vantablack amalgam of sludgy, metallic riffs, electronic claps, and darbuka drum patter, like a Syrian Black Sabbath. “Badass,” meanwhile, is a hard-edged playground chant—“Mama she a badass bitch/Mama don't take no shit/Mama gonna get that switch/Mama gonna beat that bitch”—set to nebulous, claustrophobic percussion.

Beside Myself frequently sounds angry. But this is not a one-note record or simple cry of outrage. On many songs, Haram—a DJ with years of experience—uses cleverly layered beats to add depth to the sharply pointed rage, bringing a release of anarchic energy to the album's furrowed brow. “Loneliness Epidemic” belies its somber title by lurching into motion like the first couple on a wedding dancefloor, ending up as a full-on Middle Eastern house banger. The electrifying “Sahel,” with Egyptian producer El Kontessa, is a breakbeat-versus-darbuka drum battle, rhythms slowing and accelerating at will, un-gridded and wild. And “Fishnets,” with Bbymutha, sha ray, and producer August Fanon, sets Saydah Ruz's haunting violin against the kind of dustily swaggering beat that the RZA used to reserve for peak Ghostface. Haram has called her album “the antithesis to ‘joy is resistance',” but it's hard not to feel a hit of jubilation when the beats hit this heavy and free.

As the album's cleverly ambiguous name suggests, Haram makes excellent use of her collaborators. Abdul Hakim Bilal's guitar playing is beautifully emotive, while Aquiles Navarro's trumpet adds a somber sense of ceremony to “Remaining.” On “Stenography,” Armand Hammer's Elucid and billy woods are by turns acrobatically surreal and poetically evocative, while Haram's 700 Bliss bandmate Moor Mother uses brutal repetition to brick a wall of words around the droning beat on “Lifelike.” But the album's best verse might be from Haram herself, on “Distress Tolerance,” where she intones, “Every man thinks his problems are the biggest/It's a funny coincidence /And I'm 'posed to be/Miss bubbly mistress.”

Playful but serious, clever but blunt, the verse speaks to the singular appeal of Haram's debut album: Beside Myself is as twisted as life itself, an audacious mixture of Jersey club, rap, punk, heavy guitars, live percussion, and classical elegance, where anger, joy, and frustration come mushed up in tangles like classroom Play-Doh. Some of the record is jaw-droppingly inventive, whether the violin gabber of “Voyeur” or the sun-warped jungle flex of “Sahel.” But it is a mark of Haram's vision that, through turbulence, she has created a musical universe where these anomalies can thrive. Beside Myself is dramatic and daring, the agreeably messy sound of the kind of radical freedom that might not change our sinking world but can liberate the willing mind.

Jonny Nash's Once Was Ours Forever is a sterling example of the Made of the Same Stuff album—as in, it doesn't sound exactly like his last album, but it's made of the same stuff. You know the type. They're not victory laps, diminishing returns, or B-grade leftovers so much as manifestations of how far an idea can go. They lack the element of surprise usually present in the prior album, instead showing off the artist's ability to inhabit a particular sound. And while these follow-ups are easy to underrate on the first few listens, they might end up becoming your favorites.

Nash is a Netherlands-based artist who's been enamored of woozy Robin Guthrie-style guitars since 2015's Exit Strategies. He really hit on a distinctive sound, however, with 2023's Point of Entry, a lovely ambient guitar album where every note seemed to melt off the neck of the guitar in thick, cheese-like gobs. It sounded like a suspension of moments in movies or cartoons where a character ingests a strange drug and their hands start going fish-eye in front of them. Once Was Ours Forever isn't much different, except in all the usual ways Made of the Same Stuff albums are: a bit more insular, more stripped-down, more confident and, inevitably, shorter.

The vibe is pastoral, bucolic, folky, a world of limestone crags jutting from emerald pastures. Nash has a little country studio outside of Amsterdam, and Once Was Ours Forever puts the listener in a vacation mindset. Music about the artist's experience of paradise sometimes reeks of certainty and the little death that comes with it, but there's a too-muchness to this music that keeps it exciting. Listen to the uncanny, lustrous filter he puts on his voice on “Blue Dragonfly” and “Bright Belief,” and you get the sense that the phrase “laying it on too thick” is a positive in Nash's process.

This time around, the record focuses on Nash's newly assured guitar playing. While on previous records he mostly let the tones talk, here he engages with the fretboard itself, spinning similar fingerpicked webs to those on Will Ackerman's empire-launching In Search of the Turtle's Navel while thick textural smears light up the depths of the mix. The featured guests are mostly here to be absorbed, including Japanese singer Satomimagae, who contributes dewy murmurs to “Rain Song,” and saxophonist Joseph Shabason, who was one-half of the horn section on Destroyer's louche-nouveau masterpiece Kaputt and seems most content when he's being used to give a swath of color rather than as a soloist.

I've played Point of Entry and Once Was Ours Forever together in a low ambient background hum to discern whether I could tell when one album had melted into the next. I didn't figure it out until halfway through Once Was Ours' second track, “Dusk Can Dance.” But the two albums leave a different impression when they're over: the first of the excitement of stumbling on a new sound, the second of witnessing intuitive mastery. And the best thing about Made of the Same Stuff albums is artists usually follow them with something completely different. Jonny Nash could do anything next.

David Kaff, who played keyboardist Viv Savage in Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, has died. His band Mutual of Alameda's Wild Kingdom shared the news to Facebook, writing “David always had a kind word and a quick wit that would slay you where you stand. Then he'd make you smile doing it!” A cause of death was not given, though the statement mentions that Kaff “passed away peacefully in his sleep” on Saturday, July 12. He was 79 years.

Born David Kaffinetti in 1946, Kaff got his start as a founding member of the British psychedelic rock band Rare Bird. The group was among the first to sign to Charisma Records, later the label home of Genesis and Peter Gabriel, and put out five studio albums between 1969 and 1974. Rare Bird's sole UK chart hit, 1970's “Sympathy,” features a prominent organ line courtesy of Kaff. In 1972, Kaff also went into the studio with Chuck Berry for The London Chuck Berry Sessions, which yielded the No. 1 single “My Ding-a-Ling.”

In This Is Spinal Tap, Kaff portrays the frizzy-haired keyboard player in fictional metal band Spinal Tap. Despite a smaller role relative to lead actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, Kaff's Viv Savage left his mark thanks to a combination of physical comedy (especially during the film's staged concert footage) and quotable one-liners. At one point, asked by McKean's David St. Hubbins if he's able to play Nigel Tufnel's (Guest) bassline on “Big Bottom,” Savage quips back, “I've got two hands, yeah I can do it.”

Kaff played on This Is Spinal Tap's accompanying soundtrack and, in May 1984, performed in character alongside his co-stars on Saturday Night Live. He left the group by the end of the year and did not return for the recording of their subsequent studio albums—1992's Break Like the Wind and 2009's Back from the Dead—but continued to play music with Oakland's Model Citizenz and, most recently, psych-rock outfit Mutual of Alameda's Wild Kingdom.

Kaff nonetheless maintained his fondness for Viv Savage over the years, telling BAM in 2011, “I played him very close to my heart… just a little bit dimmer. If people like that character, chances are they'll like me.” Kaff won't appear in Reiner's forthcoming Spinal Tap sequel, but forever holds the distinction of delivering the original film's final line: “Have a good time all the time—that's my philosophy, Marty.”

Philadelphia shoegaze band They Are Gutting a Body of Water have announced a lengthy tour and a new album. Lotto, their fourth studio LP, arrives October 17 (via Julia's War/Smoking Room/ATO). Bolstering the record is new single “Trainers,” which comes with a Ben Turok–directed video. Check it out below.

What began as the solo project of singer Doug Dulgarian has since been expanded into a proper four-piece, with bassist Emily Lofing, guitarist PJ Carroll, and drummer Ben Opatut joining the fold. Their new LP is billed as a step away from the digital collage work of 2022's Lucky Styles and the compilation Swanlike (Loosies 2020 - 2023), with Dulgarian instead putting the emphasis on his guitar again—as evidenced in “Trainers” and the previously released track “American Food.”

After releasing their new album, They Are Gutting a Body of Water head out on a lengthy North American tour. Beginning on October 30, in Cleveland, Ohio, they will make their way to major cities like Chicago, Denver, Vancouver, Los Angeles,Atlanta, Tornto, and more before ending the run on December 12 in their hometown of Philadelphia. Check out the group's complete list of tour dates below.

When David Lynch died this January, my life became filled, even more than usual, with short-form videos. These were clips from his movies and TV shows, the little weather reports he self-recorded in his final years, that wonderful footage of Angelo Badalamenti demonstrating how he and Lynch composed Laura Palmer's theme from Twin Peaks. There were also pieces of Lynch's interviews, usually circumspect and deliberately opaque. But one montage punctured that air of inscrutability: a cut of the director saying, over and over through the years, that failing to write down an idea and then forgetting it was one of life's great horrors. He almost always punctuated this thought with the same sentence: “You want to commit suicide.”

About halfway through Neighborhood Gods Unlimited, Open Mike Eagle experiences a version of this: “I dropped my cellphone and it got ran over,” he raps, with the mournfulness of someone recounting a dying friend's last days. “Didn't even see it, now it's in a bunch of pieces.” He croons about the “priceless data written on my machine” and says that his lost voice memos could have been the skeletons for “like eight or nine songs.” At one point he compares the infamous floods that destroyed hundreds of beats in RZA's basement—then hedges, self-conscious. “I should've put it in the cloud,” he concedes. The song is called “ok but I'm the phone screen.”

Over the last decade, Eagle—a Chicago native who moved to Los Angeles and became a key part of the legendary avant-garde collective Project Blowed's second generation—has emerged as one of the most incisive chroniclers of the ways the internet has fractured our existence. On the opening song from 2014's Dark Comedy, he was dismayed that the banal details of his life and habits as a consumer would be valuable to anyone; a few tracks later he was rapping, tongue firmly in cheek, about the new “golden age,” where synthetic opiates are as readily available as “bad spoken word”—and where you can stream Twin Peaks on an iPhone, all that interdimensional dread shrunk down and made to lag and buffer. At one point in “phone screen,” he compares the experience of losing his notes and voice memos to an image that could've come right out of that show: a man “scratched up, trying to climb walls in a dream.”

Neighborhood Gods is conceived as a dispatch from a fictional cable channel with a budget so small that it can only broadcast for one hour a week. And it does convey the texture of that medium, full of ads for wonder drugs and the harebrained barbershop theories from opener “woke up knowing everything”: chemtrails, freemasons, Gatorade laced with mercury. But the album's spirit is unmistakably, claustrophobically online. It's fixated on the ways parts of us are being stripped away and sold back for a price, be it literal or psychic; on “michigan j. wonder,” he raps about being his “own Dr. Frankenstein,” stitching together parts of his spine and flesh that had gone missing. It's a disorienting way to live, and its roots stretch back decades, even centuries. But at his most determined moments, Eagle outlines a plan to claw back a comprehensive sense of self. Later on “michigan,” he repurposes an old line about “by-myself meetings,” first rapped by Cappadonna on Ghostface's Ironman, a masterpiece made in the wake of those floods, when little bits of the artists had seemingly been lost forever.

Though there are pockets of brightness, the melancholy of Kenny Segal's “contraband” and Child Actor's “phone screen” are Neighborhood Gods' prevailing mood. (Child Actor handles nearly half the record, and Segal contributes two beats alongside underground mainstays like K-Nite and August Fanon.) This sadness is not self-pitying—what it communicates, above all else, is desperation. “contraband,” which is subtitled “the plug has bags of me,” is Eagle's organizing metaphor: an itchy, fiendish consumer muttering, “What you got there?/Let me see” about the little pieces of himself available for illicit purchase. The image is tabled; affixed to the following song is a coda that continues this frantic search: “How do I get some more me?/How do I get some more me?”

Eagle is a sly, adaptive songwriter; his Blowed chops are smuggled inside irresistible melodies and a singing voice that has grown more emotive and elastic over the course of his career. (“me and aquil stealing stuff from work” even channels his longtime friend and collaborator Serengeti.) On this album's paralyzing second half, he slips in and out of sometimes wildly disparate vocal modes to communicate that flickering dread. When he recounts a dream about a seemingly omniscient baby, he does so in a regimented syllable pattern that feels, uncannily, like a downward spiral; that the image of this baby crawling across a ceiling and Eagle's self-description as a “random in the ghetto” are mapped onto the same grid makes rips in the fabric of reality and the crushing banality of daily life seem indistinguishable from one another.

The channeling of Lynch is not the only thing Neighborhood Gods has in common with Dark Comedy. That latter album ends with “Big Pretty Bridges,” a missive from a hotel room in Albuquerque during an unexpected lull in a rap tour. That song is its own quiet horror, shot through with the fear that we are all incurably atomized, the gaps between us unbridgeable. Here, Eagle returns with that song's musical twin, the Segal-produced closer “unlimited skull voices.” This time, the problem is the opposite: He can't shut off the chorus of voices fighting for space inside his mind. No barrier—not the drywall of a Holiday Inn, not the quarter-inch of bone around our brains—is enough to keep us severed.

Ten years ago, Eagle articulated this central struggle: “It's hard being brick-and-mortar creatures/My thoughts have to fit in phones and through computer speakers.” What was once a problem of reformatting has evolved, grotesquely, into a sort of soft posthumanism. So he fishes a SIM card out of a destroyed machine to find that it's dead, covered in dust; he communes with the spirits through the cheap vertical blinds of L.A. apartments; he buys himself back little by little.

Occasionally, he grows resolute. “relentless hands and feet” is a celebration of the industriousness that has kept Eagle and his comrades alive. At one point, he raps that “the fact that we exist is magic.” In context, this is a statement of gratitude: Who could believe we overcame all the forces conspiring against us? But as Neighborhood Gods Unlimited plummets to that cacophonous conclusion, the line reverberates. You strip the value judgment from it and remember the things you've learned to associate with magic: misdirection, sleight of hand. An illusion.

	Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave “the inside story” about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America's biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. 


	The official spoke in January at the exclusive Consumers' Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event.


	Brent Webster, the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, recalled how his office moved to cut off lucrative bond business to Wells Fargo. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor's mansion with Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton, and the bank's execs, told the bank Texas could “reinstate the bond market” if it left the Net Zero Banking Alliance.


	When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank's executives they were this close “to being sued right now.”  

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, “you guys might be next.” It worked: “They left a week later,” he said. “They left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and then all the banks followed.” 


	On the plus side for the banks, once they left the alliance, Paxton allowed them to get municipal bond business again. 

	











	Paxton's office did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.


	In a statement, Consumers' Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is “appalled at the lengths that Wall Street's financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,” adding that “we are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton's office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. If big banks and asset managers like BlackRock think that they can intimidate those who oppose their misdeeds into silence … they are mistaken.”

	Consumers' Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. The organization and Leo have worked in coalition with Republican attorneys general, state financial officers, legislators, and national Republican groups to pressure businesses to drop public commitments to ensuring the future habitability of our planet. 


	Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives' “war on woke.” 


	Of course, corporate climate pledges, like the one from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and ESG were nowhere close to solving the global climate crisis. The banks never stopped funding the fossil fuel industry. That hasn't stopped conservatives — ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests — from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action.

	Webster made clear how easy it is to weaponize the legal apparatus of the state to bring the financial industry to its knees. He urged his allies to do the same: “Anybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power … states should be ramping up right now.”


	As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. 

	











	They have led an efficient and thorough campaign. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. 


	Texas, for instance, passed the nation's first law banning banks from the municipal bond business if they are found to be discriminating against the fossil fuel industry. 


	Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch “unsubstantiated” attacks “against climate initiatives,” as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters.


	“At bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,” they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers' Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas' antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. 


	Hild wanted more information — the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, “within weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,” big banks like Wells Fargo “start dropping like flies” from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, “We're not recording this, right? … Please don't quote me, because I'm telling the inside story on this.”


	He then described the leverage he had against Wall Street: potential enforcement actions that could end lucrative profit streams for the banks, and the possibility of long, painful lawsuits.


	“They're all deathly afraid of being sued,” Webster said, explaining: “None of them want to be subject to depositions. None of them want to be subject to discovery.”


	Leo's network has long been the top funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which works to elect GOP attorneys general.. Marble Freedom Trust is the primary vehicle through which Leo disburses the $1.6 billion bequeathed to him from billionaire industrialist Barre Seid for the purpose of waging the right-wing movement's culture war. Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo's dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives.


	According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo's Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers' Research. 


	CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. A key cog in Leo's network, the 85 Fund, was listed as the account holder. 

	











	While the 85 Fund moved its corporate registration to Texas in 2023, the planning documents still listed its address in Washington, D.C., at the same building where Leo's organizations have long operated. 


	Consumers' Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. Just six years after its founding, its workers split to form Consumers Union, which produces the well-regarded Consumer Reports magazine. Meanwhile, Consumers' Research would denounce unions as communist and the group became a shill for the tobacco industry. 


	The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo's agenda. 


	Since 2020, Consumers' Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and “woke capitalism,” with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street.   


	Some of the anti-ESG coalition's biggest partners were in attendance at the Consumers' Research summit, including representatives from ALEC, Heritage Action, and SFOF. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. 


	According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC's largest known donor in 2023. The same year, Hild, Consumers' Research's director, said that Consumers' Research was the largest donor to SFOF. 


	For the past several years, as the Biden administration pursued greater action on climate change, Wall Street sought both to hedge its financial risks, and profit from new financial products touting ESG investing and diversity, equity, and inclusion — marketing them to the climate and socially conscious consumer.


	ESG assesses a company or investment decisions through a sustainability framework, in order to bolster long-term growth and reduce harm. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency.  


	Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. 


	Take for example, a chief target of the Leo coalition — BlackRock, the biggest pension fund manager in the world, with $12.5 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock has been at the forefront of ESG evangelism, while at the same time holding $400 billion in fossil fuel industry investments. 

	











	Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. 


	On a broader level, of course, allowing for maximum climate devastation will be both immensely costly for the citizens of Earth, as well as for business interests.


	At one point at the Consumers' Research summit, Webster spoke about the push to have Republican-led states end any investments with BlackRock, arguing that currently, “red states are funding the war against us.”


	Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems' finances.


	“The biggest problem we have right now is both of our retirement funds, and I'm sure, I'm glad I'm not being quoted here, but they do not have the courage to stand up to BlackRock,” he said.


	He argued that's why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

	“That's the only way we're going to change this system,” he said. “I'll tell you right now, the pension funds in the red states and the bond market in the red states is larger than anything BlackRock has. You have more power than you have ever realized.” 


	Webster continued, “All of their security comes from your pensions and your bond markets. That's where the security for their risky investments come from. If you mess with their security, they have to change their entire business model.”

O
n the morning of June 7, a California State Assemblyman named José Luis Solache Jr. posted a video to his Instagram account of a phalanx of Customs and Border Patrol vehicles congregated across the street from a Home Depot in Paramount, California, a small city in Los Angeles County with a large Latino population. The video wasn't particularly notable — just a shaky recording of a bunch of idling SUVs and pickup trucks — and, in fact, it was fairly staid compared to the countless videos flooding social media over the past few months depicting the interactions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal law-enforcement agencies with the communities they are ostensibly employed to serve. 


	Most of these videos depict brawny, heavily armed, masked dudes in tactical gear, sunglasses, and backward baseball hats, chasing and tackling unarmed immigrants while yelling things like, “Get on the ground!” and “Do not resist!” Most also feature a cast of bystanders recording the action on their phones, reminding victims of their constitutional rights, demanding agents identify themselves or produce a warrant, and then showering abuse on them when they refuse.

	











	So, if we're judging these recordings on their dramatic tension and character development, the Paramount video was a dud. But its timing was pointed. A day earlier, hundreds protesting a recent ICE raid marched on the federal building downtown and were met by Department of Homeland Security agents and LAPD officers armed with batons and firing pepper-balls. By the following morning, Solache's Paramount video was like a flare sent up to a community already on edge. 

	











	Community members came out to voice their displeasure, wielding cameras and posting their own videos, as armed agents fired rubber bullets, tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and other so-called less lethal munitions at protesters. That batch of videos in turn brought out more protesters with more cameras.

	“We got the call so I was there the whole day and watched everything unfold,” says Francisco Romero. “I was on the front line monitoring the violence.”


	Romero, 49, is a longtime community organizer with Unión del Barrio, a group which formed in San Diego in 1981 as a socialist political organization focused on the rights of immigrants from Latin America. They first began patrolling neighborhoods in Southern California in 1993 to keep watch over police who'd been a constant presence in Latino communities there, but during the early days of Donald Trump's first administration, UdB began holding “Know Your Rights” workshops and conducting patrols to alert community members to ICE presence. 


	UdB's ICE Watch program became something of a model for other similarly inclined groups around the country, which have popped up in nearly every large city and many smaller municipalities over the past few years. Almost all are small, grassroots organizations. Many lean socialist or focus on workers' rights. Their efforts, largely unconnected to the apparatus of the Democratic Party or mainstream progressive organizations, have formed the backbone of the public response to the shocking sight of masked government agents snatching people off American streets in broad daylight. 


	“The waters are being tested around the militarization of our community,” says Romero, whose day job is in public health. “They're trying to normalize this, and we're saying, ‘No, this is not normal. This is unjust.'”


	These small organizations, staffed almost entirely by volunteers, have begun to incur the wrath of congressional Republicans eager to curry favor with the Trump administration. In June, GOP members in both the House and the Senate launched investigations into non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work on behalf of immigrants. California Republican Kevin Kiley also introduced the “No Tax Dollars for Riots” act, which aims to end tax-exempt status for nonprofits that participate in supposedly unlawful protests. (Trump enthusiastically endorsed the bill on Truth Social.)

	Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” will funnel tens of billions more dollars towards immigration enforcement, increasing ICE's budget significantly. Faceoffs between ICE and these cash-strapped groups that have made it their mission to defend immigrants are likely just beginning.


	NIKKI MARÍN BAENA CO-FOUNDED SIEMBRA NC in 2017 to protect Latino worker's rights in North Carolina, but the mission was quickly recalibrated as the first Trump administration's hardline immigration policies began to take hold. After the 2024 election, interest in this work was turbocharged. 


	“The weekend after the inauguration, we had scheduled two ICE Watch trainings, one in Raleigh, one in Durham,” says Marín Baena, 40, of the sessions teaching community members strategies for confronting immigration agents in their neighborhoods. “We could not fit people in the places we'd booked. We had lines wrapping around the block, like a thousand people.”


	Whereas the shock and horror of the family-separation policy during Trump's first term eventually put the administration on the defensive, this time around, the intimidation seems to be the point, as agents have begun to scour places like Home Depot and 7-Eleven. The second iteration “is kind of a TV show about how cruel you can be to a group of people,” says Marín Baena. “In this moment, they're going after immigrants regardless of their [immigration] status or what protections they had. The panic is significantly higher. You get the sense this could happen anywhere, at any time, to anyone.”


	This has motivated more people to fight back, forming groups and alliances to defend immigrants. Across Southern California, UdB is part of a growing network of more than 60 organizations called the Community Self-Defense Coalition, which shares tools and resources. In other parts of the country, these sorts of coalitions emerged on the fly in the early days of Trump's second term. 


	“It has been a beautiful, messy process where we're sort of learning and building it as we go along,” says Elsabel Rincon, who runs an immigrant advocacy nonprofit in Salem, Massachusetts, and is also part of LUCE, a Massachusetts-based network that runs its own ICE Watch programs and steers immigrants toward legal resources to defend against detention and deportation. 


	In different parts of the country, more established organizations have lent their expertise to new ones. Siembra NC offered vital support to the LUCE Network. Unión del Barrio has helped groups nationwide. 

	











	The question is, can these scrappy, grassroots organizations scattered around the country mount an effective response to the militarized might of the federal government? As the Trump administration directs more resources and more vitriol into this battle, as immigrant communities and their allies come under even more fire, what exactly would success even look like in this David-versus-Goliath battle?


	IN LATE MAY, IN THE SANCTUARY of a small brick church in Antioch, Tennessee, a working-class neighborhood on Nashville's outskirts, about 50 people are seated in the pews, listening to volunteers from a group called the ReMix TN explain strategies for countering immigration raids. 


	The afternoon begins with group breathing exercises. “We know there's a lot of tension that comes with the work we do and the season we're going through,” says Lhoraine, a session leader, who asked to be identified only by her first name.


	Although tense confrontations have become the most visible sign of resistance to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, the message this afternoon is that you don't have to confront an agent in order to help. Some at the church plan to visit local workplaces to hand out “Know Your Rights” cards to workers. Others talk about legislative work and policy initiatives. And then there is a group in the lobby boxing up groceries to take to families that don't feel safe leaving the house.


	Music City Migra-Watch recently spun off from ReMix and keeps tabs on local ICE activity by responding to tips from community members. Migra-Watch sends out trained volunteers to verify that sightings submitted via social media or a telephone hotline are in fact ICE or other immigration-enforcement agents. If they are, the group alerts the community, reminds the raid's target of their rights and records the episode on their phones. 


	More and more, bystanders are already recording by the time the trained volunteers arrive. In trainings, groups like Migra-Watch emphasize not only the rights of the immigrants targeted, but the legal rights of those recording federal agents. 


	“We tell people their role is never to escalate a situation,” says Rincon of the LUCE network. “We train people to ask agents what department they're with and what they're doing in the community. We encourage people to ask if the individuals have a warrant.”

	











	There is a federal statute that makes it illegal to resist, interfere, or obstruct a law-enforcement agent carrying out their official duties, as well as a separate law that criminalizes knowingly harboring, concealing, or shielding someone from detection by immigration authorities. In the chaotic moments when many of these ICE raids go down, what constitutes obstruction gets murky fast. The application of these laws often comes down to exactly who is parsing the language. 


	“This administration subscribes to the broadest interpretation of the statutes,” says John Sandweg, an immigration attorney who served during the Obama administration as general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, and later as ICE director. Bystanders recording an interaction with ICE, asking to see a warrant, or advising people of their rights “is not anything that during an Obama or Biden administration would've been prosecuted. But this is a time where that kind of activity is going to get much greater scrutiny from the Department of Justice, so those groups are operating with a greater degree of risk than ever before.”


	Certainly this fact has been driven home by the sight of a number of public officials including New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, and Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan being arrested for allegedly interfering with ICE operations. 


	Romero is confident that he and others from UdB have the law on their side. “We walk it up to the point just shy of them having an excuse to get us an obstruction charge,” he says. “We know the limit, and that's where we stand.”


	SHERMAN AUSTIN KNOWS WHAT IT'S like when they come for you. On Jan. 24, 2002, Austin was an 18-year-old webmaster, political activist, and budding rapper living with his mother in Sherman Oaks, California, when roughly two dozen federal agents raided and ransacked their home. Austin ran RaiseTheFist.com, an anarchist website and discussion forum, which, particularly in the months after the 9/11 attacks, had drawn the attention of the federal government. Among other things, a teenager had posted amateurish bomb-making instructions to RaiseTheFist.com, and although that teenager was never charged, Austin served nearly a year in federal prison for hosting the information on his site. The case made him a cause célèbre among left-wing activists, including Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha, and free-speech advocates who claimed Austin was targeted for his political beliefs. 

	











	Today, Austin runs StopICE.net, a crowdsourced, text-based alert system that notifies users of ICE sightings. When I first spoke to Austin in early May, the platform was still in its infancy, and had roughly 9,000 subscribers, mostly around the Southern California area. By the time we reconnect in mid-June, after the massive protests around L.A., more than 270,000 people from all over the country have signed up for StopICE's notifications. The site's Instagram page, which mostly shares videos of ICE raids and drives traffic toward the alert system, has more than 80,000 followers. 


	“Things exploded with the platform,” he tells me. “Things happened so rapidly that I didn't have the resources in place to keep everything functional, 24/7. The system was crashing a bit.” 


	Austin has been coordinating more and more with the rapid-response teams from immigrant defense groups, helping to filter information to them about ICE raids in real time. 


	His is not the only platform helping to knit together the nationwide raids and responses. The site People Over Papers solicits similar information from users and plots it onto a map of the U.S. An app called ICE Block that allows users to alert each other of ICE activity shot to the top of the iTunes app-store charts after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced it by name during a late June press briefing, claiming the app “is encouraging violence against law enforcement officers.”


	Austin first had the idea for StopICE back in 2017, but it wasn't until this February, after witnessing the new administration's tactics and recognizing the echo of his own experiences, that he finally got the system up and running. 


	“I've gone through all this shit before with the feds,” he says. “I know what it's like to be snatched off the street by federal agents, thrown into a black van for a trip to a federal building, and have my family not know where I'm at for two weeks.”


	Multiple people I spoke to while reporting this story were understandably reluctant to be named. Considering the Trump administration's demonstrated thirst for retribution, many were concerned about putting a target on themselves or their organizations. Austin, despite his previous entanglements with the federal government, has no such reservations.


	“I want to show that contrast,” he says. “We're seeing these masked ICE agents who don't want to reveal their identity snatching people off the streets. Here I am trying to counter that the best way I can, by providing the resources for people in real time to get organized and mobilized. But I'm not trying to hide myself. I don't have to wear a mask. I don't have to conceal my identity because I'm not breaking the law.”

	











	IT CAN BE TRICKY TO MEASURE THE efficacy of these immigrant-defense operations. There aren't statistics tallying detentions and deportations that don't happen, or any real way to count the number of immigrants who feel safe enough to go to work, the supermarket, or their child's parent-teacher conference because of these programs. But certainly the messages these organizations have repeated over the past six months — about constitutional rights, about community defense — have resonated widely. 


	“People are holding the line,” Romero says. “People are maintaining their silence. People know the difference between an administrative and judicial warrant. It's spreading.”


	It's clear deportation hardliners have taken notice, as well. In early June, the Republican chairmen of the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability launched an investigation into more than 200 NGOs that work with immigrants, including Unión del Barrio and Siembra NC. As the letter these organizations received spells out, the probe hopes to discover whether these groups “used U.S. taxpayer money to … facilitate illegal immigration,” and whether “certain NGOs are now advising illegal aliens on strategies to avoid and impede law-enforcement officials.” 


	Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley launched an additional investigation into three groups — UdB, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, and the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights (CHIRLA) — accusing them of financing and providing material support for the recent protests in Paramount and around Los Angeles. “Bankrolling civil unrest is not protected speech,” Hawley wrote in a letter dated June 11. “It is aiding and abetting criminal conduct.” 


	Early in the morning on June 12, the FBI raided a home in East L.A. and arrested Alejandro Orellana, who volunteers with one of the Unión del Barrio's coalition partners. He's accused of providing masks and face shields to L.A. protesters. 


	When California Rep. Kiley introduced his “No Tax Dollars for Riots” bill the following day, he singled out CHIRLA as a potential target.  


	According to Romero, UdB is “tripling down” on their work. “You're asking us to voluntarily cease and desist. That's not happening.” 

	











	The weekend after receiving the letter, UdB got a tip that more than 200 federal agents were meeting up early on a Sunday morning in a parking lot in Bell, California, to plan raids for the day. The organization flooded the staging area with volunteers. “Some of us were able to monitor where they were headed,” Romero says. “We started alerting people to get into self-defense mode.” With each of these episodes, lessons are being learned and new strategies devised. 


	At the June protests in Paramount, the situation on the streets escalated throughout the day and into the night. Federal agents called in the local police and the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. The LASD has committed to not cooperating on immigration-enforcement operations, but Romero says the Sheriff's deputies he encountered in Paramount were even more violent than the federal agents. 


	CBP officers shot rubber bullets and soft pellets at protesters — ”I got hit a bunch of times,” Romero says — but when they fired tear gas canisters, they generally seemed to aim at the ground or over the heads of demonstrators. Not so for the sheriff's deputies, according to Romero. 


	“I witnessed a sheriff intentionally aim straight at the face of a person who was filming,” Romero says. “This youngster got laid out, his face got cracked open, just under his eye. I had to go provide first aid. That's happened multiple times.” (In a statement, a spokesperson for the LASD writes that the crowd was “throwing objects and exhibiting violent behavior toward federal agents and deputy sheriffs.… When a protest is deemed an unlawful assembly and individuals resort to violence, intervention becomes necessary.”)


	What didn't happen in Paramount is also notable: It appeared that federal agents, engaged with raucous protesters, were largely unable to go out into the community in search of immigrants. The protests eventually spread to nearby Compton and downtown Los Angeles. In response, Trump sent the National Guard into Los Angeles and mobilized 700 U.S. Marines nearby, despite the fact that no local authorities — not the police chief, not the mayor, not the governor — thought it was warranted.

	Despite the violence and the draconian backlash, in some ways what happened in Paramount felt like a victory for Unión del Barrio and groups like it, proof of concept that the seeds they're planting are taking root. 


	“The community is watching out for their own block, and that's exactly what needs to happen — community-level self-defense, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood,” Romero says. “There's this trickle effect beginning where it's no longer a feeling of being isolated. It's a feeling of ‘Hey, there's a resistance going on. I want to be part of it.'”

	In a late night vote at the Capitol on Monday, House Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to unseal documents related to the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Republicans have long stoked conspiracies about the disgraced financier's death, voted against the resolution in the heat of a MAGA civil war over the Trump administration's backtracking on the release of the files. 


	The House Rules Committee voted down a bid by Democrats to attach an amendment to the GENIUS Act — a controversial piece of cryptocurrency legislation currently making its way through Congress — that would have allowed Congress to vote on whether to compel the Justice Department to make public documents and information related to the case. The vote failed 6-5, with only one Republican joining Democrats to vote in favor of the amendment. 


	Last week, the Justice Department shocked the MAGA media universe by releasing a memo announcing that they are closing the investigation into Epstein, that Epstein died by suicide, and there is no “incriminating” client list of people who potentially participated in Epstein's sex trafficking ring that merits further inquiry. The memo contradicted preaching from prominent figures within the administration — including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel — about the need to expose the real circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, and bring justice to victims.

Rolling Stone reported that the administration knew the memo would cause a revolt within their base. Now that the administration is struggling to put the lid back on the conspiratorial Pandora's Box, Democrats are making a point to egg on the strife on the other side of the aisle. 

	











	“Why are the Epstein files still hidden? Who are the rich & powerful being protected?” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who introduced the failed amendment, wrote Saturday night on X. “On Tuesday, I'm introducing an amendment to force a vote demanding the FULL Epstein files be released to the public. The Speaker must call a vote & put every Congress member on record.”

	Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) even composed a parody song to the tune of Jason Isbell's “Dreamsicle,” in which he mocked Republicans for “telling us you'd release the files.” 


	“You've had plenty of time / You're in control / But now you say / You will withhold — the Epstein files,” Johnson sang. 


	Last week the Democratic National Committee launched an automated X account dubbed the “TrumpEpsteinBot.” Every day the bot, with the name “Has Trump Released the Epstein Files,” posts the word “no.” 


	“Wow who would have thought that electing a rapist would have complicated the release of the Epstein Files?” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), wrote last Friday on X, referencing longstanding allegations of sexual assault against President Trump. 


	For his own part, Trump is trying to combat the fallout with a conspiracy theory of his own: that the Democrats actually created the files.

	“We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people'; are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein. For years, it's Epstein, over and over again,” he wrote Saturday on Truth Social. “Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration, who conned the World with the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, 51 ‘Intelligence” Agents, ‘HE LAPTOP FROM HELL,' and more? They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called ‘friends' are playing right into their hands.” 


	Epstein died in 2019, in the middle of Trump's first presidency. The government's files on the matter will apparently remain hidden through the course of his second.

	About a month after National Guard troops and federal officers on horseback descended on MacArthur Park, where children at a summer day camp were reportedly present, California Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed Donald Trump for deploying the U.S. military to Los Angeles.


	“They're sitting there on horses with American flags, running through soccer fields, scaring kids in the middle of the day at a summer camp. For what? Just toughness,”  Newsom said on The Shawn Ryan Show. “It's a weakness masquerading as strength.”


	Newsom then slammed Trump, whose administration's ICE raids have devastated many small businesses, particularly those within large immigrant communities. “That's what I don't like about this son of a bitch,” said the governor. “He calls me ‘Newscum.' How do I explain that to my kid? Now, I have my kids' friends calling my kids ‘Newscum.' That I get, because I was called that in seventh grade, but not by a 79 year old.” He added: “Model better goddamn behavior.”

	











	Last month, Trump mobilized thousands of National Guard troops to L.A. amid anti-Immigrations and Customs Enforcements (ICE) protests in Los Angeles without the request or consent of city and state officials. Newsom has remained vehemently critical of the president, lambasting Trump for inciting chaos, using valuable resources, and militarizing city streets.

	In a ruling against the Trump administration on Friday, a federal judge temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to make indiscriminate immigration arrests. For the past month, agents have conducted raids in public and at workplaces across Southern California, showing up at Home Depots, restaurants, and car washes and arresting Spanish-speaking day laborers on immigration charges.

	











	“Justice prevailed today,” wrote Newsom on social media following the ruling. “The court's decision puts a temporary stop to federal immigration officials violating people's rights and racial profiling. California stands with the law and the Constitution — and I call on the Trump Administration to do the same.”

KUCHING, July 15: Members of the public have been urged not to speculate or jump to conclusions over a recent viral image that allegedly showed a Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flying over Saratok.

In a statement issued by the Ministry of Transport Sarawak (MOTS), its minister, Dato Sri Lee Kim Shin, said that while such sightings often arouse public curiosity, it is critical to respond with rationality rather than panic or baseless assumptions.

He emphasised that any sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) should be immediately reported to the relevant authorities, especially the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), and, if necessary, to the police.

“This includes visual documentation such as photos or videos, as well as details about the object's appearance, such as its shape, size, and colour, along with any notable sounds, behaviours, the time of day, and weather conditions at the time of the sighting.”

According to the minister, information like this is critical in helping authorities or researchers analyse and verify aerial phenomena. He also advised individuals who witness such events to maintain a safe distance from the object, especially if it is behaving erratically or unpredictably, adding that public safety should always be the top priority.

Lee further commented on claims that the object might be a B-2 bomber, explaining that such aircraft, which are powered by four General Electric jet engines each producing over 17,000 pounds of thrust, would have generated a deafening noise if flying at the altitude shown in the photograph. The absence of such sound in this case strongly suggests that the object was not a B-2.

Based on information received from aviation authorities, he said the object was likely a remote-controlled aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which are increasingly common in recreational and commercial use.

He also encouraged the public to learn more about common aerial phenomena, including drones, weather balloons, and remote-controlled planes, so that unusual sightings can be better understood and responsibly reported.

Joseph Buchman speaks to an audience on July 5 at the Roswell UFO Festival. 

Joseph Buchman has never held public office before, but it is not for lack of trying.

Buchman teaches courses in media studies and researches issues related to alleged alien life forms. He spoke about congressional campaigns during a presentation at the UFO Festival on July 5 at the International UFO Museum in Roswell.

Buchman has made three bids for Congress in Utah, two as a Libertarian and one as an independent, in 2008, 2017 and 2023 (the latter two were special elections). He has also had his name on the ballot twice for the Utah Legislature, and made an unsuccessful run for Utah treasurer.

In each of those races, Buchman was a critic of the mounting national debt. He has set himself apart from the pack with a persistent call for Congress to pass legislation that frees whistleblowers and witnesses with evidence of waste, fraud and abuse, criminal activity or evidence of interaction between human and nonhuman intelligence. He is a staunch advocate for disclosure of any evidence of extraterrestrial life forms.

Buchman explained that he is not sure exactly when he became interested in the issue of extraterrestrials and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), the term now given to what were once referred to as unidentified flying objects. However, he does believe that an experience he had as a teenager could have had something to do with it.

As an Indiana high school student in 1974, Buchman won a trip to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, a prize for finishing first place in a science fair. At the time, a friend of his urged Buchman a lot to ask about a UFO that was said to be on the base. But Buchman said he has little memory of the actual trip itself.

“I remember waking up in the car on the ride home, and I had no memory... of what happened to me at Wright Patterson Air Force Base,” Buchman said.

He has tried many ways, from therapy and memory recovery techniques, but to no avail. He reports to having one memory from the debacle about giving someone permission to stick a syringe in him. He also recalls having an unexplained urge, after graduating, to take a job with Sandia Labs, something that Buchman said he ultimately decided against.

Buchman embarked on his first of many jaunts on the campaign trail in 2008, a time during which he was still contemplating what he could do with his life and how he could make the biggest difference in the world. He then imagined what an extraterrestrial would think if they came to Earth and reported on their findings. Buchman said those life forms would see a world building nuclear weapons, humans killing each other and attempting to devise new ways of killing each other.

“It would sound something like ‘Hey dad, we made a mess of things. We know we can't make it right on our own, give us a hand,'” he said.

Buchman concluded that an apology would be a good way to start a conversation from those non-Earth natives, and so he launched a website, thepeopleofearthapologize.com.

“I figured if aliens were here, they are downloading the internet, their AI is analyzing it,” Buchman told the audience.

He argued that other life forms could provide insight on how to make a more peaceful world and tackle issues such as finding new sources of renewable energy.

After launching the website, Buchman received a call from the Utah chapter of the Libertarian Party asking him to make a bid for Congress. Eventually, Buchman agreed, making his announcement in Washington, D.C., at the National Press Club, with a banner hanging behind him, which stated, “It's not about lights in the sky, it is about lies on the ground.”

Buchman also read from a voter guide from 2023, which claimed that “the most important political issue of our time is our place in the cosmos.” He notes that such knowledge and interactions with lifeforms from other planets — assuming satisfactory evidence for their existence is ever discovered — help address some of the world's most pressing and potentially destructive challenges, through dialogue with them and perhaps the use of some of their presumably advanced technologies.

“Imagine the possibilities of having more on earth, resources for clean energy and hope for a future of peace and prosperity,” he said.

But from the start, Buchman knew his chances of winning the race were slim, given the two-party system that dominates the political process.

“I knew I had no chance of winning this seat in the United States House, barring the death of every single other candidate, and even then, they would probably find a way to elect someone else,” he said.

Instead, Buchman said his campaign was about inspiring conversation about UAP and other alleged alien life forms and providing those with information about a possible program with the means to tell the truth and rein in a program that Buchman argued was being funded without proper congressional oversight.

“It was a lot of fun. I probably invested a couple thousand dollars into buying radio ads, trying to get earned media,” he said.

The emphasis on the extraterrestrial did garner Buchman and his family attention, but also ridicule. He even said his children were teased at school. In his 2008 campaign, Buchman recalled a profile of his candidacy appeared in the newspaper, the Park City Record, with the headline “Immigration, taxes and little green men; candidate wants feds to view information about aliens.”

Buchman said many of his fellow Libertarians were less than enthusiastic about his constant talk of aliens. One strategist, a former political director with the national Libertarian Party, even tried to get him removed from the ballot.

“They thought I was a tinfoil-hat-wearing nut who was bringing disgrace upon the party,” he said.

Despite those reactions and the outcome, Buchman does not believe his campaigns were a waste of time and energy.

He noted that during his campaign he was able to get out his message and was offered to attend forums he would not otherwise be able to have access to. That included participating in public debates with other candidates. In 2017, Buchman was able to take part in a debate hosted by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group.

As a third-party candidate he had to fight his way to get on the debate stage with three Republicans and one Democrat in the race. When Buchman found out about the debate, he informed the organizers and told them he wanted in. After threatening a lawsuit, Buchman was eventually included in the forum.

“I was absolutely terrified to walk on stage with those guys, and then I had a ton of fun. It was a blast,” he said, adding that his message from those campaigns is now part of the historical archive. “I've gotten media coverage. Those radio ads are out there are out there. The hard record thing is there, the websites are archived, but the biggie is the personal relationships.”

That time on the campaign trail allowed him to build connections, such as one with an opponent in the 2017, Republican John Curtis. Curtis ultimately won and last year was elected to the U.S. Senate. Buchman said that later Curtis would invite him to other debates. Buchman has had various speaking engagements since then.

“This is not a new idea. The idea that maybe we need to humble ourselves and begin a conversation with some benign and benevolent life,” he said.

The visit of a doll steeped in paranormal legend to Gettysburg ended in tragedy this weekend with the sudden passing of one of the national tour's lead organizers, according to the New England Society for Psychic Research, the organization behind the tour.

Dan Rivera, 54, the lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research and a U.S. Army veteran, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, July 13, 2025, during his visit to Gettysburg, the society announced on Monday evening.

Rivera was among the leading faces of the viral ""Devils on the Run Tour,"" in which Rivera and other members of the New England Society for Psychic Research had brought the allegedly haunted doll, Annabelle, across the country to various sites.

Adams County dispatch scanner archives show that firefighters and medical personnel had been called to a hotel in Gettysburg on Sunday evening for a report of CPR in progress on a male patient of Rivera's age.

The Gettysburg leg of the tour, which was hosted by Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours at the Soldiers National Orphanage, completely sold out, organizers said, selling over 1,260 tickets across three days on the weekend of Friday, July 11, 2025, with the visit concluding on Sunday afternoon.

Rivera had helped bring the tour to international attention through his public outreach, including numerous viral TikTok videos that Rivera produced with paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell that racked up millions of views as the doll was taken across the country.

The tour had garnered extensive publicity in recent months, even sparking outrage in several locations as many took to social media over superstitions regarding the doll's storied past.

In the hours that followed the announcement of Rivera's death on Monday evening, an outpouring of tributes and memorials to Rivera began to pop up across the paranormal community, remembering Rivera for his passion for sharing the paranormal and as a caring husband, father and friend.

On Saturday, the Evening Sun was in attendance at the Gettysburg event as Rivera led one of the sold-out tours for patrons to view the Annabelle doll.

Prior to leading the group into the room to view the doll, Rivera was full of charisma as he joked with visitors about the viral fame of the tour and emphasized his focus on making a positive experience for their visit.

""I want you guys to have a good time,"" he told the group gathered at the orphanage.

Rivera, who was mentored by famous paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren, told those gathered at the event about the steps he had taken to ""protect them"" from the doll, including the case housing the doll that Rivera had built himself.

That case, Rivera told the group, he built with three crosses, representing the holy trinity, and is stained in a finish that contained holy water.

In his remarks, Rivera joked that ""we did not burn down that plantation,"" and ""we did not free those prisoners,"" referencing some of the viral instances that social media had attempted to tie to the doll's journey.

Later in the tour, Rivera added that Annabelle had not caused a 911 outage that sent wireless emergency alerts blaring across cellphones Pennsylvania, including inside of the first showings of the doll a day prior.

Speaking of his late mentor, Rivera shared with the audience that her guidance for protecting oneself from ""evil spirits"" entailed almost a form of meditation.

""What Lorraine would say to protect yourself,"" said Rivera, ""is to close your eyes and envision yourself in a halo of white light.""

Biographies for Rivera described an ""insatiable curiosity"" about the paranormal from a young age that led to Rivera founding his own paranormal investigation group after his service in the U.S. Army.

That curiosity also led Rivera to attend lectures from Lorraine Warren, where biographies said Warren had taken Rivera under her wing and mentored him in the last years of her life, eventually leading to his appointment as the lead investigator for NESPR in 2011.

NESPR was founded in 1952 by Ed and Lorraine Warren, who were known for their paranormal investigations of ""The Amityville Horror"" house on Long Island, the ""Enfield Poltergeist,"" and the Annabelle doll.

The legend of Annabelle, and the stories of the Warrens, went on to inspire a lucrative film series, ""The Conjuring,"" which became the highest-grossing horror series worldwide as of 2023, cementing the Warrens', and Annabelle's, place in pop culture history.

After Ed Warren's passing in 2006, then Lorraine's passing in 2019, NESPR and the Warrens' occult museum collection in Connecticut has been maintained by their daughter, Judy Spera, and their son-in-law, Tony Spera.

While the museum closed to the public in 2019 over zoning issues, the items within the Warrens' museums have in recent years traveled around the country to be displayed.

In addition to his work with NESPR, Rivera had been featured as a paranormal investigator on television, such as the Travel Channel's ""Most Haunted Places,"" as well as serving as a producer for paranormal television series such as Netflix's ""28 Days Haunted.""

In a tribute to Rivera by Buell, Buell shared that Rivera had cared extensively for Lorraine near the end of her life.

""He devoted his time, passionately, to keeping Ed and Lorraine's legacy alive,"" Buell wrote in the post.

Buell, who worked with Rivera on the tour, noted Rivera's success in helping continue the Warrens' story in recent years through organizing the paranormal convention ParaCon, which visited Gettysburg in 2024, as well as the Annabelle tour, which Buell said had ""introduced a whole new generation to Ed and Lorraine Warren's legacy.""

Rivera's work involving the paranormal extended beyond publicity, according to the post, including what Buell said was private work that Rivera and NESPR undertook to assist families that were allegedly haunted.

""Just as Ed and Lorraine did,"" Buell noted.

The news of Rivera's passing quickly spread among those involved in the tour and through social media on Monday night.

In the announcement by NESPR, fellow investigator Chris Gilloren, who was among those at the Gettysburg event, recalled Rivera's passion and enjoyment of sharing his love for the paranormal with others.

""Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal,"" Gilloren wrote. ""His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him.""

""We are heartbroken and still processing this loss,"" Gilloren said in the statement from himself, fellow NESPR investigator Wade Kirby, and Spera.

""Thank you for your support and kind thoughts during this difficult time.""

Mary Jo Chudley, of Penn Paranormal in Bucks County, had been among those who participated in the event on Saturday, and shared a tribute to the group's extensive social media following.

""A true legend was lost, both in life and in the paranormal,"" Chudley wrote. ""He was one of the kindest, most genuine and funniest guys I've ever known.""

On Buell's post, hundreds of comments and thousands of reactions were shared within just two hours of the post being made, many of which were additional tributes to Rivera.

Many of those commenters spoke highly of their own interactions with Rivera at various paranormal events, recalling his enjoyment of sharing his love for the paranormal with others.

As the news circulated around various paranormal communities, some resurfaced a 2020 post from Rivera that was made in tribute to his own personal mentor, Lorraine, on the anniversary of her passing.

""Does life really end?"" Rivera began the 2020 post which included a photograph of the joint grave of the two famous investigators, ""I've asked myself that question today.""

""My answer was, in life, we leave a piece of ourselves with loved ones and friends on our journey through life until there are no more pieces to give away. You would think that is the end, but, when you look back at all the pieces you gave away, those pieces will always be remembered.""

""So I say I will never die,"" Rivera wrote. ""My journey has only begun.""","{'href': 'https://www.eveningsun.com', 'title': 'The Evening Sun'}","other"

University of California, Irvine (UCI) scientists conducting a fresh analysis of data from hundreds of exoplanets, including Earth-like planets that could potentially sustain extraterrestrial life, have discovered several cases where ‘interstellar contamination' caused by light from nearby stars resulted in previous models overestimating a planet's size.

Because a planet's size is a critical component in most models predicting potential exoplanet habitability, UCI doctoral student and study lead author Te Han believes the team's findings could eliminate several candidate exoplanets previously considered favorable places for astrobiologists to search for extraterrestrial life.

“We found that hundreds of exoplanets are larger than they appear, and that shifts our understanding of exoplanets on a large scale,” Han explained in a statement.

Since 1995, when scientists discovered the first planet outside of Earth's solar system, newer and more powerful observation tools have increased the confirmed list of exoplanets to over 5,000. Although researchers have employed several techniques to make those discoveries, most discoveries involve measuring the dip in a star's light as an exoplanet passes between it and Earth.

“We're basically measuring the shadow of the planet,” explained Paul Robertson, UC Irvine professor of astronomy and study co-author.

Dubbed the transit method, this technique allowed the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to discover more exoplanets than any other tool, including the Hubble Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. Along with determining an exoplanet's likely orbit, mass, and density, the TESS data helps scientists estimate its size.

Curious if models predicting the size of an exoplanet had factored in the interstellar contamination caused by light from nearby stars, Han's team combed through the TESS data archives. As expected, they found that light from a neighboring star can end up added to the light from a host star. If models don't take this excess light into account, they may assume a planet is smaller than it is, since a smaller planet would block less of its host planet's light during transit.

Having confirmed the interstellar contamination, Han and colleagues reexamined hundreds of previous TESS exoplanet discoveries. First, they categorized the studies based on the method of exoplanet radius measurement employed by the researchers. Han said this data allowed the UCI team to estimate how much the exoplanet's size had been biased due to interstellar contamination. Next, the team compared the data with observations gathered by the GAIA satellite mission, which further supported the interstellar contamination findings.

“TESS data are contaminated, which Te's custom model corrects better than anyone else in the field,” Robertson explained.

In their study, Han, Robertson, and colleagues explain how correcting for this interstellar contamination has led to significant changes in the characteristics of the exoplanets they studied. Robertson said that perhaps the study's most significant discovery, especially for researchers searching for extraterrestrial life, is that exoplanet candidates that might be home to ET “may systematically be larger than we initially thought.”

“It raises the question: Just how common are Earth-sized planets?” Robertson asks.

One example cited by Han was the discovery of single-planet systems by TESS. According to the researcher, only three such TESS discoveries were thought to have compositions similar to Earth. After correcting for interstellar contamination, “all of them are actually bigger than we thought.”

In the study's conclusion, the research team explains how their interstellar contamination findings affect the search for Extraterrestrial life. For example, although some scientists have begun to rethink what form life outside Earth might take, most models still favor looking for places that can support liquid water, are rocky like Earth, and have a relatively similar size. If Han's new model is correct and many planets we initially thought were Earth-like are much larger, they may not be rocky at all. Instead, they may be theoretical ‘water worlds' covered by one giant ocean. They may also be gaseous planets like Neptune and Uranus.

“This has important implications for our understanding of exoplanets, including, among other things, prioritization for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, and the controversial existence of a galactic population of water worlds,” Roberston explained.

Hoping to add to the potentially habitable exoplanet list instead of taking away from it, Han and his team plan to reexamine TESS data for candidates that were previously dismissed but now may be viable candidates for extraterrestrial life due to the inclusion of interstellar contamination in their size and composition estimates. The team also wants to let other exoplanet researchers know about the interstellar contamination phenomenon so they can correct for it in their transit models.

Cosmos science journalist

Scientists are looking down at the alien-looking creatures on the bottom of Earth's deep sea to figure out what kind of extraterrestrial life may exist up in space.

Extraterrestrial life is most likely to be microbial, contrary to popular culture's depiction of little grey beings with big heads and black eyes. There are some candidate moons and planets within our own solar system which could harbour such life.

The discovery of life evolving somewhere else would be one of the greatest in the history of science, answering the age-old question: are we alone?

Finding extraterrestrial life within our own solar system would suggest that, not only are we not alone, but the universe is likely to be teeming with inhabited worlds.

One candidate for extraterrestrial life is Europa, Jupiter's fourth largest moon.

Europa has a surface of solid ice. But it is one of at least 3 Jovian moons which astronomers believe could have salty oceans of liquid water beneath its icy exterior. NASA observations suggest that Europa's icy crust could be 15–25km thick. The liquid ocean beneath could be up to 150km deep.

One more ingredient would make Europa habitable: if the moon has a hot, molten core which supplies the ocean floor with heat and crucial minerals.

“We think, based on our own planet, that Europa may have conditions that can support life,” says James Holden, a microbiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US.

Holden is leading an expedition, not to outer space, but to a region which is even less understood: Earth's deep ocean floor. He believes that the hydrothermal vents thousands of metres beneath the surface are prime sites to study what life on other worlds might be like.

“I've been looking at deep-sea volcanoes since 1988,” he says. “To get our microbes from them, we use submarines – sometimes human-occupied, sometimes robotic – to dive a mile below the surface and bring the samples ashore and back into my lab.”

NASA has awarded Holden's team nearly $1 million (US$621,000) to study Earth's deep-sea microbes over 3 years, providing insights into possible life on Europa including what signs to look for to confirm whether Jupiter's moon also supports life.

“Because Europa's conditions might be similar to the conditions these microbes come from, we think that Europan life, if it exists, should look something like our own hydrothermal microbes,” Holden explains.

“We have long had a basic interest in knowing if there is life beyond our planet and how that life would function. It's exciting to think that the answer to the secret might be here on our own planet.”

On Earth, deep-sea microbes produce energy by breaking down hydrogen from the hydrothermal vents using enzymes called hydrogenases. Different types of hydrogenases work in different ways, performing a variety of functions in different cells.

Holden's team will use their understanding of Earth's deep-sea microbes to try and understand how microbes on a world with different chemistry would live.

“We need to figure out the different chemical processes that Europan microbial life might be using in order to create energy,” Holden says. “Different chemistries could create very different kinds of microbes.”

NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft launched in October 2024 and is on a 5-year mission to provide new observations of Jupiter's moon which could, along with insights from Holden's Earth-based studies, provide evidence that there is life on Europa.

The trailer of JP Thuminad's Kannada film 'Su From So' was released on July 15. 'Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana' fame Raj B Shetty is presenting the film under his banner Lighter Buddha Films. The film is a supernatural comedy drama set in a village backdrop, showcasing the vibrant life of the villagers—until one day, the devil arrives.

The trailer presents a third person's point of view into the lives of the villagers, with the voiceover of one of the protagonists, played by the director JP Thuminad, inviting viewers into his village. Set in the coastal Mangaluru–Udupi region of Karnataka, the trailer carries the essence of 'Kantara' and 'Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana', particularly through its dialect and depiction of local life.

 

While presenting the picturesque visuals of the location, delicious regional delicacies and the everyday life of the people, the trailer steadily introduces the audience to the lead characters—Ravi, Satish, Chandra and Ashoka, who is narrating the story. The peaceful lives of the villagers take a chilling but comedic turn when Sulochana from Someshwar (Su from Sa) starts haunting them. What follows is a hilarious chain of events that flips the entire village upside down.

'Su From So' stars Shaneel Gautham, JP Thuminad, Sandhya Arakere, Prakash K Thuminadu, Deepak Rai Panaje and Mime Ramdas, all of whom are familiar to audiences for their appearances in films helmed by Raj B Shetty, Rishab Shetty or Rakshit Shetty. The music for the film has been composed by Sumedh K, and one of its songs, 'Danks Anthem', has gone viral on social media. The film has been produced by Shashidhar Shetty Baroda, Ravi Rai Kalasa and Raj B Shetty.

A psychic has detailed what it's like to 'die' after claiming to have experienced the feeling four times.

Amie Balesky, a spiritual medium with more than three million followers on TikTok, claims to have been 'helping spirits and people since 1995' and has taken to her social media account to share her latest near-death experience, which she says occurred due to a brain infection.

At the time she 'passed over', Balesky was on the operating table with doctors and nurses 'freaking out' trying to keep her alive during a dangerous procedure on her spine - which put her body into a state of shock.

The clairvoyant remembers the experience vividly: she was laid on her side watching the heart monitor when she noticed the numbers on the screen were plummeting, at which point her experiences change drastically.

""I stopped caring about what was going on around me and the feelings I had were more 'in',"" she explained to her huge following on TikTok, noting that the room was getting quieter, despite all the commotion continuing.

""I could see it, I couldn't hear it anymore... silent. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, without any feeling, transition or anything like that, I notice that my vision or what I was seeing [was] beginning to drift to a different perspective - it was drifting up. I was looking down. All I could feel was love.

Advert

""So I only thought of two things. The first one was, 'Wow, that sucks that that's happening to my body' - I knew that it was my body. Second thing, I could feel how much love I had.

""All I wanted to do was tell my mom that I loved her. [It] was utter bliss. I could see everybody and [had] no pain. [It] was amazing.""

The next thing she experienced was that she awoke two weeks later in a hospital room, and was told that she had died.

""So for me, the transition was beautiful. For me, it was peaceful - didn't even recognize that it was happening, and all my pain, anxiety, worries, all of that was gone simply in one breath,"" she continued.

The American, who goes by '@TheBalesky' on TikTok, explained that 'when you cross over' you're either met with one of your loved ones or a guy - although she didn't go into detail about whether that said person was Jesus, which many people have underwent similar experiences believe they have met.

Having had four near-death experiences, which she believes is the reason why her 'superpower' is so 'charged', she has urged people not to fear dying as it is as benign as stubbing your toe.

""Being worried about what it's going to feel like to pass is the equivalent of being worried about if you're going to stub your toe on the coffee table again - it's going to happen, it may hurt just a second, but as soon as it's there, it's gone,"" Balesky explained.

""You keep moving on because you are eternal - you are spirit.""

Having covered several administrations, I know from my own experience that there's one common complaint among White House reporters, no matter who is president: Lack of access. Why isn't he more available? Why won't he take our questions? 

That's not true of President Trump, though. He'll stop and take questions anywhere, anytime, on any topic. Well, almost any topic.

As we discovered last week, he'll take questions on any topic but one. 

“Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?” Trump exploded to a reporter who asked about Epstein at a July 8 Cabinet meeting. “This guy's been talked about for years. … And people are still talking about this guy, this creep?”  

Trump doesn't want to talk about Epstein for a couple of reasons. For one, he'd rather brag about his “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” that recently passed. For another, he'd rather forget about a convicted sexual predator whom, years earlier, he once described to New York Magazine as a “terrific guy” and “a lot of fun to be with.” 

But people are still talking about Epstein and, to Trump's dismay, will continue talking about him. Trump's problem is that it's not Democrats who are talking about Epstein but his MAGA base, who are angry at the way they believe Trump has sold out on the Epstein scandal. 

Trump begged MAGA supporters not to waste any more time on Epstein. He's even tried to blame it all on Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. But many of his MAGA supporters aren't buying it. Why? Because, ever since his apparent suicide in a federal prison cell in August 2019, MAGA commentators, with Trump's blessing, whipped up a conspiracy that the Biden Justice Department was lying about Epstein's suicide and covering up his client list to protect the “elites” who allegedly took part in Epstein's sexual depravity — and promised that, under a Trump Department of Justice, the sordid Epstein files would be released.

In a 2023 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, for example, MAGA activist Kash Patel accused Congress of blocking the release of Epstein's purported client list “because of who's on that list.” On his own podcast, Dan Bongino repeatedly questioned the handling of the Epstein investigation. “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?” he asked in 2023. 

But now Patel is director of the FBI. Bongino is his deputy director. Pam Bondi, another Epstein conspiratorialist, is attorney general. And, after Bondi told Fox News in February that the Epstein list was “sitting on my desk right now,” the Justice Department and FBI released a joint statement that contradicted everything Patel, Bongino and others had claimed for years: There is, in fact, no evidence that Epstein was murdered or kept a client list. 

That abrupt reversal, attempting to bury the whole Epstein matter, has inflamed the president's MAGA base against Bondi and Trump himself. In effect, they now accuse him of selling out and demand Bondi's resignation.

It was the main topic of conversation at last weekend's conservative Student Action Summit in Tampa. “I don't think they're telling us the truth about Epstein,” podcaster Brandon Tatum told the assembled crowd of 7,000 student activists. Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly asked the crowd a simple question: “Who do you believe? Bondi or Bongino?”

“Bongino!” they roared in response. 

Former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon accused Trump of not being as “transparent” as he promised and urged him to name a special counsel to take over the Epstein case. And, in a post, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn warned Trump: “Please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away.”  

The irony is that Bondi is probably right. Most likely, Epstein did commit suicide and did not keep a client list. But Trump and others did such a good job of selling MAGA leaders the lies about Epstein that it's now impossible to sell them the truth. This split in the MAGA world is entirely of Trump's own making.  

Starting with the Obama birther movement, Trump has long thrived on conspiracy theories. Now he is paying the price. If there's a lesson to be learned, it's this: Be careful of the monsters you create with your conspiracy theories, because they might come back to haunt you — which is exactly what Epstein is doing to Trump now.

Gabe Torres lining up a shot on the set of the movie ""Brake"" in 2010. 

Reporting intern





A 1986 mystery by a Cayuga County native returned to the big screen last weekend before a crowd on the shores of Cayuga Lake.

“The Legend of Firefly Marsh,” directed by Gabe Torres, of Aurora, tells the story of a legendary lake monster. Many such stories have emerged from his hometown since the 1800s, which is why the short film was selected to lead off the 51st annual AuroraFest village celebration, whose theme was ""mystical lake creatures."" 

Shot both locally and in California, the film features many local names and settings. Torres, who now lives in Los Angeles, joined the screening to answer questions via Zoom. 

While local and national audiences have been familiar with the mystery films of Torres for decades, in recent years his work has been seen in much greater numbers thanks to ""Unsolved Mysteries"" on Netflix. After directing episodes of the documentary series in the early 2000s, Torres returned for the popular reboot, which has reached No. 1 on the streamer's most-watched list.

In the wake of that success, and his screening of ""Firefly Marsh"" in Aurora, The Citizen caught up with Torres to talk more about his past, present and future projects. 

A depiction of the Mothman —  a cryptid that some believe lives in Point Pleasant, West Virginia —  on the set of Gabe Torres' ""Unsolved Mysteries.""

When The Citizen spoke to Torres at around 7:30 a.m. Pacific time, he was already at work.

The Aurora native was brokering phone and video calls for his latest project, a documentary drama about different factions hunting for the fabled cryptid Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. 

It's familiar territory after ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" for which Torres directed five episodes in 2022 and 2024.

“One day they called and asked if I wanted to do it again,” he told The Citizen. “They said, 'We're bringing it to a new generation, and upping the production value.'” 

Torres' episodes cover some well-known topics, such as Bigfoot's West Virginian cousin, the Mothman, and the discovery of what some believe to be UFO debris in Roswell, New Mexico. 

However, much to Torres' pleasure, he got to cover lesser-known stories as well.

“The dream of it is to find the story that has not been told,” Torres said. 

One new episode that stuck out to Torres was “The Body in the Basement.” 

It covers the story of a bloody, unsolved murder in Calgary — a true story that Torres, holding his tongue to prevent spoilers, said is unraveled in reverse order. 

Another, “Something in the Sky,” chronicles the aftermath of mass UFO sightings over Lake Michigan in the 1990s. 

To Torres, that pair of episodes was a welcome break from business as usual in modern television, reminding him of when he was first starting decades ago.





“In the Netflix era, the streaming execs want us to explore stories that would drive their algorithms more,” he said, noting frequent pitches from them about Jack the Ripper, Roswell and the Mothman.

""In the old days, we would just pick the best mystery.” 

Still, the streamer decided not to renew the series after its fifth volume came out in October 2024. It's now being shopped to other platforms. 

Torres said he's appreciative the series gave him the chance to direct mysteries again, and hopes it finds a home somewhere else. 

“To bring something to an audience where no one knows what happens — that's much more gratifying, and much more fun,” he said.

While Torres likes making documentaries, he called it his “day job.” 

His true passion, he said, is making films — and his voice brightened as he started talking about two he is currently working on.

He just finished the script for one of them, a horror film called “Dragon Fall,” and is now looking for a teenage lead actor who can help sell it. 

The other, “Nothing to Lose,” has already been picked up by production company Dolphin Entertainment and is set to begin shooting in Nashville after it casts its lead actors. 

Torres' passion for filmmaking started young, at age 12. After watching films like “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” he became fascinated with how they looked. 

“It was really films like that had a lot of action and visual elements that would get me asking, ‘How did they do that?' and, ‘How did they make it look like that?'” he said. 

He lucked into finding a Kodak Super 8 film camera at his neighbor's house and set out making disaster shorts, like sinking ships and collapsing dams. 

“It wasn't until my senior year that I focused on stories rather than special effects,” Torres said, “and that's where my passion lies now.” 

As Torres continues to add new projects and credits to his resume, people still contact him about ""Firefly Marsh"" as well.

Just last month, he said, a fan from the United Kingdom who used to watch it on the Disney Channel reached out in hopes of getting a copy, which Torres provided.

“There's all these kids that grew up in the '90s that loved everything,” he said. “It's always great to have your work, that you pour so much into, get recognized.”

A lot has changed in Hollywood since Torres got his start, like the meteoric rise of streaming. But he still clings to old-school habits — all his scripts find life on yellow legal pads, and physical copies of films and vinyl soundtracks still line his shelves. He'll also never stop tapping into the childhood magic that made films so special for him growing up.

“I think 'Firefly Marsh' is a throwback to the magic of childhood, when you believe in myths and in monsters,” he said. “Everything is possible, if you believe.”

      Date/Time: 07/12/2025 at 9:31 PM EST. Location: Lansing, MI Duration: ~5 second - 10 seconds Shape: Teardrop / Bell-shaped / Unknown Number of objects: 1 Color: Dark silhouette Lighting Conditions: Sunset Sound: No sound Motion: Hovering or stationary, then sudden disappearance Weather: Clear and very little wind
    


      Facing North/NorthWest Approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon. Approximately 215 feet from me horizontally.
    


      I was outside around sunset when I noticed a large, dark object in the sky. It was bell-shaped or possibly teardrop-shaped, hovering silently above the horizon. The shape of the flying object was something I have personally never seen before. It looked solid and symmetrical, with no visible lights, no blinking indicators, and no sound — just a jet black silhouette against the colorful sky.
    


      At first, I thought it might be a cluster of balloons or maybe a drone, but it felt too big and still for either. The object remained completely motionless for about 5 seconds, and then — without warning — it disappeared. It didn't drift away, fly off, or shrink into the distance. It just vanished.
    


      I have accumulated hours of experience around drones from personally operating drones to watching and learning from others operating. This was something much larger than a standard drone that me, you, or the neighbor could get ahold of.
    


      There were no aircraft in the area, and the skies were otherwise clear. It wasn't windy, and I didn't hear any drones or buzzing sounds. It didn't behave like anything I've seen before, and I haven't been able to come up with a solid explanation since.
    


      I've honestly never really looked into UFO's or drones prior to last Saturday. I knew the pentagon released information confirming an influx of drones/unidentifiable flying objects from social media but now I can't stop looking into all of the facts that we as humans know - specifically information coming from renowned scientists, the US military, government, and prior individuals in authority. I don't know honestly, I'm at a lost and just looking for a solid explanation because the only thing I can land on is “UFO”. Open to hearing and discussing all options!

MOSCOW, July 15. /TASS/. Moscow will not be dictated to, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS, commenting on recent statements by US President Donald Trump.

""Certainly, above all, we note that any attempts to put forth demands or, moreover, ultimatums, are unacceptable to us,"" the senior Russian diplomat pointed out.

He emphasized that Moscow favors a diplomatic resolution of the Ukraine conflict and is ready to negotiate. ""It is necessary to focus on political and diplomatic work. The president of the Russian Federation has repeatedly said that we are ready to negotiate and that the diplomatic path is the one we prefer,"" Ryabkov noted.

""However, if this is not met with a proper response, if we cannot reach our set goals through diplomacy, then the special military operation will go on,"" the Russian deputy foreign minister cautioned.

Moscow is ""unshakable"" in this stance, he highlighted. ""We would like for Washington and NATO in general to treat it with the utmost seriousness,"" Ryabkov said.

In his assessment, Trump's recent statements ""fit in with the general line we have been seeing from the US side lately.""

On July 14, Trump made a scheduled statement on the Ukrainian settlement. In the presence of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the US leader said that he was ""disappointed"" in Russia and its president as well as announced his decision to continue supplying weapons and military hardware to the Kiev regime if Europe foots the bill with NATO coordination.

Additionally, Trump said that the US will impose about 100% import tariffs on Russia and its trade partners if within 50 days Moscow and Washington do not reach an agreement on the Ukrainian settlement.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The 76-year-old former SCTV star Dave Thomas recently spoke to The Globe and Mail about his trip to Ukraine.Dave Thomas/The Canadian Press

Comedian Dave Thomas recently returned from a 10-day trip to Ukraine to raise awareness for the Ukrainian Freedom Fund, a charity that supplies non-lethal equipment and training to Ukrainians. The 76-year-old former SCTV star recently spoke to The Globe and Mail by video conference from Los Angeles. 

How does one get to Kyiv in the middle of a war?

You can't fly to Ukraine. I took a Turkish Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, which took 14 hours. And then I took a connecting flight to Chisinau, Moldova, south of Ukraine. From there was an eight-hour ride with an army security official through Ukraine. It was a pretty hairy ride.

Were you in danger? 

Dave Thomas poses with a flag on his goodwill trip to Ukraine.The Globe and Mail

We were dodging automobile debris on the road, from previous drone strikes. We had to travel at night because the strikes were during the day. I later met a communications officer who said his personal car was attacked when he was off duty. They were stalking him because he was a valuable piece in the military command chain. The Russians use social media and all sorts of tracking methods. It's a different kind of war going on. 

What was Kyiv like?

We got there in the morning. It looked like a normal European city − business as usual. People sat in cafes drinking lattes. Students were lined up outside the university. During the day, it was difficult for me to imagine there was a war going on. But at night, that's when you know. Explosions rocked my hotel.

Do you meet any Canadians over there?

I did, a retired Canadian general acting as an adviser. There are more than a million Ukrainians in Canada. This general felt he was doing the right thing by them. There's a sense of obligation to them, as taxpaying citizens. 

You're a comedian with no Ukrainian heritage in your background. What about your own sense of responsibility that led your there?

I'm 76 years old. I feel I have to do something with my life before I die that has some value. I've made some people laugh. I guess that's great. But I felt I should do something more.

Former SCTV star Dave Thomas goes to Ukraine: ‘Most of my career is behind me, so why don't I go over there and see what I can do?'

What do you think you accomplished?

I learned a lot about people. Maybe there will be an increase in donations in Canada, which would be great. They're giving medical supplies and teaching field triage. They have evacuation teams that go behind enemy lines to rescue Ukrainian people who are trapped there, including women and children. 

Did you accompany those teams?

I did. The Russians were shooting at us. 

On SCTV, you portrayed Bob Hope, famous for entertaining troops abroad. I wonder if he ever got shot at.

I don't know. But drones are the weapons of choice now. Ukrainian soldiers told me how difficult they are to shoot down. They're almost like those model airplanes hobbyists fly. I saw one Russian drone hanging in a bar. It doesn't look threatening at all, and yet they carry ordnance. 

Did you talk to wounded soldiers?

Yes. The communications officer I mentioned lost his legs. He said to me, ‘They blew up the wrong half of me.' He's still good from the legs up. ‘I'm still fighting,' he said. 

What about the civilians you spoke with?

I talked to a woman who was being evacuated from the south, near Odessa. Her husband was packing the car, and a Russian sniper shot him in the head. She saw it happen from the window of her house. She fled with her children on her own. Nobody should have to witness that.

Did you speak with people about President Trump and U.S. support?

They're very careful not to say anything negative about the United States. There's a Ukrainian phrase that translates to, ‘Everything will be fine.' There's a song that everybody knows that talks to this spirit of resilience. I saw that resilience myself.

In what form?

I heard about drone strikes on a mall in Kyiv. It happened around midnight. When I went to the mall the next morning, the store owners had replaced the glass that had been destroyed by the blast. Cardboard replaced the walls, and they were open for business as usual. I have to admit, I was mad at myself for being disappointed, because I brought my video crew to shoot the devastation and it was already under repair. They're dedicated to making things appear normal.

You had plans to visit comedy clubs. Did you?

Yes. I spoke with stand-ups. I wanted to know what Ukrainians were laughing at. What I found was that it wasn't Trump or Putin or political jokes. It's dating, lifestyle stuff. They want to laugh at normal things. The war is off topic. Nobody thinks the war is funny − there's nothing funny about it.

            The world's oldest marathon runner, Fauja Singh, who was still competing after turning 100 more than a decade ago, died in a hit-and-run on Monday, according to India police. He was 114.
    


            Born in rural India in 1911 before later moving to London, Singh earned the nickname  “Turbaned Tornado” after he took up marathon running in his late 80s. He went on to complete nine of the 26.2-mile races.
    


            He was considered the world's oldest marathon runner, though never secured a Guinness World Record because he didn't have a birth certificate.
    


            According to Indian police, an unknown vehicle hit Singh when he was walking on a road near his native village of Beas, in the north-western Indian state of Punjab.
    


            He was sent to the Srimann Hospital in Jalandhar district where he succumbed to injuries sustained to his head and ribs, Jalandhar Rural Senior Superintendent of Police Harvinder Singh Virk said.
    


            “We are working on identifying the vehicle. We are using CCTV footage in the area to trace the vehicle and have dispatched teams that are working on it,” the superintendent told CNN, adding that a passerby witnessed the accident.
    


            India Prime Minister Narendra Modi led nationwide tributes, calling Singh “an exceptional athlete with incredible determination.”
    


            Singh only started running marathons when he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son.
    


            “Running showed me kindness and brought me back to life by making me forget all my traumas and sorrows,” he told CNN in an interview when he was 102.
    


            He ran his first marathon after just a couple of months of training, and achieved his personal best of five hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon three years later.
    


            In 2011, Singh returned to Toronto, where he became the first centenarian on record to complete a marathon, finishing in eight hours and 11 minutes and six seconds.
    


            It was a far cry from his humble childhood in India, when he was unable to walk until he was five due to weakness in his legs.
    


            His last race was in Hong Kong, a 10-kilometer route, in 2013, a year after he carried the torch for the 2012 London Olympics.
    


            Despite his success, his achievements were never accepted by Guinness World Records' rule-keepers due to his lack of a birth certificate. He did however, receive a letter from Britain's Queen Elizabeth congratulating him on his 100th birthday.
    


            “I am very fond of my running shoes, I absolutely love them. I wear them for pleasure. I can't imagine my life without them,” he told CNN, when he was 102.

US President Donald Trump is considering allowing Ukraine to launch long-range strikes into Russia using US-made ATACMS missiles, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing sources.

According to the outlet, Trump could permit Ukraine to use the 18 ATACMS launchers that have already been delivered to fire at their full range of 300km. A source involved in the discussions told the Post that the decision would also likely include providing Kiev with additional ATACMS munitions.

While ATACMS would not reach Moscow or St. Petersburg, they would allow Ukraine to strike military bases, airfields, and supply depots deep inside Russia that are currently out of range, the Post said. The report also noted that Pentagon officials have for months pushed for deeper strikes into Russia to undermine its military. The report follows Trump's 50-day ultimatum to Moscow in which he threatened to impose “severe” secondary tariffs of up to 100% on Russia's trade partners if no progress towards peace is made.



Ukraine was first allowed to use US-supplied long-range missiles against targets deep inside Russia by the Biden administration in the autumn of 2024, although reportedly under geographic restrictions. By January, however, Ukrainian forces had largely exhausted the stocks of ATACMS provided by Washington during heavy fighting with Russian forces, according to an AP report at the time.

In some cases Ukraine has used ATACMS to strike civilian targets inside Russian territory. In the most widely covered incident last June, missile fragments fell on a beach in Crimea, killing four civilians and injuring more than 150.

The Post also reported that Trump had a phone call with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky last week, during which the US president wondered why Ukraine had not targeted Moscow. However, the White House insisted in a statement to the outlet that the comments should not be taken out of context.

Commenting on the report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “as a rule, all of this usually turns out to be fake,” adding that “sometimes there are indeed serious leaks, even in publications we once considered quite respectable.”

LONDON, July 15. /TASS/. Melania Trump could have significantly influenced US President Donald Trump's decision to supply Ukraine with interceptor missiles for Patriot complexes, The Times quoted Mary Jordan, who authored a book about the first lady, as saying.

""Trump listens to certain people on certain things,"" says Jordan. ""He particularly listens to people who are really close to him. And especially if their last name is Trump.""

As The Times points out, despite the large number of national security advisers and foreign policy analysts in the White House, it is the wife of the US president whose opinion may be the most significant.

On July 14, Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev, if Europe would pay for such supplies. Coordination was laid on NATO.

CNN reported that besides the Patriot complexes, the United States may also transfer short-range missiles and howitzer ammunition to NATO countries for a subsequent shipment to Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Protests this month laid bare the growing anger from locals against foreigners who have flocked to the Mexican capital since the coronavirus pandemic

The protesters tore through the city chanting angry slogans and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake: shattered glass, broken doors and furious graffiti – “get out of Mexico.”

Some, dressed in black, smashed windows of local businesses. Others marched peacefully but carried signs with angry messages: “You're a colonizer not a fucking ‘expat'”; “Gringo go home.”

The march, which took place in central Mexico City earlier this month, was an angry local response against a growing global phenomenon: Gentrification, which locals blame on foreigners who have flocked to the capital since the coronavirus pandemic.

Residents of the capital say these so-called ‘digital nomads' are taking advantage of Mexico's relatively cheap living standards but pricing out locals in the process.

Making matters worse: a flood of Airbnbs have overtaken the metropolis' most desirable, central neighborhoods (more than 26,000 listings according to the Inside Airbnb advocacy group), replacing longtime residents with tourists and short-term renters.

It is a trend that's been echoed around the world, in cites like Barcelona, Genoa and Lisbon, where tourist apartments have proliferated, turning long-term residents into a rarity and causing anger among locals who have seen their communities eroded.

The protest prompted a sharp rebuke from the country's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. “The xenophobic displays at this demonstration must be condemned,” she said during a daily news conference last week. “No matter how legitimate the demand, in this case gentrification, we can't just say ‘Out!' to any nationality in our country.”

But many Mexicans were sympathetic to the marchers' anger. Watching the protest play out on social media from his mother's home in the nearby city of Puebla, where he was forced to move after being priced out of Mexico City, Daniel Benavides says all he could think was: “Hell yeah!”

A 35-year-old film editor, Benavides moved to the Roma Sur neighborhood in central Mexico City in 2016. Unlike the already trendy Roma Norte and Condesa, Roma Sur still felt like a quiet neighborhood, without the hip bars, restaurants and Airbnbs that had flooded other areas. It was also affordable.

But slowly, things started to change. There was already one Starbucks – then another one appeared, followed by the American fast food restaurant Popeyes. Then came the quaint cafes and bars that all looked the same.

“They all had little incandescent lightbulbs held up by rope,” he said.

Benavides also started to notice an influx of foreigners, mostly Americans.

Soon, the rent for his apartment started to go up. First the landlord increased the apartment's monthly rent by 3000 pesos (£118) from one year to the next. Then he started increasing it by about 8% annually. Before long it had gone from 15,500 to 20,500 pesos per month (£613 to £810).

Such an increase is relatively modest, particularly by Mexico City standards. Yahir Zavaleta, 40, was living in Roma Norte in 2012, when it was still filled with locally owned businesses and cafes. When his contract came up for renewal in 2014, the rental company wanted to nearly double the rent. Zavaleta and his roommate decided to leave.

Cecilia Portillo, a 30-year-old designer, has lived in Condesa for three years. Recently, she told her landlady that she was moving out, but that a friend was ready to take her place.

“The rent is going to go up by 50%,” said the landlady, according to Portillo, who has also watched a flood of foreigners arrive in her building. “We've seen that people are willing to pay that much.”

Such dramatic price rises, particularly in desirable, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, are common in Mexico City. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2024 found that, over a 20 year period, average housing prices in the Mexican capital had quadrupled, without considering inflation. In the swanky neighborhood of Polanco, prices increased eightfold between 2000 and 2018.

Yet the study's authors cautioned that “the influx of digital nomads, which significantly increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, does not appear to significantly impact the dynamics of housing access” noting that it “may be too early to observe the full impact of these newcomers”.

Instead, the study suggested that “displacement and gentrification predominantly originate from government policies and politics.” According to Mexico's national statistics agency, Mexico City had the lowest rate of new housing built between 2010 and 2020 of any state in the country.

“Housing construction has practically stopped completely in the last seven years,” said Adrián Acevedo, an urban planner and housing specialist. “If there is no housing, then the purchasing power of those few people [who can afford to live in desirable areas], whether it be a foreigner or an upper-class Mexican, will obviously push up the price of the few homes that are available.”

The lack of new housing, and the resulting surge in prices, leaves many lower-income residents with nowhere to go: According to state figures, 23,000 families leave Mexico per year.

In 2022, Benavides' landlord announced that he had sold the apartment to a French woman: Benavides and his roommates would have to move out. He managed to find a shabby place nearby for 14,500 (£574) a month where he lived for a year. But then the landlord said they were increasing the monthly rent by 500 pesos, and Benavides also found himself without a job.

Benavides decided to move out but suddenly found that rental prices in his neighborhood had skyrocketed up to 25, 35, 40 even 100,000 pesos a month. His old place now seemed like a bargain. With no job prospects and rents unaffordable, Benavides decided to leave Mexico City and move back in with his mother.

“I pushed the emergency eject button,” he said woefully, adding that, particularly as a gay man, he still misses the capital. “It's a beacon of hope – a place you can be free.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Nvidia Corp chief executive officer Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) late on Monday said the technology giant has won approval from US President Donald Trump's administration to sell its advanced H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) used to develop artificial intelligence (AI) to China.

The news came in a company blog post late on Monday and Huang also spoke about the coup on China's state-run China Global Television Network in remarks shown on X.

“The US government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,” the post said.

“Today, I'm announcing that the US government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing.

He said that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.

“It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,” he said.

Huang recently met with Trump and other US policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials.

Huang's visit is being closely watched in Beijing and Washington, where a bipartisan pair of senators last week sent the CEO a letter asking him to abstain from meeting companies working with military or intelligence bodies.

Nvidia has profited enormously from the rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass US$4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the US and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.

Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. 

The White House in April announced that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 GPUs and Advanced Micro Devices Inc's MI308 chips to China, following the emergence of China's DeepSeek (深度求索) AI chatbot in January.

Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra US$5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Trump to reverse the restrictions. They said that such limits hinder US competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world's largest markets for technology.

They have also warned that US export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China's AI technology.

As Nvidia said it planned to resume sales of H20s to China, Chinese companies have scrambled to place orders for the GPUs, which Nvidia would then need to send to the US government for approval, the sources familiar with the matter said.

They added that Internet giants ByteDance Ltd (字節跳動) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (騰訊) are in the process of submitting applications.

Central to the process is a “whitelist” put together by Nvidia for Chinese companies to register for potential purchases, one of the sources said.

Separately, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) said yesterday that it plans to restart shipments of its MI308 chips to China after the US said it would approve the sales.

The US commerce department told AMD that license applications for the MI308 products would move forward for review, an AMD spokesman said.

AMD said in April that export restrictions on the MI308 chips would cost the company about US$800 million.

Details of what the two men discussed were not immediately available, and the people familiar with the meeting declined to elaborate on the agenda. 
Spokespeople for the White House had no immediate comment.

Fauja Singh, an Indian-born runner nicknamed the Turbaned Torpedo who was believed to be the world's oldest marathon runner, has died after being hit by a car. He was 114.

Local media in India reported that Singh sustained severe head injuries in a hit-and-run accident on Monday while he was crossing the road at his native village near Jalandhar in Punjab. He was taken to the hospital where he later died. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs In The City, confirmed his death.

India's Prime minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh, saying he was “extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness.”

Singh became the oldest man to run a full marathon in 2011 at the age of 100 in Toronto. His accomplishment was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he did not have a birth certificate to prove his age. Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911.

A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on him because of its grisly nature.

Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father's eyes.

Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left all alone.

“He didn't think his life was worth living without his son” following the traumatic incident, his coach Harmander Singh said.

He went to live with his youngest son in London. That's where sports enthusiast Singh attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community and took part in sprints. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided that's what he wanted to do.

At the age of 89 in 2000 he ran the London Marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Marathon.

“From a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,” Singh said.

Singh ran his last competitive race in 2013 at the age of 101, finishing the Hong Kong Marathon's 10-kilometre (6.25-mile) race in 1 hour, 32 minutes, 28 seconds.

Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped “people will remember me and not forget me.” He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events “rather than forget me altogether just because I don't run anymore.”

“He was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination,” Modi said. “Pained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and countless admirers around the world.”

A prisoner escaped from a French jail after he fit himself into a bag carried out by his fellow inmate, who was released last week. Authorities have now arrested the escapee. 

A man who escaped from a French prison last week was recaptured early Monday morning, according to France's public prosecutor.

The man broke out of prison by hiding in a bag carried out by a fellow inmate released last week.

The 20-year-old escaped from Lyon-Corbas prison in southeast France and was recaptured after an extensive investigation.

According to French television channel BFMTV, the escapee was arrested at around 6 a.m. local time (0400 UTC/GMT), as he left a cellar in Sathonay-Camp, a commune on the outskirts of Lyon, in southern France.

The prosecutor's office said in the that statement his accomplice had not been found or arrested yet, noting that nobody had been injured during the operation this morning.

Local media reported that the escapee was serving at least two prison sentences and was under investigation for organized crime.

According to Le Parisien newspaper, the man who was set to be released asked prison staff for a trolley to carry bags out of the prison to his car.

The inmate, according to the report, escaped in a large laundry bag that was among the belongings carried out. 

Sebastien Cauwel, the director of France's prison administration, told BFMTV last week that the escape was extremely rare.

""This is an extremely rare event that we have never experienced in this administration and which clearly reveals a whole series of serious dysfunctions,"" he said Saturday.

Cauwel said he launched an internal investigation as soon as he was aware of the situation, which came to light 24 hours after the man escaped.

""This facility has an occupancy rate of 170%. This clearly makes working conditions more difficult for our staff,"" Cauwel noted.

""What this incident reveals is rather an accumulation of material errors, possibly faults, which the investigation will bring to light,"" he said.

Two people have been killed after flash flooding hit New Jersey and New York, as parts of the northeastern US braced for more harsh weather.

Torrential rain lashed the area on Monday night, with a flash flood warning issued for all five boroughs of New York City and a state of emergency declared in New Jersey.

Two people died in the state when their vehicle was swept into a river, with emergency responders at the scene unable to save them, local officials said.

Phil Murphy, the state's governor, urged residents to “stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel”.

In New York, flash floods shut down subway lines and left vehicles stranded, while footage shared on social media showed water surging into underground stations.

More than two inches of rain fell in a single hour in the city.

In downtown Manhattan, dozens of passengers were reportedly left trapped on a train as water poured into the 28th street station.

One video showed a platform completely flooded, with passengers climbing onto train seats to escape the rising water.

City officials urged residents to steer clear of flood-prone areas. “If you live in a basement apartment or low-lying area, be ready to move to higher ground,” New York City Emergency Management said.

On Monday, weather watches and warnings were in place across surrounding areas including Baltimore, Newark, New Jersey, and Arlington, Virginia.

Flash flooding was also reported in Bergen and Union counties, where the National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening” conditions.

On Staten Island, railway services were suspended in both directions due to flooding.

A flood warning was issued for the area which had recorded about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 centimetres) of rain, according to New York City's emergency notification system.

At least one water rescue operation was under way in Westchester County, north of New York City.

“At this time, residents are still strongly advised to avoid all travel unless fleeing an area that is subject to flooding, or under an evacuation order,” said Carolyn Fortino, a spokesperson for the county executive.

A flood warning remained in effect until Tuesday morning for parts of New Jersey, while the slow-moving summer storm was expected to continue showering the Mid-Atlantic region into the middle of the week.

The National Weather Service forecasted that New York City would remain mainly dry after the initial rainfall on Monday night. “However, a few isolated showers or a thunderstorm is possible this afternoon and evening,” they added.

Airports across the East Coast also faced widespread disruption. A total of 1,966 flights were cancelled and more than 10,000 were delayed.

Ground stops were issued at LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports, while John F Kennedy Airport warned of widespread delays.

United Airlines, which has a hub at Newark, said: “Severe weather conditions are impacting operations at Newark Liberty with a ground stop issued to manage volume and limit congestion.”

Follow:


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that last week's memo declining to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “speaks for itself,” rejecting questions about making more documents public.
    


            “Today our memo speaks for itself, and we will get back to you about anything else,” Bondi told reporters Tuesday, responding to questions about President Donald Trump's earlier comment that Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible.”
    


            At the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he stood behind Bondi, responding to a question about his daughter-in-law Lara Trump saying that there needs to be “more transparency” around the Epstein investigation.
    


            “The attorney general has handled that very well … really done a very good job,” Trump said.
    


            “I would like to see that also,” the president added, in an apparent reference to the call for more transparency. “But I think the attorney general — the credibility is very important, and you want credible evidence for something like that, and I think the attorney general's handled it very well.”
    


            Additionally, Trump said Bondi has not told him that his name appears in the Epstein files, despite previous accusations from ex-Trump ally Elon Musk.
    


            “No, no, she's given just a very quick briefing,” Trump told reporters.
    


            Bondi's comments came during a press conference at the Drug Enforcement Agency, highlighting law enforcement seizures of 64,000 pounds of methamphetamines — including those in pill form — in drug busts since January. Several happened over the July 4th holiday weekend.
    


            Though the surge in drugs like meth-laced pills is a national threat — and drug cases are of particular importance to the attorney general — it was not enough to divert attention from the Epstein controversy.
    


            The department is keen to change the current conversation around Epstein, sources tell CNN, and is prioritizing putting Bondi in front of cameras to discuss other Trump priorities like the drug busts discussed Tuesday. Their hope is that the controversy will die down despite the enormous amount of backlash the department is facing from Trump's own supporters.
    


            That was evident during the event Tuesday, as reporters repeatedly asked about additional disclosures, as well as her relationship with FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Bondi repeatedly said she would not answer questions on the matter.
    


            Bondi said that she, Patel and Bongino are “all committed” to “fighting as a team” to accomplish Trump administration priorities like reducing violent crime.
    


            “I'm going to be here as long as the president wants me here, and I believe he's made that crystal clear it's four years,” Bondi said of the drama and subsequent calls for her resignation.
    


            “Well, three and a half now, right?” she said.
    


            Trump was also asked at the White House if he has faith in Bongino, who CNN has reported has clashed with Bondi over the release of files related to the Epstein investigation.
    


            “I like Dan Bongino,” Trump said.

Some pitchers aren't exactly thrilled","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/sport/mlb-all-star-game-balls-and-strikes-spt","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:59:00 GMT","


            The hottest topic in Atlanta ahead of Tuesday's Major League Baseball All-Star Game isn't a player, a coach or a manager.
    


            It's not even human.
    


            For the first time, the midsummer classic is going to be using automated technology to allow pitchers, catchers and batters to challenge balls and strikes – a system that's been in use in the minor leagues and in spring training but had never been put in place before at a major league park.
    


            It's a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the game, a system that might forever change one of the ficklest parts of an incredibly fickle game: The ever-changing, unpredictable strike zone put in place by all-too-human home plate umpires.
    


            Pitchers are largely unfazed – at least before the game gets going.
    


            “I don't plan on using them. I'm probably not going to use them in the future. I'm gonna let the catcher do that,” said Tarik Skubal, the Detroit Tigers star who will start the game for the American League. “I have this thing where I think everything's a strike until the umpire calls it a ball.”
    


            Paul Skenes, the Pittsburgh Pirates fireballer who will start for the National League, felt much the same way.
    


            “Pitchers think that everything's a strike, then you go back and look at it and it's two, three balls off,” he said Monday. “So, we should not be the ones that are challenging it. I really do like the human element of the game. I think this is one of those things that you kind of think that umpires are great until they're not, and so I could kind of care less either way, to be honest.”
    


            According to MLB, the challenge system will have the same rules as were used in spring training: Each team starts the game with two challenges and they keep their challenge if they are deemed correct. Only the pitcher, catcher and hitter can challenge a call and the system is put into place when one of those players taps the top of his cap or helmet twice.
    


            The system was in place during the Futures Game at Truist Park on Saturday between some of the game's top minor league prospect. When a player would challenge a call, the game would pause, and attention would turn to the stadium's massive screen beyond right center field.
    


            A virtual simulation of the pitch would be shown along with a strike zone and the technology would rule if the ball fell within or outside the box. Play would then resume after the short break.
    


            It's unclear exactly how the league will determine the size of those strike zones for each batter, and that's something Los Angeles Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw wants to know.
    


            “I did a few rehab starts with it. I'm OK with it, you know, I think, I mean, it works,” he told reporters on Monday. “I just don't really understand how they're doing the box for the hitter, because I think every different TV or national streaming service has their own box. I think I just hope that they figure out, because Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes, so … know they've obviously thought about that. I haven't talked to MLB about it, but as long as that gets figured out, I think it'd be fun.”
    


            The phrase used most on Monday when discussing the technology was an iconic one in baseball lore: The “human element.”
    


            It's one of the things that can make baseball so perfectly imperfect – the ability of umpires to simply get it wrong and make a massive impact on the game. From Jim Joyce ruling a batter safe to ruin Armando Galarraga's perfect game bid to Don Dekinger's World Series-changing call in 1985, ruling Kansas City Royals player Jorge Orta was safe at first base even though replays showed he was out by a step. Instead of being the last out of a St. Louis Cardinals World Series championship, the moment became the spark for the Royals to charge back and win the title.
    


            The “human element” is one of baseball's quirks that give the nation's pastime its identity. But it's also something that many fans would rather see cast off into obscurity.
    


            Chris Sale, the Atlanta Braves pitcher and reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, said he still wants it to be part of the game.
    


            “Honestly, for me, I kind of like the human element, right? Like I understand why they want to use ABS. And I don't think it's a perfect system yet,” he said. “I kind of like the old feel, the old way of doing it.”

Follow:


            Relatives of an Indian nurse on death row in war-torn Yemen are racing against time to commute her death sentence, in a case that has gripped India's media.
    


            Nimisha Priya was sentenced to death for the murder of her former business partner, a Yemeni national, whose body was discovered in a water tank in 2017.
    


            Her execution was initially scheduled for Wednesday, but Indian government sources said on Tuesday she had been given a last minute reprieve.
    


            She was given the death penalty by a court in capital Sanaa in 2020 and her family has been fighting for her release since, complicated by the lack of formal ties between New Delhi and the Houthis, who have controlled the city since the country's civil war broke out in 2014.
    


            India's media has devoted significant coverage to the case and human rights groups have called on the Houthis not to carry it out.
    


            Amnesty International on Monday urged the Houthis to “establish a moratorium on all executions and commute (Priya's) and all existing death sentences as first steps.”
    


            It added: “The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.”
    


            Priya's mother Prema Kumari, a domestic laborer from Kerala, who sold her home to fund her daughter's legal fees, has been in Yemen for more than one year to facilitate negotiations for her release.
    


            She last saw Priya on June 18, she told CNN. “She looked tense,” Kumar said through tears.
    


            In accordance with Yemen's Islamic laws, Priya could be given clemency if the victim's family pardon her and accept her family's donation of “diyah”, often dubbed blood money, according to Samuel Joseph, a social worker assisting her family in the case.
    


            “I am optimistic,” said Joseph, an Indian who has lived in Yemen since 1999.
    


            “I'm spiriting the efforts here, and by god's grace, we got people who are helping. The government of India is directly involved and there's nothing more I can say at this point of time,” he told CNN.
    


            The Indian government sources said Tuesday the government has “made concerted efforts in recent days to seek more time for the family of Ms. Nimishapriya to reach a mutually agreeable solution with the other party.”
    


            “Despite the sensitivities involved, Indian officials have been in regular touch with the local jail authorities and the prosecutor's office, leading to securing this postponement.”
    


            Priya allegedly injected her business partner with a fatal overdose of sedatives, Joseph said. Her family maintain she was acting in self-defense and that her business partner was abusive and kept her passport from her after the country's civil war broke out.
    


            Her trial was held in Arabic and she was not provided with a translator, Joseph said.
    


            A group of activists and lawyers founded the Save Nimisha Priya Action Council in 2020 to raise money for Priya's release and negotiate with the victim's family.
    


            “Negotiations have been a challenge,” said Rafeek Ravuthar, an activist and member of the council. “The reality is that there is no Indian embassy, there is no mission in this country.”
    


            Rafeeq said about five million rupees (nearly $58,000) has been raised so far.
    


            In recent days, politicians from her home state of Kerala have requested India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and help secure Priya's release.
    


            “Considering the fact this is a case deserving sympathy, I appeal to the Hon'ble Prime Minister to take up the matter,” Kerala's chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote in a letter to Modi.
    


            In February, Kirti Vardhan Singh, India's Minister of State for External Affairs told the upper house of parliament that the government “accords the highest priority for the welfare of Indians abroad and provides all possible support to those who fall in distress including in the instant case.”
    


            He added: “Government of India is providing all possible assistance in the case. The matter regarding any consideration towards the release of Ms. Nimisha Priya is between the family of the deceased and Ms. Nimisha Priya's family.”
    


            CNN has contacted India's foreign ministry for comment.
    


            Priya first arrived in Yemen in 2008, joining the ranks of more than two million people from Kerala who have sought better livelihoods across the Middle East.
    


            She found work as a nurse in a local hospital, nurturing hopes of establishing her own clinic and building a more secure future for her young daughter and husband, according to campaigners from the Save Nimisha Priya Council. Yemeni regulations, however, required foreign nationals to partner with a local to open a business.
    


            With the support of her husband, Priya borrowed from family and friends and in 2014 opened a clinic in Sanaa.
    


            “We lived a normal happy married life,” her husband Tomy Thomas told CNN. “My wife was very loving, hardworking and faithful in all that she did.”
    


            But her aspirations were soon overshadowed by the political conflict and turmoil that has beset Yemen for decades.
    


            That same year, Houthi rebels seized the capital, ousting the internationally recognized Saudi-backed government. By 2015, the unrest had escalated into a devastating civil war, leaving the country fractured and unstable.
    


            For foreign nationals, the deteriorating security situation made Yemen an increasingly perilous place to live and work. Many chose to evacuate, but Priya decided to remain. Those supporting her family say that she stayed on, determined to salvage the life and business she had worked hard to build.
    


            India does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with the Houthis, nor does it have an operational embassy in Yemen. All consular and diplomatic affairs related to the country are instead handled through the Indian Embassy in Djibouti, across the Red Sea.
    


            CNN has contacted the Indian embassy in Djibouti.
    


            For those working to save Priya, that meant navigating complex communication channels and facing additional hurdles in seeking help, legal aid, or protection while stranded in a nation still wracked by conflict and instability.
    


            Yemen was among the top five countries in 2024 with the highest number of executions, according to Amnesty International.
    


            Amnesty said it confirmed the Houthis carried out at least one execution in areas they control in 2024 but added that it was possible more took place.
    


            Priya's mother, Kumari, said she was “grateful for everyone's support,” adding she is happy has been able to see Priya over the course of this year.
    


            Priya's husband and daughter remain in Kerala, hopeful for her release.
    


            “My wife is very good, she is very loving,” Thomas said. “That is the sole reason I am with her, supporting her and will do so till the end.”

A federal judge barred the Trump administration from using its ban on travelers from some countries to keep 80 already-vetted refugees from entering the United States.

In a decision late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle said President Donald Trump's June order banning the entry of people from 12 countries “expressly states” that it does not limit the ability of people to seek refugee status. 

The order, dubbed “Proclamation 10949—Restricting The Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,” includes a provision that says nothing in it “shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT, consistent with the laws of the United States.”

In his ruling, Whitehead said “by its plain terms, the Proclamation excludes refugees from its scope.”

Barring refugees from entering the U.S. would limit their ability to seek refugee status and therefore run counter to the Republican president's order, the judge added.

He ordered the administration to immediately resume processing 80 “presumptively protected refugees” that were rejected based on the travel ban.




The State Department did not immediately have comment Tuesday.

Whitehead also laid out a process for the government to vet refugees from the countries covered by the travel ban and other countries who were denied entry when the president suspended the nation's refugee admissions program within hours of taking office on Jan. 20. 




The decision left thousands of refugees who had already gone through a sometimes years-long vetting process to start new lives in America stranded at various locations around the world, including relatives of active-duty U.S. military personnel and more than 1,600 Afghans who assisted America's war efforts. 

Under a framework established by an appellate court, those refugees should be admitted if they had previously been cleared for travel to the U.S., had arranged and confirmable travel plans and had taken steps such as selling property or giving up their home that showed a reliance on the U.S. government's assurance of their refugee status.

The administration has previously said 12,000 people had been approved and booked for travel as refugees before it suspended the refugee program. Many of those cases will now have to be examined individually to see whether they meet the appeals court's criteria for entry. 

The lawsuit Whitehead is overseeing was filed in February by some individual refugees along with refugee aid organizations who said the administration froze their funding. The plaintiffs later asked the judge to make the case a class-action lawsuit so that the rulings could apply to other refugees facing similar circumstances. 

Whitehead said the suspension likely amounted to a nullification of congressional will, since Congress created and funded the refugee admissions program. He issued a preliminary injunction barring the federal government from suspending refugee processing and refugee aid funding. 

But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put most of that decision on hold in March, finding the administration was likely to win the case because the president has broad authority to determine who is allowed to enter the country. The appeals court later set out the criteria for admitting some of the refugees.

POMPEII, Italy (AP) — A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.

The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.

The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.

The mosaic — dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century — is considered a work of “extraordinary cultural interest,” experts said.

“It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. “While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.”

The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.

The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.

The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes.

“Today's return is like healing an open wound,” Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.

The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in “mentality,” as “the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.”

“We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,” Zuchtriegel said.

He recalled the so-called “Pompeii curse,” which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.

The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Mike Waltz painted an image for lawmakers Tuesday of what the United Nations would look like as the U.S. — its largest donor — reviews its support, opting to go “back to basics” under a Trump administration push to “make the U.N. great again.” 

During his Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Waltz echoed the priorities of his bosses — President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio — of pursuing major reforms to the 80-year-old world body.

It was the first time senators could grill Waltz since he was ousted as Trump's national security adviser in May after he mistakenly added a journalist to a private Signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans. He denied Tuesday that he was removed from the post, while laying out his plans to bring “America First” to the U.N.

“We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk — where China, Russia, Europe and the developing world can come together and resolve conflicts,” Waltz told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the U.N. “But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking.”

The U.N. is pursuing its own reforms while the Republican administration has spent the last six months reshaping American diplomacy and working aggressively to shrink the size of the federal government, including recent mass dismissals at the State Department.




On the agenda for Waltz would be combating China's influence, reviewing U.S. funding to U.N. agencies with “often duplicative and wasteful mandates,” as well as rooting out what Waltz called deep antisemitism within the U.N. system. 

The U.N. post is the last one to be filled in Trump's Cabinet following months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee.

The Signal episode — in which Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other high-level officials faced intense criticism — didn't come up at the hearing for more than an hour.

It was revealed in March that Waltz added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen.

“We both know Signal is not an appropriate and secure means of communicating highly sensitive information,” said Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who was first to raise the issue. 

He added that Waltz shared “demonstrably sensitive information” in an improper manner. Fellow Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia called it “an amateurish move.”

Waltz, a former Florida congressman, said the chat met the administration's cybersecurity standards, “no classified information was shared” and the military was still conducting an ongoing investigation. 

Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey blasted what he called a “lack of accountability” from Waltz and other administration officials.

“I've watched this hearing, and I've been really disappointed,” Booker said. “What's been troubling to me about your nomination from the beginning is your failure to just stand up and take accountability for mistakes that you made.”

If confirmed, Waltz would arrive at the U.N. at a moment of great change. The world body is reeling from Trump's decision to slash foreign assistance — affecting its humanitarian aid agencies — and it anticipates U.S. funding cuts to the U.N. annual budget.

Facing financial instability, the U.N. has spent months shedding jobs and consolidating projects while beginning to tackle long-delayed reforms. The U.N. is also facing growing frustration over what critics describe as a lack of efficiency and power in delivering on its mandate to end conflict.

“With Waltz at the helm, the U.N. will have what I regard as what should be its last chance to demonstrate its actual value to the United States,” said Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. “Instead of progressive political virtue signaling, the Security Council has the chance to prove its value, and settling disputes and brokering deals.”

Waltz said U.N. revenue “has quadrupled in the last 20 years” but that it hasn't been commensurate with increased peace.

“The U.S. must ensure that every foreign aid dollar and every contribution to an international organization, particularly the U.N., draws a straight and direct line to a compelling U.S. national interest,” Waltz said.

He said the administration's diplomatic strategy would be focused on cutting costs to what he called “waste, fraud, and abuse that are endemic to the U.N. system.”

Waltz also accused the U.N. of “pervasive antisemitism.” He testified that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has been promoting “antisemitic hate” in its schools in Gaza.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appointed a British human rights activist on Tuesday to carry out a strategic review of UNRWA.

Israel has alleged that 19 out of UNRWA's roughly 13,000 staffers in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that launched the war. UNRWA said it fired nine workers after an internal U.N. investigation. Israel later alleged that about 100 other Palestinians in Gaza were Hamas members but didn't provide evidence to the United Nations.

Waltz has spent the last few months on the White House payroll despite departing as national security adviser. The latest list of White House salaries, current as of July 1, includes Waltz as an adviser earning an annual salary of $195,200.

A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Waltz stayed on to “ensure a smooth and successful transition given the extreme importance of the role of NSA.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, questioned why Waltz was still being paid by the administration.

“Throughout this year, you've made (assertions) that, if confirmed, you would root out waste and unnecessary overhead at the U.N. So can you confirm for us whether you've been receiving a salary from the White House since being let go as the NSA?”

Waltz denied the fact that he had been fired, saying he was being paid as an adviser “transitioning a number of important activities.”

As Mike Waltz, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday for his confirmation hearing, focus returns to his ousting as national security adviser over what some referred to as “Signalgate.”

The former Florida Republican congressman served mere weeks in Trump's administration before revelations that he mistakenly added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic to a private Signal chat that was used to discuss sensitive military plans, including planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen.

Calls came quickly for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be removed from office, accompanied by criticism of the Trump administration for failing to take action against the top national security officials who discussed plans for the military strike in Signal. After weeks of scrutiny, Waltz left his security post but was swiftly nominated to the U.N. position.

Months after the chat was disclosed, questions remain over the controversy, including if federal laws were violated, if classified information was exposed on the commercial messaging app and if anyone else will face consequences. 

Here's what we know and don't know:

___

KNOWN: Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked. It is not approved for carrying classified information. On March 14, one day before the strikes, the Defense Department cautioned personnel about the vulnerability of Signal, specifically that Russia was attempting to hack the app, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak to the press and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 




One known vulnerability is that a malicious actor, if they have access to a person's phone, can link their own device to the user's Signal — and monitor messages remotely.

NOT KNOWN: How frequently the administration and the Defense Department use Signal for sensitive government communications, and whether those on the chat were using unauthorized personal devices to transmit or receive those messages. The department put out an instruction in 2023 restricting what information could be posted on unauthorized and unclassified systems. 

At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard would not say whether she was accessing the information on her personal phone or government-issued phone, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Security Council. 

___

KNOWN: The government has a requirement under the Presidential Records Act to archive all of those planning discussions. 

NOT KNOWN: Whether anyone in the group archived the messages as required by law to a government server. The images of the text chain posted by The Atlantic show that the messages were set to disappear in one week. 

___

KNOWN: Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon's security protocols — known in the IT industry as a “dirty” internet line — set up in his office to use Signal on a personal computer, two people familiar with the line have told The Associated Press.

Other Pentagon offices have used them, particularly if there's a need to monitor information or websites that would otherwise be blocked. The biggest advantage of using such a line is that the user would not show up as an IP address assigned to the Defense Department — essentially the user is masked, according to a senior U.S. official familiar with military network security.

NOT KNOWN: If use of the line left any Defense-related materials more vulnerable than they would have been on a Pentagon secure line.

___

KNOWN: The chat group included 18 members, including Jeffrey Goldberg, top editor of The Atlantic. The group, called “Houthi PC Small Group,” likely for Houthi “principals committee” — was comprised of Trump's senior-most advisers on national security, including Gabbard, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.” 

NOT KNOWN: How Goldberg got added. Waltz said he built the message chain and didn't know how Goldberg ended up on the chat. He called it a mistake.

___

KNOWN: Just hours before the attack on the Houthis in Yemen began, Hegseth shared details on the timing, targets, weapons and sequence of strikes that would take place. 

NOT KNOWN: Whether the information was classified. Gabbard, Ratcliffe and the White House have all said it was not classified, and Hegseth said the same in a post on social media. Democrats said that strains credulity. 

___

KNOWN: Hegseth has adamantly denied that “war plans” were texted on Signal, something current and former U.S. officials called “semantics.” War plans carry a specific meaning. They often refer to the numbered and highly classified planning documents — sometimes thousands of pages long — that would inform U.S. decisions in case of a major conflict. 

But the information Hegseth did post — specific attack details selecting human and weapons storage targets — was a subset of those plans and was likely informed by the same classified intelligence. Posting those details to an unclassified app risked tipping off adversaries of the pending attack and could have put U.S. service members at risk, multiple U.S. officials said. 

Sharing that information on a commercial app like Signal in advance of a strike “would be a violation of everything that we're about,” said former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who served under Democratic President Barack Obama. 

NOT KNOWN: If anyone outside the messaging group got access to the Signal texts.

___

KNOWN: Hegseth began cracking down on unauthorized leaks of information inside the Defense Department, and his chief of staff issued a memo on March 21 saying the Pentagon would use polygraph tests to determine the sources of recent leaks and prosecute them.

NOT KNOWN: Whether Hegseth will take responsibility for the unauthorized release of national defense information regarding the attack plans on the Houthis. Trump in March bristled at a suggestion that Hegseth should step down, saying “He's doing a great job. He had nothing to do with it.”

___

KNOWN: In April, Dan Caldwell, a senior Hegseth adviser who in the Signal chat had been designated as the secretary's point person, was placed on administrative leave and escorted out of the Pentagon by security. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters told The AP that the former Marine's sudden downfall was tied to an investigation into unauthorized disclosure of department information. 

NOT KNOWN: If any others affiliated with the Signal situation will face reprisals.

___

KNOWN: Also in April, Hegseth was forced to defend himself against a second assertion that he shared classified material through an unapproved and unsecured network, this time taking airstrike information from a military communications channel and sharing it in a Signal chat with his wife, his brother and others. A person familiar with the chat confirmed to The AP that Hegseth pulled the information — such as launch times and bomb drop times of U.S. warplanes about to strike Houthi targets in Yemen — he posted in the chat from a secure communications channel used by U.S. Central Command. 

NOT KNOWN: If that's the extent of Hegseth's Signal usage.

___

KNOWN: The Pentagon's watchdog has begun looking into Hegseth's use of Signal, and also whether any of Hegseth's aides were asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter.

NOT KNOWN: What the inspector general will find, or what will be done as a result of those findings.

The Supreme Court is allowing President Donald Trump to put his plan to dismantle the Education Department back on track and go through with laying off nearly 1,400 employees.

With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court on Monday paused an order from U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, who issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs and calling into question the broader plan.

The high court action enables the administration to resume work on winding down the department, one of Trump's biggest campaign promises.

Trump said on social media that the decision was a “major victory” for students and parents, and that the department's functions would now go “BACK TO THE STATES.”

The Trump administration has made it harder for people, local and state governments to find critical climate change reports. 

NASA announced Monday it would not host the National Climate Assessments, reversing earlier plans. These reports detail climate impacts across the U.S. and were previously available on government websites that went offline earlier this month. 

The 2023 report highlights how climate change threatens health, security and livelihoods, with marginalized communities facing disproportionate risks.

NASA stated it has no legal obligation to host the data. Critics, including scientists, accuse the administration of trying to bury vital information.

A broken promise to release more information about the Jeffrey Epstein case has sparked outrage among some of Trump's loyal supporters.

Conservatives, led by key figures in the “Make America Great Again” movement, have pressed unsubstantiated claims that Epstein was murdered and that “deep state” actors in the government are hiding lists of his clients, videos of crimes being committed and other evidence. Trump himself has highlighted conspiracy theories related to Epstein.

But Trump lately has tried to change the subject. The Justice Department last week said Epstein, who was facing charges of sex trafficking, did not leave behind a “client list.”

It's a huge retreat from what Attorney General Pam Bondi and others had previously claimed. And it prompted anger — and more suspicion and conspiracy theories — from the MAGA faithful. Figures like commentator Tucker Carlson, activist Laura Loomer and Trump's former adviser, Steve Bannon, claim the government's handling of the case shows a lack of transparency.

The president is hailing as a “major victory” the Supreme Court's decision allowing his administration to move forward with dismantling the Education Department and laying off nearly 1,400 of its employees.

The high court “has handed a Major Victory to Parents and Students across the Country,” Trump posted on his social media site.

He said the decision will allow his administration to begin the “very important process” of returning many of the department's functions “BACK TO THE STATES.”

“The Federal Government has been running our Education System into the ground, but we are going to turn it all around by giving the Power back to the PEOPLE,” Trump wrote.

The president's motorcade arrived at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's house in the Foxhall neighborhood of Washington for a private dinner.

The White House says Monday is Lutnick's 64th birthday.

The press pool traveling with Trump didn't see him enter Lutnick's home, and no guest list was provided.

It was unclear how long Trump will be staying.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Dick Blumenthal are reacting enthusiastically to Trump's warning of “severe tariffs” on Russia unless a peace deal is reached within 50 days to end the war in Ukraine.

The two senators have a bill that would impose secondary tariffs and sanctions on countries doing business with Russia.

Graham told reporters that when it comes to Russia, “The rhetoric that Trump is using publicly and privately has definitely changed.”

“Between the weapons flowing and sanctions and tariffs on the table, I think we can say today was a game changer that we've been waiting on and hoping for,” Graham said.

Blumenthal later joined Graham in talking to reporters, saying that Trump's “action is good, our bill is better.”

He added that Trump's warning is “a powerful step in the right direction.”

The Supreme Court's decision to allow the dismantling of the Education Department will impact millions of Latino students, civil rights organization Voto Latino said in a statement.

Calling the department “a generational lifeline for Latino families,” the statement said the department guarantees access to financial aid, protects the rights of students with disabilities and enforces civil rights.

“Without it, over 18 million Latino students stand to lose more than just support – they lose their chance to thrive,” Voto Latino said.

The statement went on to say the question is not bureaucracy but whether Latino families get to “dream, achieve, and belong in this country.”

That is especially true in states like California, Texas and Florida, where Latino students make up over half of the K-12 population, Voto Latino said.

The Republican-led Senate voted 46-42 along party lines to approve Whitney Hermandorfer, who worked for Tennessee's attorney general, as a judge for the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Trump and former President Joe Biden each worked to reshape the judiciary during their respective past terms; the Democratic-led Senate under Biden confirmed 235 federal judges, and the Republican-led Senate in Trump's first term confirmed 234.

So far in his second term, Trump has had fewer judicial vacancies to fill than when he inherited more than 100 at the end of former President Barack Obama's term. Trump now has 49 vacancies to fill out of almost 900 federal judgeships.

Hermandorfer defended many of Trump's policies as director of strategic litigation for Tennessee's attorney general, including his bid to end birthright citizenship. Democrats and liberal judicial advocacy groups criticized her as extreme on that issue and others, also citing her office's defense of the state's strict abortion ban.

Dan Bongino, Trump's deputy FBI director, showed up at work on Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues. The FBI declined to comment.

Bongino has clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the recent decision to withhold records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. That move has rankled influential far-right media personalities and Trump supporters.

Trump has taken an unconventional approach to trade negotiations by sending foreign leaders form letters threatening higher tariffs while offering a chance to negotiate. 

On Thursday, he raised tariffs on Canadian imports to 35%, effective Aug. 1, and he announced 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union and Mexico on Saturday. Trump has also targeted Brazil with a 50% tariff, which could increase U.S. prices for coffee and orange juice. 

Responses have varied, with Canada opting for diplomacy while Brazil threatens retaliation. Trump claims the letters signal his willingness to make deals despite the confusion they cause.

A little less than 12,000 Afghans living in the U.S. have been protected from deportation and got a work permit under a U.S. government program called Temporary Protective Status.

But as of Monday, that is going away.

Homeland Security said in May that it was ending the protective status in 60 days, saying that conditions in Afghanistan had improved.

The number of Afghans protected by TPS is relatively small compared to the overall number of Afghans — about 180,000 — who came to the U.S. since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021.

But the suggestion that it's safe to return to Afghanistan has angered many advocates and volunteers.

The U.S. government says it's placing a 17% duty on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations ended without an agreement to avert the tariff. 

Proponents say the import tax announced Monday will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. 

Mexico currently supplies around 70% of U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. 

Opponents, including U.S. companies that grow tomatoes in Mexico, say the tariff will make fresh tomatoes more expensive for U.S. buyers.

Trump and his education secretary, Linda McMahon, have acknowledged only Congress has authority to close the Education Department fully, but both have suggested its core functions could be parceled out to different federal agencies.

Among the most important decisions is where to put management of federal student loans, a $1.6 trillion portfolio affecting nearly 43 million borrowers.

Trump in March suggested the Small Business Administration would take on federal student loans, but a June court filing indicated the Treasury Department is expected to take over the work.

 The Education Department said it had been negotiating a contract with Treasury but paused discussions when the court intervened. That work is now expected to proceed in coming days.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine had what he called a “very good conversation” by phone with Trump.

“Thank you for the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings,” Zelenskyy wrote.

He said Trump detailed Trump's meeting Monday with Mark Rutte, NATO's secretary general, and said it was important that “Alliance countries are working to increase defense spending.”

“We discussed the necessary means and solutions with the President to provide better protection for people from Russian attacks and to strengthen our positions,” Zelenskyy wrote, adding that he was “ready to work as productively as possible to achieve peace.”

Zelenskyy added that Trump had “agreed to catch up more often by phone and coordinate our steps in the future.”

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Trump campaigned on a promise to quickly end Russia's war with Ukraine, but instead spent the first six months of his administration “playing footsie” with Putin while the Russian president unleashes a military assault on Ukraine.

“How's that working out?” said Jeffries of New York during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol.

“Vladimir Putin has spent the entire year punking Donald Trump and the Trump administration,” he said.

The Democratic leader dismissed Trump's new plan for an peace deal within 50 days, and said Congress should impose sanctions on Russia to pressure an end to the war.

The Supreme Court is allowing President Donald Trump to put his plan to dismantle the Education Department back on track and go through with laying off nearly 1,400 employees.

With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court on Monday paused an order from U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, who issued a preliminary injunction reversing the layoffs and calling into question the broader plan.

The layoffs “will likely cripple the department,” Joun wrote. A federal appeals court refused to put the order on hold while the administration appealed.

The high court action enables the administration to resume work on winding down the department, one of Trump's biggest campaign promises.

German's defense minister is visiting the Pentagon to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as his country works to increase its defense spending and assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius met with his American counterpart Monday afternoon. Speaking to reporters Pistorius said Germany is working to take on greater responsibilities for European defense. He cited Germany's increased defense funding as well as the work it has done to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

“We are determined to assume greater responsibility for Europe's deterrence and defense, while recognizing that the contribution of the United States of America remains indispensable to our collective security,” Pistorius said.

The meeting came on the same day that Trump announced a plan that would see European allies buy U.S. military equipment including Patriot air defense missiles to be transferred to Ukraine.

Hegseth cited that deal as well as the creation of a new German brigade in Lithuania as evidence of Germany's contribution to security.

“We've seen incredible progress inside NATO and with Germany taking the lead on that,” Hegseth said.

Mike Waltz, Trump's ex-national security adviser who was eventually nominated to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is still collecting a paycheck at the White House.

He was booted as national security adviser in May. Waltz had come under fire for adding the cell phone number of a journalist to a Signal chat thread with top administration officials discussing national security matters. He also was being attacked by far-right personality Laura Loomer for being insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda.

But the latest list of White House salaries, current as of July 1, includes Waltz earning an annual salary of $195,200, which is what most top Trump aides made. His title is listed as “advisor.”

A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Waltz stayed on at the White House to “ensure a smooth and successful transition given the extreme importance of the role of NSA.""Waltz has his confirmation hearing for the United Nations job on Tuesday.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was responding to a question asking his reaction to President Trump saying if there is no deal to end the war in Ukraine in 50 days he will impose biting sanctions on Russia.

He said “we absolutely need” an immediate ceasefire and a political solution must be based on the U.N. Charter, which guarantees the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all 193 U.N. member nations, as well as on international law and resolutions by the General Assembly and others.

“Whatever can contribute to these objectives will, of course, be important, if it is done in line with international law,” Guterres said.

More than 20 Democratic-led states are suing the Trump administration to force the release of billions of dollars in federal funding for programs such as after-school care and summer day camps.

The federal government has withheld more than $6 billion in federal grants that officials say were used to support a “a radical leftwing agenda.” The money was passed by Congress and set to be released to states July 1, but the administration said it was holding it back amid a review.

The grants also funded English language instruction, adult literacy and more.Many low-income families will lose access to after-school programs if the money isn't released soon, according to the suit. In some states, school restarts in late July and early August.

Led by California, the suit alleges that withholding the money violates the Constitution and several federal laws.

He also touted a recent decision allowing religious leaders to endorse candidates without their organizations losing tax exempt status.

Addressing religious leaders at a White House event, Trump said “you have more power than anybody, but you're not allowed to use your power.”

Russian commentators began to react to Trump's announcement with NATO's Mark Rutte late Monday Moscow time. There has not yet been an official statement from the Kremlin.

“Trump's dream is for war to be a business — to sell weapons to the EU,” Pro-Kremlin military blogger Yuri Kotenok wrote in a post on Telegram.Others made light of Trump's threat of tariffs.

“Oh, how much can change both on the battlefield and with the mood of those leading the U.S. and NATO in 50 days,” said senior lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev.

Trump's remarks quickly turned from religion to the economy. He called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell “a knucklehead, stupid guy” who is costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars. 

He continued by touting the billions taken in by U.S. tariffs so far.

“I've always made money,” he said. “Now I'm making it for you people.”

The president began his remarks at an event hosted by the White House Faith Office by expressing his support for religion in public life.

“A nation that prays is a nation that prospers,” he said.

President Donald Trump appears to be blaming Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the high cost of housing in the U.S.

Trump on Monday repeated his attacks on Powell for not cutting the Fed's benchmark interest rate, saying that the head of the U.S. central bank has been “terrible” and “doesn't know what the hell he's doing.” Powell has held off on further reductions to the rate controlled by the Fed given Trump's tariffs, saying that Fed officials want to see how the import taxes influence inflation and economic growth.

Trump said the economy was doing well despite Powell's refusal to reduce rates to Trump's liking, but it would be “nice” if there rate cuts “because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.”

The Fed's concern is that rate cuts on the scale discussed by Trump could worsen inflation if, in fact, his tariffs result in higher prices across the U.S. economy. There is also the possibility that tariffs harm economic growth in ways that require rate cuts in order to limit job losses.

Trump is repeating his assertions that his predecessor's use of the autopen is a major scandal.

He was asked for his reaction to Biden's comments to The New York Times that he approved a series of pardons at the end of his term, then directed the use of the autopen to make them official. Trump responded of his predecessor, “""I guarantee he knew nothing about what he was singing.”

Trump added that it was unfortunate that Biden got to use the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office just like he does.

And he noted that, while the use of the autopen is legal, it is “not supposed to be for signing major legislation” and things like presidential pardons.

Trump derided the Gaza Strip as “one of the worst real estate deals ever made” and suggested that its formation involved giving up “oceanfront property.”

The president has for months suggested that Israel could seize control of Gaza amid its war with Hamas there, and then cede it to the U.S.Trump has said repeatedly that U.S. authorities could then transform the area into a Riviera-like resort.

Trump said one of his administration's chief foreign envoys, Steve Witkoff, would be working on Gaza and that there could be something “fairly soon to talk about” on that front.

Trump and Rutte say Germany is going to supply Ukraine with a massive amount of weaponry, including Patriot missile defense systems, as part of the broader initiative by the U.S. and the alliance to shore up Ukrainian defenses.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is due to meet later Monday with Pete Hegseth to discuss the Patriot transfers, which Trump and Rutte said could occur within days.

Trump repeated his frustration that Putin has resisted making a deal with Ukraine to end the war. 

He said his conversations with the Russian president “are always very pleasant,” but “then missiles go off that night.”

Putin “knows what a fair deal is,” Trump said.

Trump seems increasingly sanguine about European nations playing a larger role in opposing Russia's war with Ukraine and spending more to help increase military security on the continent.

Trump says he's pleased with Europe spending more on defense — after many NATO members at a recent summit in The Hague agreed to increase spending to 5% of their GDP — and reiterated his complaints that the U.S. still spends heavily to defend Ukraine.

“The spirit they have is amazing,” Trump said. “Ultimately, having a very strong Europe is a good thing,” Trump said. 

Trump says of a GOP-championed sanctions package against Russia, “I'm not sure we need it.”

The president noted shortly thereafter, however, that some top Republicans in the Senate were working hard on the matter. He added that he didn't want them to “waste their time.”

“It could be very useful, we'll have to see,” Trump said.

The president also talked about how the finished legislative sanctions package could eventually punish Russia with tariffs exceeding 100%. But he said he plans to impose 100% tariffs unilaterally soon if Russia's war in Ukraine isn't concluded.

Trump says the European governments will then transfer the munitions to Ukraine under a new deal to support Kyiv in defending itself against Russia.

Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday with Rutte that those transfers — combined with a threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Russian exports if a peace deal isn't reached within 50 days — should serve as notice to Putin that he's serious about ending the war.

Trump did not provide details but said the weapons would include Patriot missile defense batteries.

Mark Rutte said Europeans will buy weapons from the U.S. to equip Ukraine, and that the armaments and equipment should cause Russian President Vladimir Putin to “reconsider” peace negotiations.

Rutte said Ukraine would get “massive numbers of military equipment” such as missiles, air defense systems and ammunition.

“Speed is of the essence here,” said Rutte. He said Germany, Finland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Denmark would be among the buyers to supply Ukraine.

The president promised “biting” tariffs if the war doesn't end. He described them as secondary tariffs, meaning they would target Russia's trading partners. If implemented, it would be an attempt to isolate Moscow in the global economy.

“We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said during a meeting with NATO's secretary general.

The president suggested such levies could feature 100% tariffs. It wasn't immediately clear what products could be targeted.

Trump's cuts to international programs, tariffs on allies and partners, and unfriendly moves against international students have “deeply” undermined U.S. competitiveness in its rivalry against China, warned the Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a report released today. 

The report calls for action by Congress to rebuild tools to restore the U.S. global reputation and influence so that U.S. won't be unseated by China as the world's leading power.

“America's retreat from the world will have real and lasting consequences for the American people,” it says. “A retreat from the system that we helped build following the Second World War — based on democracy, economic interdependence and American values — means China is increasingly able to set the global agenda at the expense of U.S. interests.”

Data from CoinMarketCap showed Bitcoin climbed above $123,000 early Monday, up from about $108,000 only a week ago. The cryptocurrency is now the fifth most valuable asset class in the world at $2.4 trillion, with a higher market cap than Amazon.

The House is under pressure from Trump and the big-spending crypto lobby to quickly pass legislation including a bill passed last month by the Senate to regulate so-called stablecoins. The House is considering far more sweeping cryptocurrency market structure legislation. 

Trump, once a skeptic, vowed to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. He and his family have moved into mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.

The S&P 500 was edging down early Monday, still within 0.5% of its all-time high set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite were holding steady in their first trading after Trump said he plans 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union starting Aug. 1, the same deadline he announced for Japan, South Korea and a dozen other countries.

The latest postponements allow time for more dealmaking to mitigate economic damage. Enacting all his import taxes on U.S. consumers would raise the risk of a recession and raise U.S. debt pressure as big tax cuts add to the deficit.

Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the Trump administration “will ultimately de-escalate, especially if there is a new bout of heightened bond and stock market volatility.”

As Trump slaps trading partners with tariffs rather than slog through prolonged negotiations, pressures the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and launches a new investigation aimed at reshaping higher education, it's clear that threats are a permanent feature of his presidency. 

He's tightening his grip on independent institutions, with fewer checks on his power. Republicans in Congress fear primary challenges, and the Supreme Court is stocked with his appointees.

Trump's allies believe his aggression is required in a political ecosystem where he's under siege from Democrats, the court system and the media. Critics fear he's eroding the country's democratic foundations with an authoritarian style.

“Pluralism and a diversity of institutions operating with autonomy — companies, the judiciary, nonprofit institutions that are important elements of society — are much of what defines real democracy,” said Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard University. “That is threatened by heavy handed, extortionist approaches.”

They met in Kyiv on Monday as anticipation grew over a possible shift in the Trump administration's policy on the three-year war.

Zelenskyy said he and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg had “a productive conversation” about strengthening Ukrainian air defenses, joint arms production, purchasing U.S. weapons in conjunction with European countries and the possibility of tighter sanctions on the Kremlin.

Trump has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin's unbudging stance on U.S-led peace efforts. “I am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said,” Trump said late Sunday. 

“We hope for the leadership of the United States, because it is clear that Moscow will not stop unless its ... ambitions are stopped by force,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.

These children attend after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, YMCA or public school for free thanks to funding set Congress set aside for academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families. Many now face closure as the Trump administration withholds more than $6 billion in federal education grants to align with his priorities.

Ninety-one of the 100 school districts receiving the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. 

“I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,” said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican.

Spending bills almost always need some bipartisan buy-in to get 60 votes to avoid a filibuster in the 100-member Senate. This week's effort is different.

Congress set up a process under President Richard Nixon to speedily claw back previously approved spending authority with only a simple Senate majority. It's a rarely employed maneuver. Trump proposed 38 rescissions in 2018, but that package stalled.

“How Republicans answer this question on rescissions and other forthcoming issues will have grave implications for the Congress, the very role of the legislative branch, and, more importantly, our country,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned in a letter to colleagues. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's disappointed to see Schumer “implicitly threaten to shut down the government.”

The Trump administration is likening this as a test case and says more could come if Congress goes along.

Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — the full amount it's due to receive during the next two budget years. 

The corporation distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations. Much of the rest supports national programming through National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System.

The potential fallout has generated concerns among Republicans. Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota says these radio stations “are the only way of really communicating in the very rural areas of our state, and a lot of other states as well.”

In recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized a “Sesame Street” town hall on CNN about combating racism.

Senate Republicans will test the popularity of Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts this week by aiming to pass Trump's request to claw back $9.4 billion in public media and foreign aid spending.

Senate Democrats are trying to kill the measure, but they need help from a few Republicans.

A rarely used tool allows the president to request the cancellation of previously approved funding authority, triggering a 45-day clock under which the funds are frozen. If Congress fails to act before that clock expires Friday, the spending stands.

The House has already approved Trump's request on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. The Senate has little time to spare. Another House vote will be needed if senators amend the legislation, adding more uncertainty.

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels following Trump's surprise announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union.  

“ We should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox,” said Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. “So we want a deal, but there's an old saying: 'If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.'”

If Trump makes good on his tariff threats against dozens of countries, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.

▶ Read more about the European Union on Trump tariffs talks

''This is now the time for negotiations,'' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday after Trump sent a letter announcing new 30% tariffs on all EU goods starting Aug. 1.

The America's biggest trading partner and the world's largest trading bloc had been scheduled to impose ''countermeasures'' starting Monday at midnight.

''We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,'' she said. If they can't reach a deal, she said that ''we will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.''

A survivor of a Sunday blaze that tore through an assisted living facility in Massachusetts has claimed that staff members abandoned the burning scene leaving the elderly residents to fend for themselves – while another said that workers didn't even knock at doors to alert the seniors as the flames spread.

Resident Lorraine Ferrara, 70, told the Associated Press of her shock to see staff running away from the fire that ultimately killed 9 people and injured dozens more at Gabriel House in Fall River. 

""They left us alone and ran,"" Ferrara said. ""I was hanging out the window — ‘Help! Help!' — and they just kept running.""

DEADLY OVERNIGHT BLAZE CLAIMS 9 LIVES AT MASSACHUSETTS ASSISTED LIVING HOME AS RESCUE EFFORTS CONTINUE

Meanwhile, resident Robert Cabral also said that workers fled the terrifying scene as smoke filled rooms. 

""They didn't knock on one door,"" Cabral said. ""They just ran.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Gabriel Care, the operators of the facility, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. 

The deceased were aged 61 to 86. The facility opened in 1999 and had 100 units with about 70 people residing there at the time.

As well as workers apparently fleeing the scene, reports have emerged of an alleged lack of fire drills at the facility, while a firefighters union said inadequate staffing hindered the response to the blaze.

Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts Secretary of Elder Affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned by reports about the apparent lack of fire drills as well a low number of staff for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows.

""It's a terrible tragedy that should have never happened,"" Lanzikos told the Associated Press.

About 50 firefighters responded to the scene at around 9:50 p.m., including 30 who were off duty. Police also helped break down doors and carried about a dozen residents to safety. Five injured firefighters were released from the hospital Monday.

Edward Kelly, president of the national firefighters union, said eight additional firefighters would have been on scene if national staffing recommendations were followed.

Capt. Frank O'Reagan said there was no breathing equipment available when he arrived, so he started going door to door on the third floor without an air tank until the smoke got to him.

O'Reagan's brother and fellow firefighter Michael O'Reagan said he was shocked that 40 minutes after firefighters arrived, a large part of the building had not been searched.

""We did the best we could with what we had, and what we had was not enough,"" said Michael O'Reagan, president of the Fall River firefighters union.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Officials said it did not appear suspicious, 

Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon told Boston 25 News that staffing levels is not unique to Fall River and that municipalities across the Commonwealth face similar concerns.

""The crews were faced with an incredibly difficult situation. A fire is a difficult situation, a rescue is a difficult situation,"" Bacon said. ""When you combine the two at the level this call asked for, it was almost an impossible situation.""

President Donald Trump, fresh off reaching a new agreement with NATO to arm Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion, cautioned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky against launching direct military strikes against the Russian capital.

On Monday, Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced that the United States would sell new weapons systems to NATO allies, who would then supply them directly to Ukrainian defense forces.

However, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he did not plan to include long-range missiles in that transfer.

“We're not looking to do that,” the president said before adding that Zelensky “shouldn't target Moscow.”

In addition to the new weapons agreement, Trump announced a 50-day window for Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease hostilities or face new 100% tariffs and secondary sanctions. He defended that timeline Tuesday, saying he didn't think that “50 days is very long, and it could be sooner than that.”

“At the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, it's gonna be too bad. The tariffs are going to go on, and other sanctions,” he continued before castigating reporters for asking questions about his deadline.

“Did you ask that same question to Biden? Why did he get us into this war?” Trump countered. “Because he's a dummy, that's why. Because he's incompetent. It would have never happened if I were president.”

Ultimately, despite his apparent shift in support away from Russia toward Ukraine, Trump told reporters that he's “on nobody's side” in the conflict.

“You know what side I'm on? Humanity's side. I want to stop the killing of thousands of people right away,” he closed. “Stop the killing. I want the killing to stop in the Ukraine-Russia war. That's the side I'm on.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley raised no money in the latest campaign finance reporting period, despite being up for reelection next year.

Bradley has not formally announced her reelection bid but told WisPolitics in April that she planned to run to “ensure that there is a voice for the constitution and for the rule of law to preserve that in the state of Wisconsin.”

She has not raised money since 2022 when she reported $700, according to the Associated Press.

Her possible opponent, Wisconsin state Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor, raised $585,000 since launching her campaign in May.

“The overwhelming support for Judge Taylor early in this race shows how committed Wisconsinites are to reinforcing the majority on the court and electing a justice who will protect their rights and freedoms,” Taylor campaign manager Ashley Franz said in a statement. “Judge Taylor's broad base of support reflects her commitment to serving all Wisconsinites and ensuring our courts remain fair and independent.”

Bradley was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by then-Gov. Scott Walker in 2015 and won a full 10-year term in 2016. She is one of the most outspoken justices on the court.

Her lack of funds comes as the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race was the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history, beating the state's 2023 Supreme Court race, which, at the time, was the most expensive judicial race. Justice-elect Susan Crawford and her conservative opponent, Brad Schimel, raised a combined $100 million.

Taylor's haul outpaces that of Crawford's $460,000 haul in the same time frame.

The state's 2026 Supreme Court race will be less high-stakes than the last two, as it does not have the ability to sway the ideological leaning of the court. Crawford's win means liberal-leaning justices will retain control of the high court until at least 2028.

EVERY WISCONSIN COUNTY SHIFTED LEFT IN STATE SUPREME COURT RACE

Liberal-leaning candidates have won four of the last five Wisconsin Supreme Court elections by double-digit margins. If conservatives lose Bradley's seat next year, the court's 4-3 liberal majority will grow to 5-2.

The election, which is technically nonpartisan, will take place on April 7, 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The autopen investigation and Biden's last line of defense","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3471511/autopen-investigation-biden-last-line-defense/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 18:01:07 GMT","

When a spate of books detailing former President Joe Biden's age-related struggles in office and alleging his frailties were concealed from the public was released, his team retained one last line of defense.

“There is nothing in this book that shows Joe Biden failed to do his job, as the authors have alleged, nor did they prove their allegation that there was a cover up or conspiracy,” a Biden spokesperson said in response to the publicant of the most revealing of these books, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, written by the journalists Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios. “Nowhere do they show that our national security was threatened or where the President wasn't otherwise engaged in the important matters of the Presidency.”

The congressional investigation into the Biden White House's autopen use could chip away at that defense. Biden was three layers removed from the autopen operator on some of the clemency actions, for example, according to his own team's account.

Over time, we have seen a steady erosion of other defenses of Biden: that junior staffers had difficulty keeping up with him, that he had never been better, that he was prepared to maul his predecessor-turned-successor in their only presidential debate, that videos purporting to show him slowing down were misleading “cheap fakes,” if not quite deliberately altered deepfakes.

Now, the top Biden spokeswoman who defended his energy and mental acuity has written her own book that refers to a “broken White House” right in the subtitle. Journalists who once said it was “lying” to suggest that Biden was somehow diminished now write, “Biden was in no position to keep doing his job given his condition, which had been evident for years to most people paying even casual attention.” Participants in the fundraiser at which footage of Biden being led off stage was said to be a “cheap fake” now say he was out of it.

Virtually no one who wasn't on Biden's campaign payroll or related to him by blood or marriage would defend his debate performance. Indeed, the former president himself doesn't defend it.

It has since been reported that there were discussions of having Biden use a wheelchair after the election. He has also been portrayed as unable to successfully execute basic campaign videos. A top communications adviser to former Vice President Kamala Harris was said to have developed an elaborate strategy to bolster her legitimacy if Biden died unexpectedly and she needed to assume the presidency all of a sudden. That last bit of preparation is part of the vice president's job, of course, but the details don't suggest much confidence in Biden's ability to serve until his second term would have ended at 86.

Biden's top advisers have been described as “the politburo,” helping the first octogenarian president navigate the office and insulating him from public scrutiny to the best of their ability within the confines of a 24/7 news cycle. “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board,” Tapper and Thompson report they were told.

What hasn't been proven is that Biden didn't make presidential decisions himself or that he was unavailable when an important decision needed to be made, though the former has been alleged. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has said Biden did not appear to understand his own administration's liquefied natural gas policy after the Louisianan was finally able to secure a one-on-one meeting with the then-president. Donald Trump repeatedly argued as far back as the 2020 campaign that Biden would not be the one calling the shots if elected. Trump has claimed vindication on this score since returning to the Oval Office.

Maybe it will never be proven. Biden's tight-knit operation may be impenetrable to outside investigators. Maybe it is simply not true. Maybe, as Democrats insisted when Biden ended his reelection bid but remained in office, he had deteriorated as a campaigner but could still handle the rigors of governing.

“While Biden on a day-in, day-out basis could certainly make decisions and assert wisdom and act as President, there were several significant issues that complicated his Presidency: a limit to the hours in which he could reliably function and an increasing number of moments when he seemed to freeze up, lose his train of thought, forget the names of top aides, or momentarily not remember friends he'd known for decades,” Thompson and Tapper write. “Not to mention impairments to his ability to communicate — ones unrelated to his lifelong stutter.”

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

But even if we accept that Biden had good days and bad days, it raises the questions: How were decisions made, and how was the president handled during the bad days? How long were the bad days? What was the ratio of bad to good? Did this affect how the vast federal bureaucracy was supervised? Most importantly, was presidential power ever exercised by someone other than the president, even if they believed they were acting in accordance with his wishes?

Those are the answers autopen investigators will seek, despite efforts to muddy the waters, knowing how poorly some past defenses of Biden have fared under closer inspection.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Dear James,

Two years ago, desperately lonely, I became involved in the first serious relationship of my life. It began when the woman I was into pressured me into sexting her. I was sexually inexperienced and uncomfortable with the idea, and when I told her this, she accused me of “sex shaming” and bombarded me with a bunch of angry texts. Eventually, I gave in, mostly because I thought this was my only chance to be with someone.

Things got worse from there. I was struggling with mental-health issues; she was an alcoholic. She was also dating and living with another guy and saw me only in secret. She promised me the moon, however, and swore that I was the love of her life. After years of intense loneliness and self-loathing, I felt validated in ways I'd never felt before.

We soon went through a cycle in which she would get upset and begin attacking my character. I would try to break up with her, she would call me crazy and harass me with texts, and I would eventually call her names in hopes that it would make her stop. It didn't work, and eventually I would give in, trying to reconcile until the cycle repeated.

Then she got pregnant. But she kept drinking and seeing her other boyfriend. I said this was unacceptable. We planned to terminate the pregnancy and had one last horrible fight, where she called me evil and pathetic and made it clear that other than paying the bill, she didn't want me involved in the abortion. I didn't hear from her after that.

Months later, I still didn't know whether she'd gone through with the abortion, so I got in touch to find out. I learned that she had ended the pregnancy and was getting serious with someone new. She didn't apologize for anything. I couldn't handle this, and to my great shame and guilt, I began sending her unwanted texts (with more name-calling). She accused me of harassment. I apologized and vowed to leave her alone.

We've now gone two years without contact. I'm in a relationship with a kind, healthy woman, and I haven't repeated any of the bad behaviors that I engaged in with my ex. I've had therapy, but I struggle to sit with the complexity and guilt of having participated in a pattern of mutual verbal abuse. Everyone I confide in tells me that I'm not defined by this relationship, and that I need to forgive myself. But the guilt remains unbearable. I never thought I could be so cruel, and I don't know how to put this behind me, or even whether I should. Any advice?

Dear Reader,

The philosopher Georges Bataille, not a man whose body of work I'd necessarily recommend to souls in jeopardy, nevertheless gifted us one very helpful phrase: unemployed negativity. What he meant by it, I'm not sure. But I know exactly what I mean by it.

Guilt, remorse, mortification, scrupulosity—pull out your thesaurus and we can binge on words for shame, each with its own flavor, its own particular sting. Self-obloquy: How about that? We do things in this life, we do things to other people, and some of them are terrible. The spasms of our conscience, promptly or not so promptly, alert us to the terrible things. We show contrition for them, we endeavor to understand them (so as not to repeat them), and we do our best to fix them. And that's it. That's all we can do. Whatever darkness or pain is left over from this process, whatever tormenting residue remains, whatever carries on messing with us—that's what I call unemployed negativity. In other words, it's no good; it serves nobody; it is literally without utility. All it does is ruin us.

In your situation, it sounds like the good part of shame—the accountability, the desire to improve one's behavior—has been naturally consumed or burned off in its alchemical reaction with your heart. What you're left with now, even though your heart has been altered, is a quantity of tar, of bitumen, of the inkiest and stickiest stuff. It doesn't want to let go of you. So you must let go of it.

No doubt your ex-girlfriend has her own version of events. No doubt it diverges significantly from yours. But you took responsibility for your actions, you apologized to her, you got yourself some therapy, and you've kept your promise to leave her alone. Whether she has done or will ever do any of this doesn't matter; that's her business. Your business is to carry the weight of who you are and how you behaved, and—from where I'm sitting—you've done it.

Now it's time to climb out of all this. Shrug off the familiar shadow, the well-known specter, and show up fully for the person you're with today. Show up for reality. Get out of the “nest of salt” that Kurt Cobain sang about. It's a challenge, a proper one. You risk learning even more about yourself, perhaps (most strangely and terrifyingly) some good stuff. Are you big enough for it?

Betting that you are,

James

In their decision allowing the Trump administration to dismantle the Department of Education, the justices didn't offer one word of reasoning.

The Supreme Court is allowing Donald Trump to dismantle the Department of Education. But it won't say why.

Yesterday—almost exactly a week after the Court lifted a lower court's block on Trump's plans to fire thousands of federal employees—a majority of the justices decided to give the president the go-ahead for a different set of mass layoffs. Last week, the Court provided a handful of sentences that vaguely gestured at why it might have allowed the administration to move forward. This week, it offered nothing at all. There's something taunting, almost bullying, about this lack of reasoning, as if the conservative supermajority is saying to the country: You don't even deserve an explanation.

Whereas last week's case involved orders to lay off employees from across the entire federal government, this week's involves just the Education Department. Over the course of his 2024 campaign and in the first few months of his second term, Trump repeatedly announced his plans to close the agency. The department was “a big con job,” he told reporters in February, and he would “like to close it immediately.” In March, Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced plans to cut the department's workforce in half. Trump followed up with an executive order mandating that McMahon “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.”

There was one minor problem with this plan: The executive branch, at least theoretically, did not have the unilateral authority to abolish the Education Department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979. A coalition of states, school districts, and unions sued, and a federal district court temporarily blocked the administration from moving forward. That court order required the department to rehire employees already laid off, pointing to both the Constitution and a statutory prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” actions by federal agencies.

David A. Graham: What does the Department of Education actually do?

In that lower court, the government argued that it sought only to improve the “efficiency” and “accountability” of the department through “reorganization,” but District Judge Myong J. Joun was unconvinced. “A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” he wrote. An appeals court upheld Joun's ruling, freezing Trump's plans while the district court continued to weigh the underlying legal questions.

At this point—stop me if you've heard this one before—the Supreme Court stepped in. Despite a frustrated dissent from the Court's three liberal justices, the majority's unsigned emergency ruling allowed Trump to carry out his plans while the litigation in the lower courts continues. “The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “but either way the threat to our Constitution's separation of powers is grave.” She went on: “The President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them.”

The odd protocol of the Court's emergency docket—sometimes called the “shadow docket”—means that the underlying question of whether Trump has the legal authority to tear apart the Education Department remains unresolved, even as a majority of the justices have allowed him to carry out his plans. Courts—even the Supreme Court—could still find the department's dismantling illegal down the road. But in the meantime, the agency will have been devastated, perhaps irreparably. Layoffs will dramatically reduce the staffing of the already overworked Office of Civil Rights, which is responsible for ensuring equal access to education, including for disabled students. The administration will eviscerate the office responsible for helping students with financial aid for higher education; the government has said that this portion of the agency's portfolio will be shifted over to the Treasury Department, but what this will look like in practice is unclear. The cuts will almost erase the Institute for Education Science, which publishes authoritative data on American schools and has already missed key deadlines this year.

Given the potentially devastating effects of the Supreme Court's ruling on congressionally mandated programs, it's all the more galling that the majority didn't bother to provide even a cursory explanation of its thinking. This terseness has become common as the Court has scaled up its use of emergency rulings—rulings that, it's hard not to notice, have a striking tendency to align with the Trump administration's priorities. Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and an authority on the shadow docket, tallied the Education Department order as the 15th since early April in which the Court has granted Trump emergency relief, and the seventh in which the justices have provided not a word of explanation. (Until recently, the shadow docket was used far more rarely, and only for truly urgent matters.) Do the conservative justices feel that the president really does have the legal authority to destroy a Cabinet department on his own? Or perhaps they believe that the plaintiffs lacked the ability to bring the case at all in federal court? Maybe the reason was something else altogether. There's no way to know.

This silence is damaging, both to the legitimacy of the Court and to the rule of law. The judiciary is a branch of government that is meant to provide reasons for its actions—to explain, both to litigants and to the public, why judges have done what they have done. This is part of what distinguishes law from the raw exercise of power, and what anchors the courts as a component of a democratic system rather than setting them apart as unaccountable sages. With a written opinion, people can evaluate the justices' reasoning for themselves. Without it, they are left to puzzle over the Court's thinking like ancients struggling to decipher the wrath of gods in the scattering of entrails.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Russia is staring down a long-term economic threat that could outlast both the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions: a deepening demographic crisis.

On Tuesday, Labor Minister Anton Kotyakov underscored the scale of the problem during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.

""Today, according to our estimates, by 2030 we need to involve 10.9 million people in the economy,"" Kotyakov told Putin, according to a post from the Kremlin.

Kotyakov said the number is required to replace 10.1 million people who will reach retirement age, and 800,000 new jobs.

Kotyakov warned that if productivity growth falls short of the assumptions built into the current forecast, there could be ""an additional shortage of personnel.""

The remarks came during a Kremlin meeting focused on demographics and healthcare. Members of Putin's cabinet discussed efforts to boost birth rates, including financial incentives like cash payouts and tax breaks for large families.

Putin has made population growth a national priority, calling it a matter of ""ethnic survival"" and encouraging women to have as many as eight children.

In 2024, births in Russia fell to 1.22 million — the lowest level since 1999 — while deaths increased by 3.3% to 1.82 million, according to official data. The country's population was about 146 million last year.

But boosting birth rates isn't Russia's only challenge. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated labor shortages, with battlefield injuries and deaths cutting into the working-age population and a brain drain pulling younger, educated professionals out of the country.

The demographic outlook is so bleak that the country's population could halve by the end of this century, per a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, in August.

Businesses are already feeling the heat. Employers are increasingly turning to retirees and even teenagers to fill roles.

The labor shortage has driven up wages and fueled inflation, adding strain to an economy already distorted by wartime spending.

By the end of 2023, Russia's economy was running so hot that the central bank warned of overheating.

The momentum may be fading.

Just last month, Russia's economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, warned that the country was ""on the brink"" of a recession.

Trump has dubbed the central bank chair “Too Late,” but the data proves otherwise.

Right on time.

Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg 

President Donald Trump has taken to routinely maligning Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as “too late” because interest rates have been on hold at 4.25%-4.5% since he took office. On Tuesday alone, he characteristically took to social media to demand three percentage points of rate cuts — something that is never going to happen outside of a recession. Trump's needling aside, the latest inflation data show that Powell's wait-and-see approach is the exact right tack for today's economic outlook.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday that the core consumer price index rose 0.2% in June from a month earlier, a slightly encouraging surprise that leaves the year-over-year rate at 2.9%. But the reading remains well above the Fed's 2% target1, and the details of the report show that tariffs are starting to fan higher prices and that larger effects might start to feed through over the next couple of months.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Several cryptocurrency regulation bills backed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives, dealing a major blow to the crypto industry.

The final vote on the rule was 196-223, with 13 Republicans voting with Democrats to block the procedural motion. The measure cannot move forward until the House approves the rule, which governs debate for legislation.

The vote, during what is being billed as ""Crypto Week,"" was a rare instance of House Republicans refusing to take direction from Trump. The measures had been widely expected to pass.

House leadership tentatively plans to hold another vote later Tuesday to try to advance the legislation.

It was unclear whether the second vote would be for an identical rule and the same bills, or whether House Republican leaders would make changes to the package to satisfy GOP caucus members who opposed the motion.

Crypto-linked stocks turned lower after the vote failed.

Shares of the stablecoin company Circle dropped more than 7% on the news, while Coinbase fell more than 4%. Shares of the digital asset firm MARA Holdings dipped more than 2%.

One of the three bills in limbo after the failed vote is the GENIUS Act, which passed the Senate last month with some Democratic support. The GENIUS Act seeks to regulate stablecoins.

Another bill, the CLARITY Act, would establish rules for whether an asset is regulated as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission or as a commodity overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The third proposal would prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of the Republicans who opposed the measure, wrote in a post on, ""I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments to the GENIUS Act.""

""President Trump included a ban on CBDC in his January 23rd executive order and Congress must also include the ban on CBDC in the GENIUS Act,"" Greene wrote.

Trump had hailed ""Crypto Week"" during a post on his Truth Social earlier Tuesday and urged all House Republicans to vote ""yes"" on the measure.

""The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets - Nobody does it better!"" Trump wrote.

""The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,"" he wrote.

""Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!),"" Trump continued.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Fairshake, the cryptocurrency industry's most powerful political action committee, announced Tuesday that it now holds more than $141 million in cash on hand, underscoring the sector's growing influence as Congress takes up landmark legislation this week.

The total, which includes liquid assets like crypto, stock, and cash, reflects a surge of donations from digital asset executives and firms, including a fresh $25 million from Coinbase.

Fairshake and its two affiliated PACs — Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress — have raised $109 million since Election Day in 2024 and $52 million during just the first half of this year.

""We are building an aggressive, targeted strategy for next year to ensure that pro-crypto voices are heard in key races across the country,"" said spokesperson Josh Vlasto.

The announcement lands in the middle of what lawmakers are calling ""Crypto Week"" on Capitol Hill, as the House begins deliberations on a trio of long-awaited bills that would define how digital assets are regulated.

The legislation includes the dividing of oversight, setting new stablecoin rules, and a bill banning the creation of a central bank digital currency.

The crypto industry is no longer just lobbying for survival, it is shaping the political landscape. Fairshake saw nearly every candidate it backed in 2024 win their race.

""We stuck to our core strategy from Day 1,"" Fairshake previously told CNBC. ""We supported pro-crypto candidates and opposed those who played politics with jobs and innovation, and won.""

If there is one thing the U.S. needs to lead the artificial intelligence revolution, it's electricity. Insane amounts of it.

A 2024 report commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy found that data centers — the backbone of artificial intelligence — already accounted for more than 4% of U.S. electricity use, and the report said that could grow to 12% by 2028. That would be 580 billion kilowatt hours, or nearly 20 times the annual power consumption of the city of Chicago.

""Data centers run 24/7, and need to be able to support the needs of our users,"" said Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers for Meta. The parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp has announced a massive push into AI.

""We use a lot of power. We need to make sure we have a robust grid,"" she said.

Meta is not alone, say economic development experts.

""The big issues right now are deliverability of sites,"" said Tom Stringer, a principal and leader of the site selection and incentives practice at Grassi Advisors in New York. ""And maybe the biggest component of that is adequate power.""

The deals keep coming. On Tuesday, Google announced it would spend $25 billion to develop data centers along the nation's largest multi-state grid, an electricity region covering 13 states in all. Meanwhile. CoreWeave announced a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania.

CNBC considers each state's electrical grid in our annual competitiveness study, America's Top States for Business. Under the study's methodology, we use U.S. Department of Energy data on grid reliability — the duration of power outages per year — as well as the retail price of electricity.

With a wealth of inexpensive, reliable electricity, these states are the best equipped to power the AI revolution, and everything else.

The power grid in Washington — and across the Pacific Northwest — faces no shortage of challenges. While demand grows, climate change is intensifying the storms that batter the area every year and threatening the consistency of hydroelectric power, an important source for the region. But so far, the state is meeting the demand at a reasonable price.

Largest electric utility: Puget Sound Energy

Power outages statewide: 2.53 hours/year (2023)

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $10.16/kWh (2024)

Power from renewable sources: 10.2%

New Mexico is the seventh largest generator of wind energy, according to the Energy Department, and it is seeking to increase the use of other alternative sources like solar power to meet relentless demand. The state is also seeking to modernize its grid with tools like smart meters that will help the state better coordinate supply and demand.

Largest electric utility: Public Service Company of New Mexico

Power outages statewide: 2.82 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.30/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 59.6%

Montana is home to the Western end of the North Plains Connector, a 420-mile, 525-kilovolt-transmission line that will connect the Eastern and Western U.S. electrical grids for the first time. The $3.2 billion project, funded in part by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, aims to make the grid more resilient and responsive to demand, with the ability to move electricity in either direction between Montana and North Dakota. The project is in the permitting phase, with construction expected to begin in 2028, and electricity expected to begin flowing in 2032.

Largest electric utility: NorthWestern Energy

Power outages statewide: 1.98 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $10.84/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 25.1%

North Dakotans enjoy the cheapest electricity of any state — roughly 30% cheaper than in neighboring Minnesota. One reason, the U.S. Department of Energy says, is that the state has abundant supplies of coal and natural gas, and a small population. That allows the state to produce far more energy than it consumes. But the state also boasts the most abundant wind energy resources in the nation, and it is rich in other renewable sources like biomass. In all, North Dakota generates about one-third of its power from renewable sources, and efforts are underway to increase that. EmPower North Dakota, an agency created by the state legislature in 2007, aims to diversify the state's grid beyond fossil fuels.

Largest electric utility: Xcel Energy

Power outages statewide: 3.48 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $8.00/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 34.7%

Idaho was early to the data center sweepstakes, landing Meta's massive Kuna data center back in 2022. The roughly 1-million-square-foot facility is expected to begin operations next year. To fulfill Meta's promise that the center will run on 100% renewable energy, the company is helping to develop a 200-megawatt solar facility nearby. But Idaho is also rich in other renewable sources, most notably hydroelectric power. Idaho is also one of the only states capable of generating significant amounts of electricity through geothermal power.

Largest electric utility: Idaho Power (IDACORP)

Power outages statewide: 2.29 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.52/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 29%

South Dakota is meeting the voracious demand for energy with a heavy reliance on renewables — especially wind, which accounts for 55% of the state's electricity generation, according to the Energy Department. The only state more reliant on wind is Iowa. The Energy Department notes that wind power surpassed hydropower in South Dakota for the first time in 2021. By 2023, wind energy had surged to three times as much electricity generation as hydropower. All the while, South Dakota has maintained one of the most reliable grids in the nation.

Largest electric utility: Xcel Energy

Power outages statewide: 1.28 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $11/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 62.5%

While coal still accounts for nearly half of Utah's electricity generation, that is down sharply from 75% a decade ago, according to the Energy Department. The Utah Office of Energy Development says its Strategic Energy Plan differs from energy policies in many other states because it prioritizes the human consequences of its actions.

""While other states enact energy policies focused on energy resources and emissions, Utah is focused on ensuring our citizens maintain their standard of living and have the chance to thrive,"" the office's website says.

The policy aims to double the state's power production by 2025, while keeping costs affordable, increasing efficiency, and protecting the environment.

Largest electric utility: Rocky Mountain Power – a division of Berkshire Hathaway's PacifiCorp

Power outages statewide: 2.12 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.03/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 32%

Wyoming is coal country — home to about one-third of the nation's recoverable coal reserves, according to the Energy Department. So, it should come as no surprise that coal-fired power plants produce around three-quarters of Wyoming's electricity, more than any state except West Virginia. But that is down from 97% in 2003. Since then, coal's decline as a preferred energy source nationwide has profoundly affected Wyoming's economy. Still, with the smallest population of any state, and all that coal — plus abundant wind, hydroelectric, natural gas and solar power — Wyoming produces far more power than it consumes. That makes for very low costs on a reliable grid.

Largest electric utility: Rocky Mountain Power – a division of Berkshire Hathaway's PacifiCorp

Power outages statewide: 1.99 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.15/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 24.8%

No state gets more of its electricity from wind than Iowa, according to the Energy Department, which says Iowa's power mix has changed rapidly over the past decade or so. Coal, which was dominant until around 2019, now accounts for less than a quarter of the state's electricity production. The state's only nuclear plant, the Duane Arnold Energy Center near Cedar Rapids, ceased operations after sustaining damage in the infamous 2020 derecho. Now, the plant's owner, NextEra Energy Resources, is looking into the possibility of restarting the plant to help meet demand from projects like data centers. But the company is also developing two new solar farms on the site.

Largest electric utility: MidAmerican Energy (Berkshire Hathaway)

Power outages statewide: 1.75 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.43/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 65.6%

Nebraska offers America's most reliable power grid, at among the lowest cost. The Energy Department says Nebraska is the only state in which all electricity providers are owned by the public — either through public power districts, municipal power systems, or rural electric cooperatives. Most of the state's electricity still comes from coal-fired power plants, but the amount of electricity generated by coal is the lowest in a generation.

In May, Gov. Jim Pillen signed legislation placing new restrictions on cryptocurrency mining — another major user of electricity. The law requires miners to contribute to grid improvements, and it allows utilities to require them to shut down during times of peak demand.

Largest electric utility: Nebraska Public Power District

Power outages statewide: 1.21 hours/year

Average retail price of electricity (all sectors): $9.19/kWh

Power from renewable sources: 33.6%

In this article

Apple and miner MP Materials announced a $500 million deal Tuesday for rare earth magnets and the development of a recycling facility that will reinforce the iPhone maker's U.S. supply chain.

MP Materials stock climbed 20%. Shares of Apple were marginally higher.

As part of the agreement, Apple will buy rare earth magnets created at the company's facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Both companies will combine on a new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. MP Materials plans to start shipping magnets in 2027.

""American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we're proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. ""Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States."".

Apple said the deal will create dozens of new manufacturing and research and development roles.

Rare earth magnets are key components that make up everything from consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers to cars and renewable energy systems.

For years, the U.S. has worked on curbing its reliance on China, which dominates the global rare earth elements supply chain. MP Materials operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S.

Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner, buying $400 million in preferred stock to improve rare earth magnet supply on American soil.

Apple announced a plan to invest more than $500 billion to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities earlier this year. The plan included a new factory for artificial intelligence servers in Texas.

Shares of MP Materials have nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, pushing the miner's market capitalization to nearly $10 billion. The stock has nearly doubled over the last month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday as worries over U.S. inflation and a mixed bag of big bank earnings dragged the blue-chip index lower. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a boost from gains in Nvidia.

The 30-stock Dow lost 436.36 points, or 0.98%, and closed at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 lost 0.40% and closed at 6,243.76, easing from a fresh record high reached earlier in the session. The Nasdaq was an outperformer, adding 0.18% and posting a record close of 20,677.80. The tech-heavy index was aided by a 4% rise in Nvidia shares after the chip company said it hopes to ""soon"" resume deliveries of its H20 GPU sales to China. 

June inflation data released Tuesday represented an increase from May levels, despite the headline numbers matching expectations. The consumer price index increased 0.3% on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, matching a consensus poll from Dow Jones. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew 0.2% month over month, slightly less than expected. Year over year, it expanded by 2.9%, matching estimates.

The print spurred fears about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1.

""The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June,"" said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury.

""While there was a mild miss in the core number, both the main and underlying inflation measures are now printing at their highest levels in four months. The big fear for Fed officials is that stormier waters lie ahead, as not only is there a time lag between the tariffs and an increase to prices, but additional tariff hikes on 1st August would almost certainly herald further inflationary pressures ahead,"" Ryan added.

Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report coming in-line with expectations, but that ""it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming.""

On the earnings front, reports from several financial heavyweights failed to impress investors.

Wells Fargo beat earnings, but a reduction in net interest income guidance sent shares lower by more than 5%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged lower even though the bank posted better-than-expected second-quarter results driven by strong trading and investment banking revenue. Asset manager BlackRock slipped nearly 6% on a quarterly revenue miss.

Citigroup bucked the negative trend in financials, rising more than 3% after the bank topped second-quarter estimates.

Wall Street is hoping that the second-quarter earnings season will boost a stock market that's already near all-time highs. Expectations are low ahead of the reports, however. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. That would be mark the lowest growth rate for the index going back to the fourth quarter of 2023.

The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% on Tuesday to close at 6,243.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 436.36 points, or 0.98%, ending at 44,023.29.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the only bright spot in Tuesday's market. The Nasdaq rose 0.18% to settle the session at 20,677.80.

Several crypto-related legislative measures failed to beat a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.

The vote came in at 196 to 223, with 13 Republican lawmakers siding with Democrats to block the procedural motion.

The vote comes after President Donald Trump encouraged Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of the measure. ""The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets – Nobody does it better!"" he wrote on Truth Social earlier Tuesday.

Crypto-linked stocks traded lower, with Circle Internet Group dropping 4% and Coinbase Global losing 1%. Bitcoin also slipped below the $117,000 threshold, dropping more than 2% on the day.

Shares of Southwest Airlines could be set to take a breather, according to Evercore ISI.

The firm downgraded Southwest Airlines stock to in line from outperform on Tuesday, alongside a $40 per share price target. Evercore's forecast implies roughly 6% upside from Monday's $37.70 close. The stock has gained about 11% so far in 2025.

""Southwest is in the process of implementing numerous logical changes which should help its lagging margins begin to recover by 4Q25. Trading at 36x '25E, 11x '26E EPS, we believe shares are now much closer to fair value and are beginning to more fully price in clean execution of these initiatives into next year,"" analyst Duane Pfennigwerth wrote.

A social media analysis shows consumers are lovin' McDonald's new menu item, according to Wolfe Research.

""We think excitement for Snack Wraps ... positively contributed to brand buzz/momentum to start 3Q,"" Greg Badishkanian, head of the firm's consumer team, wrote to clients in a Tuesday note. ""But are waiting to see what happens after initial trial.""

The fast food giant brought its chicken wrap back to menus last week after originally being discontinued in 2016. Badishkanian said social media checks and industry conversations imply the item is doing well so far.

Badishkanian also said the product should perform better than McCrispy strips, another new release, given what he called pent-up excitement and because of the fact that it was a prior fan favorite.

McDonald's shares ticked lower in Tuesday session, putting a four-day win streak at risk. Shares have risen more than 3.5% in 2025.

— Alex Harring

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Tuesday that he would buy his own stock, which was down more than 5% on the heels of the asset manager's weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter.

""They think our expenses may be too high, and our expenses are all front loaded,"" Fink said on ""Money Movers."" ""But I'm thrilled where we are. I'm thrilled about our position with our clients.""

""Long term, I'm a huge buyer of BlackRock at these prices,"" he continued.

Fink also called the artificial intelligence infrastructure opportunity for BlackRock ""enormous"" and said that he believes infrastructure investing is ""at the beginning of a golden age.""

Jefferies is stepping to the sidelines on DoorDash following its recent outperformance.

Shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after analyst John Colantuoni downgraded shares of the food delivery company to hold from buy. His updated price target implies slight upside of about 3% from Monday's close.

This comes as the stock has jumped almost 42% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of more than 6%.

""Our profit decomposition supports upside to cons and peer-leading EBITDA growth, but likely not enough to justify continued outperformance without assigning optimistic multiples to DASH's non-core businesses,"" the analyst wrote. ""We also think a recent ramp in affordability initiatives could limit upside to take rate.""

""With the stock up 45% YTD and valuation at a 120% premium to Internet, we downgrade to Hold given DASH's strong execution and growth algorithm appear fully reflected,"" he continued.

While Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally remains optimistic that the Trump administration will come to a negotiated tariff deal that will be a positive for automakers, he is cautious on Tesla. ""We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL,"" he wrote, citing several factors for his concern.

McNally said ""long-term negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated,"" with fiscal 2026 earnings per share on pace to be about 85% lower than 2022 predictions. He's also worried about a disappointing autonomous vehicle rollout, ""divisive political posting,"" and technical moves in the stock that are on the edge of turning negative. Tesla stock has fallen more than 21% year to date, but was slightly positive in Tuesday's session.

In the near term, McNally said he is expecting second-quarter profits in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents per share, which is below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 44 cents.

The S&P 500 has posted 55 days above its 20-day moving average, the longest such streak going back to January 2021 when it was 56 days, according to BTIG. The 20-day moving average, which indicates short-term trends, is at around 6,144. 

The long streak is a bullish long-term signal for the stock market, suggesting the S&P 500 can continue to climb higher now that it's back to trading around all-time highs. But, over the near term, it suggests the broad market is due for a pullback.  

""We are clearly stretching the limits of time without a 20 DMA break, and former such streaks often led to periods of volatility or consolidation,"" BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky wrote Monday. 

""We think at a minimum we see a test of ~6144 as we head into the back-half of July as volatility enters a a seasonally strong period, and likely something closer to the 6k level heading into August,"" he added.

Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials jumped more than 25% Tuesday on a $500 million deal to supply Apple with magnets that are manufactured at a plant in Texas.

MP will provide Apple with rare earth magnets made from recycled materials at its Independence plant in Forth Worth. The input materials come from end-of-life magnets, the miner said.

The deal comes after MP announced last week that the Pentagon was purchasing a direct equity stake, sending the miner's shares skyrocketing about 50%.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, following an inflation report that showed prices rising but mostly in line with market expectations.

""Consumer Prices LOW. Bring down the Fed Rate, NOW!!!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social site.

In a separate post, Trump called for a 3 percentage point reduction.

""Fed should cut Rates by 3 Points. Very Low Inflation. One Trillion Dollars a year would be saved!!!"" he said.

The statements followed a report showing the consumer price index in June rose 0.3%, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation also moved higher, rising 0.2%, with a 2.9% annual rate.

Factory activity in the New York area surged in July, posting its first positive reading since February as shipments, inventory and employment grew and optimism for the future also improved, according to the regional Federal Reserve

The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing index jumped to 5.5, a nearly 22-point improvement over the prior month and much better than the -9.5 forecast from Dow Jones. The gauge measures the percentage difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction.

Within the index, new orders surged 16.2 points to positive level, while shipments soared 18.7 points to 11.5 and inventories climbed 14.7 points to 15.6. The prices paid index accelerated but the prices received index nudged lower while the employment index also improved, rising to 9.2, up 4.5 points from June.

Looking to the future, the general business conditions outlook for six months down the road improved to 24.1, or a 2.9-point gain.

Just last week, Wall Street firm Stephens predicted that The Trade Desk could be a potential contender to join the S&P 500's communications services sector, which is an underweight grouping in the index.

The Trade Desk will replace software company Ansys, which is on track to be acquired by Synopsys on or about Thursday.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he reached a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that will set a 19% tariff on the southeast Asian country's U.S. exports.

""We will pay no tariffs. So they are giving us access into Indonesia, which we never had,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House.

""That's probably the biggest part of the deal. And the other part is they are going to pay 19%,"" he said.

It was not immediately clear if Jakarta had approved the deal terms as described by Trump. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In a subsequent post on Truth Social, Trump said Indonesia ""has committed to purchasing $15 Billion Dollars in U.S. Energy, $4.5 Billion Dollars in American Agricultural Products, and 50 Boeing Jets, many of them 777's"" as part of the deal.

Indonesian airline Garuda was recently in talks to buy between 50 and 75 Boeing  aircraft, its CEO reportedly said in early July.

If it comes to pass, the new tariff rate on Indonesian imports would show Trump pulling back on the 32% duty he had threatened to impose as recently as last week.

Trump said in a brief social media post Tuesday morning that the agreement followed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

""I spoke to their really great president, very popular, very strong, smart, and we made the deal,"" Trump said at the White House later in the day.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday afternoon that Indonesia would drop its tariffs on U.S. goods as part of the agreement.

""No tariffs there. They pay tariffs here,"" Lutnick said.

The White House did not respond to CNBC's requests for additional information about the purported deal with Indonesia.

Indonesia is one of the United States' top 25 trade partners, with the two countries trading more than $38 billion in goods in 2024, according to the Commerce Department. The U.S. trade deficit with Indonesia totaled $17.9 billion last year.

Trump's post on Indonesia closely resembles his July 2 announcement that the U.S. reached a trade deal with Vietnam.

Trump's initial message about Vietnam was also short on details, though he declared in a follow-up post that the terms included a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports.

Vietnamese officials were reportedly surprised about Trump's description of their preliminary deal with the U.S. As of July 10, the Vietnamese government still has not formally accepted part of the deal Trump touted, Politico reported.

The U.S. has also made a preliminary trade deal with the United Kingdom, and it has reached another agreement with China that allowed both sides to lower the sky-high tariffs on each others' goods.

But Trump has recently eschewed the traditional trade negotiation process, opting instead to send letters to U.S. trade partners that dictate what their new U.S. tariff rate will be starting on Aug. 1.

SharpLink Gaming acquired $225 million worth of Ethereum earlier this month, the company said in a press release on Tuesday, adding to its industry-leading holdings. 

The Minneapolis, Minnesota-based firm now said it now owns roughly 280,000 Ethereum worth $846 million. The company first purchased the asset just over a month ago.

As of Tuesday, the Ethereum Foundation owned around 217,500 Ethereum worth $655 million across several networks, according to crypto analytics platform Arkham Intelligence. The platform shows at least 17 entities holding more Ethereum than SharpLink, but they include smart contracts and exchanges that may not own the Ethereum they control.

SharpLink shares spiked 3.6% to $24.76 on Tuesday, according to Yahoo Finance. As Ethereum's price has climbed above the $3,000 mark, SharpLink's stock price has soared more than 160% over the past month, mirroring the gains of some other Ethereum treasury firms.

Most crypto treasury firms seek to maximize shareholder value by growing the amount of digital assets they own per fully diluted share. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor pioneered a Bitcoin-buying playbook that many firms have sought to emulate this year, but SharpLink's strategy is aimed at leveraging Ethereum's relatively distinct qualities.

This month, SharpLink said that it has so far earned approximately 94 Ethereum worth $283,000 through staking rewards, for example. Over 99% of the company's ETH holdings are allocated to protocols that let it participate in the process of validating Ethereum transactions.

SharpLink said that it also raised $413 million in proceeds from the sale of 24 million common shares, while holding $257 million in cash that has yet to be devoted to the asset.

The company noted that the amount of Ethereum it holds for every 1,000 assumed diluted shares outstanding, or SharpLink's “ETH concentration,” has increased to 2.46 Ethereum from 2 Ethereum, a 23% increase compared to 32 days ago.

The company's stock plunged last month moments after a registration-of-shares filing became effective, similar to Solana treasury firm Upexi. SharpLink shares had soared as high as $124 before the collapse, which stemmed from institutions' profit-taking.

On X, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, who chairs SharpLink's board, described buying pressure from other Ethereum treasury firms as an “industrial shop vacuum” mopping up Ethereum's excess supply so “supply-demand dynamics are tightly balanced.”

On Monday, Bitcoin miner BitMine said that it had recently raised $250 million through a private placement to buy Ethereum. The company's board is being led by Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner and Head of Research Tom Lee.

“Count me as a member,” Lee said on X on Monday, responding to a metaphorical hat tip from Lubin, who called himself a “self-appointed representative of The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen.”

Articles Details

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Altcoins have recently shown a significant surge, marking a potential new beginning for the cryptocurrency market. This resurgence is particularly notable as Ethereum has surged past the $3,000 mark, breaking out of a six-year consolidation phase. This breakout is reminiscent of the February-March 2024 period when Ethereum experienced a significant gain following a similar surge. The total crypto market cap has jumped, as investors rotate into altcoins, especially those with strong staking mechanics like Ethereum. This shift in capital from Bitcoin to altcoins indicates that the market may be entering an altcoin season, where altcoins outperform Bitcoin.

The Ethereum supply locked has hit a new all-time high, further signaling a strong resurgence in momentum. This is supported by a rare bullish crossover on Ethereum's moving averages, typically seen during major rallies, potentially signaling the end of the crypto winter. The market is in the early stages of altcoin season, with key indicators flashing breakout signals and market momentum rising. This is evident in the performance of veteran altcoins, which have shown impressive gains. Stellar (XLM), ranked 12th by market cap, has a weekly gain of 82%, leading among similar assets. ADA, ranked 10th by market cap, has a weekly gain of nearly 30%; Ripple (XRP) 29%; Dogecoin (DOGE) 18%. Some newer altcoins, such as the L1 project Sei (SEI) and the synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA), have also shown impressive gains, with weekly increases exceeding 30%.

The collective strength of veteran altcoins is interpreted as an early signal of retail funds possibly flowing back. These tokens represent cryptocurrencies that have existed for a longer time and have larger market capitalizations, and their activity often reflects retail market participation and funding preferences. The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), is entering the ""Banana Zone 2.0,"" which typically indicates that after a period of consolidation, the market will enter a phase of explosive breakout. This suggests that the altcoin market may no longer be merely speculative frenzy but rather driven by fundamentals and institutional funding for more sustainable growth.

The altcoin season index stands at 32/100, still far from the 75-point threshold, indicating that the market remains in a Bitcoin-dominated phase. However, the index has recently shown a positive upward trend, suggesting that early signs of rotation are emerging. Key signals for the arrival of altcoin season include strengthening dominance of altcoins, rapid price increases, and FOMO sentiment and retail frenzy. The decline in Bitcoin dominance is an important feature of the current market, with altcoins beginning to perform widely, indicating that institutional and retail investors may be diversifying their funds into alternative digital assets.

The launch of spot ETFs, advances in Layer 2 (L2) solutions, the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, the development of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and the improvement of blockchain gaming infrastructure have all brought new value narratives and application prospects to altcoins, providing fundamental support. Therefore, while it remains to be seen how long the ""mini altcoin season"" can last, the positive signals released by the market indicate that investors are re-embracing risk, injecting much-needed vitality into the market.

Bitcoin's price has seen a decline of nearly 3%, while Ethereum experienced a 2.5% increase. This follows Bitcoin's rapid pullback from its all-time high of over $123,000. The drop is attributed to several factors, including a $10 billion whale sale, newly announced tariffs, inflation data, and geopolitical threats. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's resilience offers motivation for altcoin enthusiasts. An analyst and investor known as Evanss6 suggests that the time for change might have arrived. The primary reason being the recent, genuine reversal signal in the ETHBTC pair, an occurrence not seen for a prolonged period. “ETH continues to trade below the levels seen when ETFs were released, which seems incorrect. For the first time in over a year, ETHBTC has risen above the 200-day moving average. Several significant changes have occurred since then. For example, Grayscale's surplus supply has been eliminated. Ethereum has secured Saylor through Sharplink/Lubin. The Ethereum Foundation has undergone significant changes. The Trump administration canceled OCP2.0.”

If ETH begins to strengthen, this signals a potential rise for altcoins as well. The reversal in the ETHBTC pair is crucial, yet it must be sustained. The transition from over 1,000 days of negativity impacts all altcoins. As seen in previous altcoin bull runs, ETH's lead is vital as it paves the way for others, with altcoins potentially shadowing ETH as it approaches its all-time high. Negotiations regarding tariffs will continue until August 1, with the Fed's interest rate decision expected at the end of the month. Currently, negative factors like tariff letters are not hindering Ether's progress. Given that major developments are clustered towards the end of the month, ETH has a chance to approach $3,500. Hence, altcoins might experience notable increases over the next two weeks. The markets are set to be active again in August, and unless tariffs are further delayed, they will be absorbed by the markets. The extent, or even presence, of a drop remains uncertain. However, by September, the expectation is a renewed interest in altcoins due to potential altcoin ETF approvals, potentially priced in by the market earlier.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","U.S. Bank begins testing a blockchain for trade finance","https://www.americanbanker.com/news/u-s-bank-begins-testing-trade-finance-blockchain","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 20:00:00 GMT","

U.S. Bank has completed its first fully digital trade finance transaction as financial institutions move away from paper-based processes for international trade.

The national bank worked with the blockchain-based WaveBL platform, which supports encrypted digital document transfers between trade partners and their banks, to facilitate the trade transaction.

""It was a collective effort to join forces and pilot this right for this client of ours,"" Daniel Son, head of working capital finance at U.S. Bank, told American Banker. ""If you want to do something digital, you need to make sure that all the parties within the underlying trade transaction are enabled to deliver, send and accept these digital transactions.""

U.S. Bank served as the presenting bank for an undisclosed exporter already working with WaveBL, according to Son. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company issued the electronic bill of lading and facilitated the shipment, and the India-based bank ICICI Bank processed the other side of the transaction.

Ofer Ein Bar, vice president of financial solutions at WaveBL, said partners like U.S. Bank ""bring us closer to achieving our mission to provide practical solutions that streamline trade finance transactions and enable meaningful industry advancements. This is only the beginning.""

Blockchain technologies carry the benefit of common systems between parties, but only work efficiently when every party member involved in the transaction is on the same chain, according to Finzly CEO Booshan Rengachari.

The concept of using blockchains in trade finance has existed for years, but applying a single blockchain across the entire industry is impractical, according to Rengachari.

""Every major bank in every country has had some proof of concept for building these trade finance transactions digitally for more than 10-15 years,"" he said. ""The problem is, can every bank get on the same chain? If you look at some major banks, they're not on a single core platform. They don't have a common ledger. In these proofs of concept, the major banks have their own private chain that nobody else is using. Can we really bring all of these banks together into one common ledger or one common blockchain? Technically it is possible, but practically it is not possible.""

However, Rengachari pointed out there are a few potential workarounds. ""It could be a chain of chains, or there could be one common agency, a global agency that connects multiple chains and makes them interoperate from one to another,"" Rengachari said. 

He added that distributed ledgers could help the trade industry unlock the broader benefits of document digitization.

""Digitization brings a lot of benefits to fast-tracking payments, collecting taxes and tariffs and fast-tracking transportation of documents, but the key is bringing every party of the transaction to the same chain,"" Rengachari said.

Javelin research director James Wester, research director for digital assets and crypto at Javelin Strategy, also told American Banker that incorporating blockchain into trade finance workflows has been attempted before.

""Prior efforts were shuttered after failing to gain traction,"" he said. ""Those attempts showed just how hard it is to achieve the alignment required across the entire trade finance value chain.""

One obstacle to full document digitization is differences in legal requirements and regulations across the supply chain, according to Wester.

""The industry remains paper-heavy because physical documents still carry the necessary legal weight across multiple jurisdictions,"" he said. ""A blockchain-backed digital document only works if regulators, customs, financial institutions and all counterparties agree to recognize it. That alignment is finally starting to happen, and the U.S. Bank story shows how players across the value chain are beginning to embed digital documents into real-world workflows.""

International trade transactions usually require a courier to physically transport documents across continents, which can take several days. According to U.S. Bank, fully digitizing the trade transaction documents reduced that part of the timeline to minutes. This translates into direct cost savings for banks, according to Son.

""When you're no longer having to send physical documents back and forth, then you don't have courier expenses anymore,"" he said. ""Digital costs a fraction of courier costs, especially when there's a mistake that you have to correct and then resend the documents back and forth.""

Son also highlighted the indirect cost savings for banks when switching to fully digital trade documents.

""There's a risk mitigation component to digital versus paper,"" he said. ""Covid is the best example from recent years, since post offices and couriers were shut down. How do you actually deliver documents during a time of pandemic? What about geopolitical issues? When you're working with physical documents, you're subject to those disruptions.""

""Just like misdelivered packages, sometimes it goes to the wrong address or the wrong party,"" Son said. ""In some cases that's fine as it just gets rerouted, but in most cases that could be extremely damaging from a data privacy and reputation standpoint, not to mention enormous delays. All of that is a pretty big incentive to move these documents more through digital channels.""

Tariffs are a hot topic in U.S. regulation at present, but experts note that the shipping industry has been navigating various changing trade policies for many years already.

""One benefit of a digital framework is that it gives every participant in the trade ecosystem better visibility and control, especially during moments of disruption caused by tariffs or sanctions,"" Wester said. ""But tariffs and sanctions have existed long before digital recordkeeping, so whether today's trade environment will accelerate adoption remains to be seen.""

The trend of document digitization is picking up speed across the trading and shipping industry. The Digital Container Shipping Association, a trade group that includes nine of the world's ten largest container lines, has committed to issuing 100% electronic bills of lading by 2030. A bill of lading is one of the most important documents in the trade transaction process — it is used as a receipt of goods, a contract between the shipper and carrier and a document of title. Currently, the bill of lading is often still reliant on the physical transfer of paper records via courier.

A co-signed commitment statement published by the DCSA states that ""electronic bill[s] of lading could save customers $6.5 billion in direct costs and enable $30-40 billion in annual global trade growth. Likewise, digitizing these processes would substantially benefit the environment by removing the need for physical documents and associated transportation.""

Luke Pettit, a Senate Banking Committee staffer, will serve as the Treasury Department's next assistant secretary of financial institutions.

The Minneapolis-based bank worked with WaveBL and ICICI Bank to handle an export shipment with fully digital documents via blockchain technology.

The Federal Reserve governor said the uptick in buy now pay later repayment issues is likely a sign that consumers don't understand the terms of the emerging credit offering.

The agency unveiled several deregulatory measures at a Tuesday board meeting, including a measure to tie regulatory thresholds to inflation, one creating a supervisory appeals office that reports to the board and withdrawal of a Biden-era rule on industrial loan companies.

CEO Robin Vince refused to comment on ""rumors or speculation"" about a potential merger between the custody banking giant and its smaller rival, Northern Trust. He also said that the bar for BNY to engage in M&A is ""very high.""

Pakistan's governance system faces a range of persistent issues that continue to undermine public trust and efficiency. Inaccurate or missing identity records leave millions without access to basic services, while outdated paper-based systems in healthcare and legal institutions lead to lost records, delays and mismanagement. Elections are frequently marred by allegations of fraud, low transparency and limited access for overseas voters, raising doubts about their legitimacy.

Corruption remains a deeply entrenched problem, with opaque financial systems allowing for the misuse of public funds and limited accountability. In late 2018, officials in the federal Finance Ministry removed a critical dissent note from a document outlining Rs1.253 trillion in contingent liabilities. From land disputes caused by poorly maintained property records to the misallocation of subsidies and development budgets, administrative inefficiencies affect both the credibility of public institutions and the quality of life for citizens. These are not isolated issues, they are interconnected challenges that demand systemic reform.

In recent years, blockchain technology has evolved from a platform just for cryptocurrency into something way more versatile with numerous applications. Blockchain is like a digital notebook that keeps a record of transactions. But instead of being kept in one place, it's shared across many computers around the world. Blockchain has certain key features that have played a vital role in its growing popularity. Some features are:

Decentralisation: Blockchain doesn't require the approval of regulatory authority such as a government or a bank to go forward with transactions, but rather the consensus of the users. This results in a smoother, more efficient system for transactions.

Immutability: Once data has been added to the ledger, it's nearly impossible to change.

Transparency: Most blockchains are public, making the transaction history visible and transparent for anyone who wishes to view it.

Governments around the world are increasingly adopting blockchain technology to power large-scale systems such as voting, healthcare and digital identity verification. Countries like the UAE, Estonia, Sweden and the UK, as well as several developing nations, have already begun integrating blockchain into their public infrastructure to enhance transparency, security and efficiency. So we may ask, should Pakistan follow the same direction?

Blockchain technology can be used to address Pakistan's real-time administration problems and revolutionise governance and public services across multiple domains. In Digital Identity and Citizen Records, it can enable the issuance of secure, tamper-proof digital IDs in partnership with NADRA. For E-voting, blockchain can be utilised to conduct secure and transparent elections, significantly reducing the possibility of electoral fraud while also facilitating easier voting for overseas Pakistanis.

In Healthcare and Medical Records, blockchain allows patient data to be securely stored and shared between hospitals, which is especially beneficial during emergency situations where immediate access to medical history is crucial. Similarly, for Financial Records, it may help prevent corruption and malpractices by making the financial data of government officials publicly accessible and immutable.

While many Pakistan's administrative issues can be dealt with through blockchain technologies, it also offers several other potential economic social benefits:

Adopting blockchain technology in Pakistan holds significant potential for economic and social advancement. In terms of attracting foreign investments, taking a major step into blockchain and digital development positions Pakistan as a promising hub for technological innovation, an emerging market and a forward-thinking digital economy.

Additionally, creating jobs through the growth of a blockchain sector would open up a wide range of high-demand careers for Pakistan's youth, including roles in software development, blockchain engineering, cybersecurity, data analysis and digital infrastructure. Furthermore, enhancing trust in governance is another critical benefit, as blockchain's inherent transparency can help restore and strengthen public confidence in government institutions.

Despite its benefits, blockchain technology isn't without its fair share of hurdles. Its encrypted, immutable nature makes data changes nearly impossible, which ensures security but can also lock in mistakes or fraud if not properly verified. The high cost of implementation and maintenance is also a major concern, especially in countries like Pakistan. Public concern intensified when the Minister for Crypto & Blockchain, Bilal Bin Saqib, announced allocation of 2,000 MW of electricity for crypto miners, sparking criticism over energy prioritisation in a country already facing power shortages.

To mitigate these risks, Pakistan should take a cautious, phased approach before adopting blockchain impulsively without much thought.

Pumpfun Raises $500M in 12 Minutes, But Who Really Got In?

The Solana memecoin factory just pulled off one of the largest and fastest ICOs in recent history. If their ambitions come to life, we could be witnessing one of a few times when everyday users, not just private investors, have a chance to participate in the upside (even if those users were mostly whales).

In just 12 minutes on July 12, pumpfun raised $500 million in a public sale of its native token, PUMP, selling 125 billion tokens at $0.004 each, or 12.5% of the planned 1 trillion total supply.

The sale is the fifth-largest in ICO history, if you actually believe Nicolas Maduro raised $735M for his Petro token. Setting aside Petro, only EOS managed to raise more via a public token offering, while the Telegram Open Network (TON) and Bitfinex (LEO) raised more, but in private token sales.

Pumpfun has been a memecoin kingmaker on Solana since launching in January 2024. It has facilitated the launch of more than 10 million tokens with zero-code deployment, and raked in almost $700M in fees, according to DeFiLlama.

Solana-based pumpfun has evolved from its early, lawless days as an emerging memecoin launchpad to become one of the most successful crypto platforms out there.

What does the ICO signal? They now have the cash to go after a much larger vision.

Founder Alon Cohen has said his ambition for pumpfun goes far beyond the memecoin casino into a gamified, communal experience. Pumpfun's team seeks to evolve it into a cross between a trading venue and a social media platform, where launching tokens is as much about identity and content as it is about price action. In this paradigm, pump competes more directly with TikTok and Meta than Binance or Robinhood.

At the ICO price, pump has a fully diluted valuation of $4 billion, and started trading at a $5.6 billion FDV. TikTok is valued at $300 billion as of late 2024, and Meta's market cap is in the trillions, so if pump achieves its huge ambition, the token is poised for upside of many multiples.

But, it was mostly whales who were able to get PUMP tokens at the ICO price.

The ICO was not only fast, it was exclusive. The process was gated behind KYC, relied on centralized exchange listings (Gate, KuCoin, Kraken, and several other CEXs), and offered no immediate utility or governance functionality for the token.

A Dune Analytics dashboard created by @adam_tehc shows:

And X account @SpotonChain says:

The fact that such a huge sale was over in minutes suggests that bots and sophisticated buyers were ready to execute, pushing out smaller buyers.

Another wrinkle to the same is that there appear to be 25 billion tokens missing.

According to pumpfun's initial announcement about the token and ICO, 15% of total supply was meant to be sold in the public token sale. Yet blockchain records show only 12.5% (125 billion tokens) were distributed. That leaves a gap of 2.5% (25 billion tokens), or over $100 million worth, unaccounted for — not a small amount, especially considering so many KYC-ed wallets didn't manage to get in on the sale. So far, no explanation has been issued by pumpfun explaining the discrepancy.

Even so, if pumpfun's ambitions come to life, this may be one of the rare moments in tech history when public buyers, not just VCs, had early access to the upside of a hyper-growth platform. Unlike most private companies that scale behind closed doors and list only after valuations hit the stratosphere, pumpfun opened its token sale to tens of thousands of participants.

What also sets pumpfun apart from most mega-ICOs of the past is that it didn't raise money on the promise of future potential. The platform has already facilitated the creation of millions of tokens, generated over $240 million in fees in the first half of 2025, and is the undisputed leader of Solana's memecoin meta. It's one of the only corners of crypto right now with clear product market fit and viral user demand. The ICO wasn't just speculative, it was the monetization of a proven, fast-scaling phenomenon.

In the meantime, competitors like letsBONK are rising fast, and Ethereum-based memecoin platforms may try to follow suit.

Pump has proven it can raise money. But the harder challenge lies ahead: executing on the expectations that drove this record-breaking ICO.

House Republicans today blocked a procedural motion that would have allowed formal consideration of several key crypto regulations, including the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC bills, a defense spending bill, and an amendment to release the Epstein files.

The motion failed by a vote of 196 to 223, with a majority of Republicans voting against it. As a result, the crypto legislation and related measures could not advance to floor debate or final passage.

Despite clearing the Rules Committee yesterday, the bills remained stalled without the rule's approval. Majority Leader Steve Scalise had scheduled the vote to set the terms of debate, with final passage expected later this week.

Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to internal disagreements within the Republican caucus. “We have some members who really, really want to emphasize the House's product,” Johnson said, referring to calls to merge the crypto bills into a single legislative package.

Majority Leader Steve Scalise echoed the internal divide, saying, “I was one of those who would like to see the whole package as one. But the president and the Senate really want us to move GENIUS first. The question is, do we play games with the Senate bill when the president has made it clear he wants GENIUS on his desk as it's written?”

The procedural failure also blocked consideration of a separate amendment that would have compelled the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's files.

Johnson said the House will vote again on the rule later this afternoon. For now, key crypto legislation and unrelated controversial amendments remain in limbo.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) railed against House leadership Tuesday for allegedly blocking efforts to amend the GENIUS Act, a crypto-friendly bill that would establish a regulatory framework for digital currencies.

Taken up for a procedural vote in the House on Tuesday, the GENIUS Act failed to advance in a vote of 196-222, with critics like Greene accosting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for apparently not accepting amendments to the bill. Her largest grievance, Greene said, was the omission of a ban on the federal government developing a Central Bank Digital Currency, something President Donald Trump banned in January via executive order.

“The Senate left that out, and they sent this over to the House and Speaker Johnson didn't allow us to do amendments, to amend the bill to ban CBDC,” Greene told members of the press Tuesday. 

“That's a House issue. I fully support the president, I will vote for the GENIUS Act when they ban the Central Bank Digital Currency. We need to get it right, it shouldn't be run through.”

Greene and other Trump allies have long opposed the establishment of a central bank digital currency out of fear of government overreach, with opposition to the federal government dipping its toes in cryptocurrency becoming a rallying cry for the MAGA faithful.

While she went on to pledge support for the bill when it eventually returns for a vote, Greene urged House leadership to allow a ban on establishing such a currency to move forward, and warned of the potential repercussions should her and her allies' efforts be stonewalled.

“Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency,” Greene wrote Tuesday in a social media post on X.

“Republicans have a duty to ban CBDC. President Trump included a ban on CBDC in his January 23rd executive order and Congress must also include the ban on CBDC in the GENIUS Act.”

House Republicans today blocked a procedural motion that would have allowed formal consideration of several key crypto regulations, including the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC bills. The failed motion prevented all the measures from advancing through the chamber. Despite clearing the Rules Committee on Tuesday, the crypto bills could not reach the floor without the rule's approval. Majority Leader Steve Scalise had scheduled a vote to set the terms of debate, with final passage expected later this week.

Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to internal disagreements within the Republican caucus as the reason for the block. “We have some members who really, really want to emphasize the House's product,” Johnson said, referring to calls to merge the crypto bills into a single legislative package. This internal disagreement highlights the challenges faced by the Republican Party in reaching a consensus on crypto regulations.

The procedural failure also blocked consideration of a separate amendment that would have compelled the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's files, further inflaming tensions around the motion. This development underscores the broader political dynamics at play, where multiple issues are intertwined and influencing the legislative process.

The delay in the vote for the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC acts is significant as these bills aim to provide clarity and regulation for the crypto industry. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, while the CLARITY Act aims to provide regulatory certainty for stablecoins. The Anti-CBDC Act, on the other hand, is designed to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The blocking of these bills by House Republicans indicates a lack of consensus within the party on how to approach crypto regulation. This delay could have implications for the crypto industry, as it leaves uncertainty about the regulatory environment. The industry has been calling for clear guidelines to operate within, and the delay in these bills could hinder innovation and investment in the sector.

The failure to advance these bills also highlights the broader challenges faced by the legislative process in the United States. With internal disagreements and competing priorities, it can be difficult to pass legislation, even on issues with broad support. This delay in crypto regulation is just one example of the challenges faced by lawmakers in navigating complex political dynamics.

As it sped into Crypto Week on Tuesday, the U.S. House's process toward passing digital assets bills ground to a sudden halt over a procedural vote as members of the House Freedom Caucus objected to the way some of the legislation has developed under Senate dominance.



The misfire on the procedural vote quickly slammed the crypto markets over uncertainty about the good news expected this week as the House has moved toward passage of two of the industry's top priorities. The legislation still has strong, bipartisan support, suggesting the procedural mishap may be overcome as a further vote was scheduled for later Tuesday afternoon. More than a dozen Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the motion.



Two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk another vote has been aimed for 5:00 p.m. ET, meaning this disruption could be resolved without delaying the more important votes currently expected on Wednesday and Thursday.



U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republicans to vote in favor of the rule earlier Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, saying passing GENIUS would help keep the U.S. ahead of other countries in crypto development.



Bitcoin BTC$116,422.26 and ether (ETH) each knee-jerked lower by about 0.5% on the news, but both have recovered most of those declines. High-flying stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) has moved to its session low, down 5.3% on the day. The stock remains higher by roughly six-fold since its IPO last month.



Procedural disruptions can be the norm in the legislative process. As the GENIUS Act headed toward passage in the Senate, a group of Democrats slammed the breaks to object to certain provisions and force more discussion. It's uncertain whether a similar delay could be forced by unhappy Republicans on this week's bills.

Two new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) targeting Solana SOL$160.69 and XRP XRP$2.8729 are launching in the U.S. on Tuesday, marking another step in the expanding intersection of traditional finance and digital assets.



ProShares, a major player in leveraged ETFs, rolled out the ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON) and the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP). Both products aim to deliver twice the daily performance of their respective underlying cryptocurrencies, but do so using regulated futures contracts — not by holding the tokens themselves, ProShares said in a press release.



The launches follow confirmation from NYSE Arca, which certified the “approval for listing” of both funds in coordination with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to two letters filed Monday.



While these ETFs won't offer investors direct exposure to the price movements of SOL or XRP, their arrival on U.S. exchanges reflects growing institutional comfort with crypto-backed products — particularly when tied to regulated derivatives markets.



Futures-based ETFs have historically played a role in paving the way for spot-based versions. The presence of a regulated futures market can help regulators gauge liquidity, pricing mechanisms and investor protection, all key factors in evaluating applications for spot ETFs.



Several asset managers, including VanEck and Bitwise, currently have active proposals with the SEC for spot Solana and spot XRP ETFs. The SEC has not yet approved any spot ETFs tied to either asset, but futures-based products like SLON and UXRP could influence that path.



The new funds also speak to increasing demand from traders and institutions looking for leveraged exposure to major altcoins, even as the regulatory picture for spot crypto products continues to evolve.

Crypto infrastructure firm Function has closed a $10 million seed round led by Galaxy Digital (GLXY), with participation from Antalpha (ANTA) and Mantle, the company said in a press release on Tuesday.

The round positions Function, formerly known as Ignition, at the forefront of a growing effort to unlock institutional yield opportunities from bitcoin BTC$116,474.84, which remains the largest yet least-utilized digital asset in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Function's flagship product, FBTC, a fully reserved and composable bitcoin representation, has already amassed $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), the company said.

Function is positioning FBTC as the gateway for institutions and corporate treasuries to productively deploy bitcoin while maintaining full custodial control and 1:1 asset backing.

The firm is entering the market as momentum builds around the institutional adoption of bitcoin, not just as a store of value, but as a yield-generating instrument. 

With Mike Novogratz's Galaxy joining as both an investor and core contributor, Function gains a heavyweight partner in scaling FBTC's institutional reach. Galaxy's involvement includes liquidity provisioning, governance and risk framework design, and strategic oversight.

“By 2026, treating bitcoin as a passive treasury asset may no longer be enough. The new standard will be actively earning yield” said Thomas Chen, CEO of Function, in emailed comments.

“We're evolving from wrapped assets to functional infrastructure that's programmable and institutional-grade to transform bitcoin into a productive asset class. Sophisticated allocators will demand their bitcoin work as hard as their cash. Those slow to adapt will underperform; forward-looking firms will win the next era of bitcoin yield.” Chen added.

 The California Breakthrough Project held its first meeting at Ripple's San Francisco headquarters, according to journalist Eleanor Terrett. 

California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a new government efficiency task force that includes representatives from various crypto firms, potentially signaling the state's recognition that blockchain technology could enhance public services.

The task force, dubbed California Breakthrough Project, has tapped executives from Ripple, Coinbase, MoonPay and others to “advise and advance government efficiency and collaboration,” journalist Eleanor Terrett reported Tuesday. 

According to Terrett, the task force held its inaugural meeting at Ripple's San Francisco headquarters on June 6. It aims to foster collaboration between California regulators and industry leaders across the technology and business sectors, address government inefficiencies and boost transparency around public services.

The project was confirmed by Governor Newsom, who issued the following statement:

Although Newsom's announcement did not clarify whether, or how, blockchain technology would support the project's mission, California is home to hundreds of blockchain companies that could offer insights into fostering innovation and transparency in government services.

According to the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency's Interagency Web3 Report, nearly one-quarter of the approximately 800 blockchain companies in North America are headquartered in the state.

The report suggests that California's thriving blockchain sector presents “an opportunity for leveraging new types of blockchain entrepreneurship and consumer interest.”

California's move to engage crypto firms comes amid growing regulatory momentum for digital assets in the United States, with stablecoin and market structure legislation currently in development.

Newsom's announcement also coincided with US Crypto Week, during which the House of Representatives is set to debate and vote on several crypto-related bills.

The week started with the House Committee on Rules reviewing the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act and the GENIUS Act, a comprehensive framework for US dollar stablecoins.

Monster Black Hole Merger Is Most Massive Ever Seen

A U.S. gravitational wave detector spotted a collision between fast-spinning “forbidden” black holes that challenge physics models

Physicists have detected the biggest ever merger of colliding black holes. The discovery has major implications for researchers' understanding of how such bodies grow in the Universe.

“It's super exciting,” says Priyamvada Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved in the research. The merger was between black holes with masses too big for physicists to easily explain. “We're seeing these forbidden high-mass black holes,” she says.

The discovery was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a facility involving two detectors in the United States. It comes at a time when US funding for gravitational-wave detection faces devastating cuts. The results, released as a preprint on the arXiv server1, were presented at the GR-Amaldi gravitational-waves meeting in Glasgow, UK, on 14 July.

LIGO detects gravitational waves by firing lasers down long, L-shaped arms. Minuscule changes in arm length reveal the passage of gravitational waves through the planet. The waves are ripples in space-time, caused by massive bodies accelerating, such as when two inspiralling black holes or neutron stars merge.

Hundreds of these mergers have been observed using gravitational waves since LIGO's first detection in 2015. But this latest detection, made in November 2023, is the biggest yet. By modelling the signal detected by LIGO, scientists have calculated that the event, dubbed GW231123, was caused by two black holes with masses of about 100 and 140 times that of the Sun merging to form a final black hole weighing in at some 225 solar masses.

“It's the most massive [merger] so far,” says Mark Hannam, a physicist at Cardiff University, UK, and part of the LVK Collaboration, a wider network of gravitational-wave detectors that encompasses LIGO, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. It's “about 50% more than the previous record holder”, he says.

Most of the events captured by LIGO involve stellar mass black holes — those ranging from a few to 100 times the mass of the Sun — which are thought to form when massive stars end their lives as supernovae. However, the two black holes involved in GW231123 fall in or near a predicted range, of 60–130 solar masses, at which this process isn't expected to work, with theories instead predicting that the stars should be blown apart. “So they probably didn't form by this normal mechanism,” says Hannam.

Instead, the two black holes probably formed from earlier merger events — hierarchical mergers of massive bodies that led to the event detected by LIGO, which is estimated to have happened 0.7 to 4.1 billion parsecs away (2.3—13.4 billion light years).

It's like “four grandparents merging into two parents merging into one baby black hole”, says Alan Weinstein, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and also part of the LVK Collaboration.

Models of the black holes also suggest that they were spinning exceedingly fast — about 40 times per second, which is near the limit of what Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts black holes can reach while remaining stable. “They're spinning very close to the maximal spin allowable,” says Weinstein.

Both the spin and the mass could provide clues to how black holes grow in the Universe. One of the biggest questions in astronomy is how the largest black holes, the supermassive black holes found at the centres of galaxies such as the Milky Way, grew in the early cosmos.

Although there is plenty of evidence for the existence of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes — those of more than a million solar masses — intermediate mass black holes in the range of 100 to 100,000 solar masses have been harder to find. “We don't see them,” says Natarajan.

The latest detection might tell us that “these intermediate-mass black holes of several hundred solar masses play a role in the evolution of galaxies”, says Hannam, perhaps through hierarchical mergers, which could increase the spin speed, as well as the mass, of the resulting black holes. “Little by little, we're building up a list of the kind of black holes that are out there,” he says.

That growth in knowledge could be hampered by the administration of US President Donald Trump and its proposed cuts to the US National Science Foundation, which runs LIGO. Under the proposal, one of LIGO's two gravitational-wave observatories would be shut down.

At the time of this detection in November 2023, Virgo and KAGRA were not operational. Without two detectors, scientists would not have been sure that they had made a real detection of two merging black holes, says Hannam. “Because we had two detectors, we saw the same blip at the same time,” he says.

The closure of one of the observatories would be “catastrophic”, says Natarajan. “This discovery would not be possible if one arm was turned off.”

Planned upgrades to LIGO in the coming years, and the addition of new detectors around the world, including one in India, could greatly increase physicists' capabilities in gravitational-wave research, an area of astronomy that is still in its infancy.

“We're going to be seeing thousands of black holes in the next few years,” says Hannam. “There's this huge investment that's been done, and it's only just beginning to pay off.”

Pneumonic Plague Infections in Modern Times Show the Black Death Isn't Dead

A person in Arizona recently died of pneumonic plague—a rare and severe form of the disease. An expert explains how the bacteria that spurred the Black Death centuries ago continues to claim lives

By Lauren J. Young edited by Dean Visser

Yersinia pestis.

Plague is often associated with Medieval history and the centuries-old Black Death epidemic, but a recent death in northern Arizona is a troublesome reminder of the flea-borne disease's lingering hold in parts of the world, including the U.S. Local health officials in Arizona's Coconino County, which includes the city of Flagstaff, confirmed late last week that a person there had died of pneumonic plague—a severe lung infection caused by Yersinia pestis, the bacterium behind the illness.

Human infections and fatalities from plague are relatively rare in the U.S.; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seven human cases are reported annually on average. Prior to the Arizona case, the most recent death was reported in 2021. Y. pestis arrived in port cities in the U.S. around 1900 and has since become endemic to rats and other rodents in western U.S. states including New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon and Nevada.

“From a public health standpoint in the U.S., it's a scary thing that it's plague, and it's tragic that that this was a fatal case, but people need to remember that it's extremely rare,” says David Wagner, executive director of the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University, who has studied plague for more than 25 years. “Not to be flippant, but it's more important that you put your seat belt on going to the grocery store than it is to worry about plague in the western U.S.”

Scientific American spoke with Wagner about plague's signs and symptoms, and its persistence across time.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

How do people get sick with plague?

Plague is caused by the bacterium Y. pestis and is really a disease of rodents and their fleas. You have an infected rodent; a flea feeds on the blood of that rodent, and it picks up some Y. pestis. Then when the flea feeds on another rodent, it can pass along the Y. pestis. It's constantly cycling back and forth between rodents and fleas in nature; that's how it's been maintained for thousands of years in the environment around the world.

Shuyao Xiao; Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (data)

What's the difference between bubonic and pneumonic plague?

People call it the Black Death; they call it bubonic plague; they call it pneumonic plague—it's all the same disease, just different clinical manifestations. What stands apart [with the recent case is] that it's pneumonic plague. That's kind of rare, especially in the U.S.

Pretty much all human cases, with a few exceptions, are acquired from the environment—from the bite of an infected flea. If there isn't a rodent host for that flea to feed on, it will look for other mammals to feed on. And if humans happen to be in proximity, it will feed on humans and can transmit Y. pestis.

If the immune system doesn't stop Y. pestis at the source of the flea bite, it will migrate through your lymphatic system to your closest major lymph node. So let's say I was bit on my wrist; then the bacteria would go to that lymph node in my underarm and start to reproduce there. And that mass swelling, that swollen lymph node, is called a bubo—that's why it's called bubonic plague. These days, it's a dead end because there's not flea-borne transmission from one human to another. It just stops there with the treatment or death of that individual.

Left untreated, though, bubonic plague can get down into your lungs via the bloodstream. That's called secondary pneumonic plague. Those individuals, then, via cough or direct contact, can spread plague person-to-person, and that's called primary pneumonic plague.

What people might not know is that plague has been endemic throughout the western U.S. in rodent populations for more than 100 years.

Someone could also get pneumonic plague from an animal—for example, if they were handling an infected animal and that animal coughed. Sometimes hunters in Central Asia will kill [infected] ground squirrels, and when they're skinning them can inhale particles. People also talk about septicemic plague, and that means it's gotten into your bloodstream, and that typically also arises from bubonic plague. You could also get [septicemic plague] directly if you had cuts on your hands and were handling rodents without gloves.

Can pets get infected or transmit plague to humans?

Pets, especially free-roaming ones, may come into contact with dead rodents that have died of plague. Fleas can hop onto pets, which then bring them into the home. This is pretty rare because there are so few [human] cases in the U.S., but that is something we think about.

Flea and tick collars are a good idea. If animals do get sick, most of the evidence shows that dogs fight off the infection and can create antibodies against Y. pestis. Cats are more susceptible and can quickly become sick and actually can progress to pneumonic plague. It's super, super rare, but that's a possible way for humans to be exposed to pneumonic plague.

What are the symptoms and treatment?

With bubonic plague, typically people develop a fever, headache, chills and fatigue, and then they'll get those swollen lymph nodes called buboes. It typically takes a few days to manifest because it sort of starts off in stealthy mode inside the body to try and avoid the immune system.

Plague is easily treated with many different types of antibiotics, as long as it's caught in time. If untreated, bubonic plague mortality rates may be somewhere between 30 to 60 percent, depending on the situation. Pneumonic plague, left untreated, is almost always fatal. So diagnostics become really important. The challenge is that many physicians in the U.S. have never seen plague. The symptoms are a bit common to other things, so rapid testing in the lab can help.

Where is plague typically found in the U.S. and around the world?

What people might not know is that plague has been endemic throughout the western U.S. in rodent populations for more than 100 years. It just so happened that a lot of the rodent host species in Central Asia, where it evolved, were quite similar to some of the ground squirrels that we have here in the U.S. It was first reported in native ground squirrels in California in 1908 and was in human populations before then. And then it spread really rapidly to the east and just sort of stopped at the western edge of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. It's a bit of a mystery why; the rodent diversity and climate changes quite a bit in [that region].

I'm also currently working on plague with colleagues in Madagascar, which has more human plague cases than any other country—around 75 percent of the global [case] total. It has hundreds to thousands of cases every year, with quite a few deaths.

How has it persisted over the years?

We don't have a good handle on which rodents are actually maintaining it in the U.S. So we've been going out and collecting plague-infected fleas from prairie dogs for more than 25 years because it's our window into plague activity. Prairie dogs are ground squirrels that live in dense colonies, so they're very conspicuous. If the prairie dogs die off, we go out and collect fleas from their burrows. We take a piece of white flannel, breathe on it to bait it with carbon dioxide, and then put it down the burrows. The fleas will hop on, and then we take them back to our laboratory and freeze them to kill them. Then we can study the Y. pestis DNA directly from those fleas. We're very careful when we do this, and we talk with our physicians here at Northern Arizona University. Every year we review the symptoms and they give us a prescription for antibiotics. Then we do what we call fever watch, where we take our temperature before we go out.

The prairie dogs can't be maintaining it because they're just so susceptible—it'll just wipe out a whole colony when it gets in. And so there's other rodents out there maintaining plague, but it's still a bit of a mystery in the western U.S.

How has it become less dangerous?

There were three great historical plague pandemics, and it's estimated that maybe 250 million people died [total]. But we don't have those large pandemics anymore because we have hygiene, which controls rat populations in cities—and then, most importantly, we have antibiotics.

What Would It Take for Bird Flu to Spread among Humans?

The H5N1 avian flu is circulating in cows and other mammals. Whether it will make a permanent leap to humans is another question

By Stephanie Pappas edited by Jeanna Bryner

H5N1 avian influenza has long been a concerning virus. Since its discovery in 1996 in waterfowl, bird flu has occasionally caused isolated human cases that have quite often been fatal. But last year H5N1 did something strange: it started infecting cattle.

The absolute oddity of this leap may have been somewhat lost in the flood of bad news about H5N1, which by 2024 had already caused mass die-offs of seals and other marine mammals and which was simultaneously devastating chicken farms and causing periodic shortages of eggs. But infectious disease specialists were shocked. “Flu in cows is not really a thing,” says Jenna Guthmiller, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. “If you would ask anybody that studies flu on their 2024 bingo card if they had, you know, mammary infection of dairy cows on there, no one would have.”

Influenza hadn't previously been known to infect cattle, much less cause the kind of infections in their udders that have now begun circulating in milking parlors across the country. The continued circulation of H5N1 in cows is one of the biggest concerns experts have about this flu subtype. Though H5N1 hasn't yet spread human-to-human, people can catch the disease from cattle, mostly through close contact with infected milk. And the more it circulates in an animal that humans regularly interact with, the more chances the flu has to stumble on just the right mutation to leap to people and start adapting into something with pandemic potential.

“That's the main thing I worry about in terms of potential human disease,” says Jonathan Runstadler, a professor of infectious disease and global health at the Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. “[It's] increasing that interface and giving the virus the opportunity to establish infection in humans.”

Researchers are still trying to catalogue the ways the virus has adapted to spread within cows, seals, cats and hundreds of other mammal species. They're watching for particular mutations and adaptations that might hint that a certain strain of H5N1 could start spreading from person to person. But as the surprise leap into cows shows, flu viruses sometimes do something unexpected and unpredictable. There may be unknown genetic mutations not yet on scientists' watchlists that could change H5N1's behavior overnight.

The early spring day that H5N1 was first reported to be circulating in dairy cattle was a memorable one for Guthmiller and her colleagues. Guthmiller grew up on a 70-head dairy cattle farm in South Dakota, a biographical tidbit she never expected to overlap with her work as a flu researcher. Flu infecting the udders of cows was such an out-of-left-field idea that when cows started to show signs of sickness (such as poor appetite and discolored milk) in early 2024, veterinarians didn't think to test for influenza at first. It was actually the simultaneous sickening of barn cats, which then tested positive for flu, that led researchers to look for the virus in the cows.

Guthmiller and her lab members were already trying to figure out the genetic sequences of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the H1N1 seasonal flu that regularly infects humans. The receptor-binding domain is a crucial but delicate fragment of the flu virus that allows it to dock onto and enter specific cells in the body. Mutations within the RBD can enable a virus to lock on to new receptors on new host cell surface. Different species have different types of these receptors, so a genetic switch by the virus can open up new host species for infection. Sometimes, however, a mutation can turn a functional virus into a functionally dead one that's unable to invade any host at all. Guthmiller asked her graduate student Marina Good to pull the genetic sequences for the receptor-binding domain of this bizarre cow strain of H5N1. She feared that the mutated form of RBD in this strain could unlock a cell receptor that predominates in the human respiratory tract.

In general, flu viruses like to bind to tiny strings of sugars on cell surfaces called sialic acids. These sialic acids are linked together by different kinds of bonds. Avian flu tends to attach to an alpha-2,3 bond. Alpha-2,3 receptors are bountiful in the gastrointestinal tracts of waterfowl and the upper respiratory tracts of chickens.

Humans have alpha-2,3 receptors, too, but mostly in the conjunctiva, or lining of the eye, and deep in our lungs. Our upper respiratory tract is largely filled with alpha-2,6, which is the preferred target of the seasonal influenzas that typically circulate in humans. The fact that humans carry alpha-2,3 receptors in the eyes and lower respiratory tract means that we can catch H5N1; currently this appears as mild pink eye or occasionally as a profoundly serious viral pneumonia. Even so, the virus doesn't easily infect the lining of our nose and throat. If it did, humans likely would have spread the disease to one another rapidly via coughing, sneezing and simply breathing.

Less than a month after the first public report of H5N1 in a dairy cow in March 2024, Good, Guthmiller and their colleagues discovered a bit of good news that they posted on the preprint site bioRxiv: The flu hadn't made this crucial shift, meaning the circulating strain still preferred alpha-2,3 receptors. (These findings have been replicated multiple times since then, suggesting this is still the case.) What the virus had done, however, was become less choosy about the alpha-2,3-containing sugars it could bind with, Guthmiller says, likely helping enable the sudden spread within cows and other mammals.

Amanda Montañez

In some ways, labeling influenza types “avian” or “mammalian” can be a little misleading, says Daniel Perez, a professor of poultry medicine at the University of Georgia who studies how viruses leap from animals to humans. Perez and his team have been studying a modified form of H5N1 that is less deadly to animals, and they're finding that the virus's big evolutionary shift has been to replicate more easily in wild bird airways, not just in their gastrointestinal tracts.

“The changes that we're actually seeing in the virus are not necessarily mammalian-adapted mutations,” Perez says. “What we are seeing is more of these respiratory-adapted mutations that occasionally do help it to replicate better in mammals.”

The shift to mammals might have been incidental at first. But now mutations are accumulating in the cattle version of the virus. For instance, they found a mutation in the amino acids at a position in the virus strain's genome called 631, a spot where changes are known to help a virus better interact with mammalian proteins inside the cell. These proteins are involved in the translation of genetic instructions to cellular activity, including the replication of genes that the virus needs to reproduce. “What we're starting to see are sprinklings of more of these mammalian adaptions happening in the background of this cattle strain,” says Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Emory University.

As this mammalian spread continues, Lakdawala and other infectious disease researchers worry about further mutations that would help this flu spread even more easily between mammals. This might happen in a slow and stepwise fashion, leading to more animal-human spillovers, followed by household transmission between close contacts and finally to community spread, Lakdawala says. Or it might be quick: another worry is reassortment, the ability of a flu virus to snag genetic material from another flu virus more adept at infecting people. A person who happened to be infected with both avian flu and seasonal flu could be ground zero for this kind of change. “If this virus continues to circulate in cows and continues to have these sporadic spillover events, eventually it's going to gain segments through reassortment with either a human seasonal strain or a pig strain or another bird strain,” Lakdawala says. If that happens, a pandemic could take off overnight.

When people are exposed to a high enough viral load of H5N1, they can become infected. There have been 70 known human cases in the U.S., including one death. But to establish itself in a human host, H5N1 would need to do three things, says Richard Webby, the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds who studies host-microbe interactions at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

One is to better attach to the receptors found in the human upper respiratory tract, those alpha-2,6 receptors that the virus has not yet unlocked. Fortunately, that seems to be a difficult evolutionary trick for the virus to pull off, Webby says. Perhaps multiple simultaneous evolutionary changes would be needed to make the switch successfully, or maybe receptor binding is so important to a virus's survival, that this part of its genome doesn't mutate so quickly. Whatever the reason, Webby says, “we haven't really seen any movement there” since H5N1 was discovered.

The second change the virus must make is to adapt itself to better interact with the proteins inside human cells. The virus needs these proteins to hijack host cells and replicate, and these proteins in birds and mammals are quite different from each other. There are some changes that researchers suspect would create a strain of H5N1 that is more suited to infecting humans, Webby says. A variant gene sequence in a part of the virus called the PB2-627 domain is known to enable H5N1 to better interact with the human protein ANP32A and more effectively replicate itself. “It's a change the virus can make pretty easily when it does start to replicate in a mammal system, unlike the receptor change,” Webby says.

Finally, an adapted avian flu would need to evade our innate immune system, the body's nonspecific defenses against new invaders. Human influenzas, for example, are adept at evading human antiviral proteins called Mx GTPases, while H5N1 is not.

There are other considerations as well, including how long the virus can survive outside the body, which determines how easily it can transmit. The cattle strain of H5N1 is very stable in milk, Lakdawala and her team have found. For a virus to transmit between people, though, it needs to be stable in human mucus or saliva. Seasonal influenzas that infect humans are expelled into the world in tiny globules of spit or snot, and those secretions protect the virus as it travels between hosts, Lakdawala says. “Novel viruses that come in may not have that same kind of protection,” she says.

On the other hand, if dairy workers continue to catch H5N1 pink eye from milking cows, there is a risk of further adaptation—in all of these ways. Being able to recognize alpha-2,3 alone seems sufficient for the virus to keep spreading in cows, Guthmiller says, so there doesn't seem to be much evolutionary pressure for the virus to recognize alpha-2,6 receptors in the cow mammary glands, Guthmiller says. But the human nose, connected to the eye lining by the tear ducts, could be fertile ground for H5N1 if it could unlock those ample receptors. Each time the virus spreads from a cow to a person, it gets another shot at this evolutionary opportunity.

The virus may or may not take it. It may or may not be able to. One complication to this story, Guthmiller says, is that though the nose is probably the first place in the body that the immune system encounters most viruses, researchers know little about the immune response in the nasal tissue. It's a labyrinth of folded mucosa, and unlike blood, it's not easy to get samples of the actual tissue from a person who is sick or recovered. Guthmiller's lab is now studying internal nose samples from people who have had this tissue surgically removed for unrelated medical reasons. They're mapping the cell types found in the layers of tissue, trying to understand how the nose responds to new incursions by unfamiliar viral visitors.

The CDC ended its emergency response to avian flu in early July, citing a decline in animal cases and the absence of human cases since February 2025. Avian flu is somewhat seasonal, with peaks in fall and spring as wild birds migrate.

But evolution happens over longer time scales. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic, known as the “swine flu” pandemic, was caused by a new H1N1 flu strain that had emerged from a mix of several pig flus, a human flu and an avian flu. Oddly, people older than age 60 had some preexisting immunity to this new Frankenstein's monster of a virus, which turned out to be because it shared similarity with the descendants of the devastating 1918 pandemic flu. These long-ago flu lineages had been in circulation when people aged 60-plus in 2009 were kids but had been replaced by H2N2 viruses in 1957. Pig versions had persisted, however, gradually evolving and swapping bits of genes with avian and human flus. Before the 2009 virus had emerged, a handful of farm workers had been infected with these “triple-reassorted” viruses, but these infections didn't go on to infect others. Then, “all of a sudden, the North American pig lineage grabbed two segments from the Eurasian pig lineages, probably somewhere in [Mexico], and that virus started to spill over,” Lakdawala says. A new human pandemic, which may have killed around half a million people worldwide, was born.

Fortunately, there are already approved human vaccines for H5N1, Perez says. These are based on older strains, but the vaccines would probably still protect against severe disease should the virus start spreading human-to-human. Preexisting vaccine know-how and newer technologies such as those used to create mRNA vaccines would also allow for the quick development of updated vaccines, he says.

Whether H5N1 causes the next flu pandemic, it's safe to say one will come. There have been four flu pandemics since 1918, and today's high-density agricultural practices provide prime hunting ground for viruses. On poultry farms, nearly 175 million birds have been affected since 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Egg-laying operations have been dense for decades, but similar practices are spreading to other types of animal husbandry. Small farms with a few dozen cows, like the one Guthmiller grew up on, were once common. Now farms with at least 1,000 cows comprise more than 55 percent of the dairy herds in the U.S., according to the USDA. This density, along with the practice of moving cows between herds, means that viral spillovers that might have once died out on a small farm in South Dakota can now spread far and wide.

In that sense, rather than a revolutionary understanding of influenza, Perez says, the best course of action might be a rethinking of agricultural practices. Humans are increasing the size of farms without increasing farm hygiene, which sets the stage for the emergence of new pathogens.

“Yes, we can keep making better vaccines faster,” he says. But an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. “It would be much easier if we created the conditions of raising animals in a way that actually prevents emergence of disease instead of promoting them,” Perez says. “The best vaccine is the one we don't have to use.”

Can you imagine a life-saving molecule whose ""twin"" is a deadly poison? As surprising as it may seem, this chemical reality is known as ""chirality."" Like a right hand and a left hand, two molecules can have the same composition, but a different shape and arrangement in space. And this difference can change everything. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon is crucial to drug design. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the University of Pisa, has developed a new family of remarkably stable chiral molecules. This work opens up new prospects for the design of geometry-controlled drugs. It is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

A molecule, or any object, is said to be chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any combination of rotations, translations and geometric changes. This is similar to our two hands, which appear identical but cannot be superimposed, whether viewed from the back or the palm. This universal molecular asymmetry requires chemists to design chiral molecules capable of interacting precisely with living systems.

Within a molecule, chirality often arises from the presence of one or more asymmetry centers, known as stereogenic centers. These are often made up of a central carbon atom, itself linked to four different groups or chains of atoms, usually carbon as well. The group led by Jérôme Lacour, Full Professor in the Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UNIGE Faculty of Science, has created a new type of stereogenic center. This time, the central carbon atom is not surrounded by carbon chains, but only by oxygen and nitrogen atoms. A first in the field of chemistry.

''Molecules with this new type of stereogenic center had never before been isolated in a stable form. Their synthesis and characterization mark a major conceptual and experimental breakthrough,'' explains Jérôme Lacour.

Outstanding stability

The stability of chiral molecules is a particularly important parameter. Mirror molecule pairs are structurally very close, and in many cases spontaneous switching from one to the other is possible, for example under the effect of temperature. As if a left hand were suddenly transformed into a right hand. In this way, we could switch from a drug to an inactive or even toxic molecule! The new molecular structures developed by the UNIGE team feature exceptional chiral stability, meaning that the switch from one molecule to its mirror sister is particularly unlikely.

Olivier Viudes, PhD student and first author of the study explains: ""Using dynamic chromatography techniques and quantum chemistry calculations, we have shown that, for the first molecule developed, it would take 84,000 years at room temperature for half a sample to transform into its mirror molecule."" For a drug, such stability guarantees safe storage, without the need for specific conditions. For the second molecule, this time has been estimated at 227 days at 25°C.

The new stereogenic centers developed by the Geneva team should enable the design of stable, controlled, three-dimensional chiral molecules. These structures open up new possibilities for drug design and the creation of new materials. ''These novel stereogenic centers offer a new way of organizing molecular space. They open up a whole new degree of freedom and imagination in chemical synthesis,'' concludes Gennaro Pescitelli, professor at the University of Pisa and co-principal investigator of the article.

Series 
15 July 2025


The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium is a multi-national database that aims to leverage proteomics and clinical data to understand and improve the lives of those with neurodegenerative diseases. In this series we present the initial findings of the consortium, including a description of the dataset and deep dives showing insights the dataset can provide on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, aging and APOE4.

Recent progress on Alzheimer's disease shows what we gain when scientists work together — and what the world loses when bad policies force them apart.

The largest harmonized proteomic dataset of plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples across major neurodegenerative diseases reveals both disease-specific and transdiagnostic proteomic signatures, including a robust plasma profile associated with the APOEε4 genotype.

Large-scale plasma proteomics of 10,527 samples from the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium identified shared and disease-specific pathways in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia.

Proteomic analysis of paired cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples from 2,171 individuals drawn from multiple cohorts, including the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium, reveals age-related changes in the ratios of proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma that are associated with cognitive function, enhancing understanding of blood–brain barrier dynamics in aging.

Over 11,000 plasma and cerebrospinal fluid proteomic samples reveal that the APOE ε4 genetic variant is associated with a systemic pro-inflammatory signature in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

A new Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium provides a wealth of data to boost mechanistic understanding, biomarker research and drug development during aging and in neurodegenerative diseases — and dementia in particular.

The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC) is a multifaceted open-data resource of about 250 million protein measurements for biomarker discovery and mechanistic research across several neurodegenerative diseases. By harmonizing large-scale proteomic datasets with clinical data across 23 studies, the GNPC offers an important resource for neurodegenerative disease research and a template for large-scale data sharing in other scientific endeavors.

Wearable ultrasound technology refers to ultrasound devices designed with compact form factors that do not restrict the mobility or routine functions of the wearer. These devices are intended to provide continuous monitoring of internal tissue structures and offer therapeutic intervention without manual operation. Wearable ultrasound technology has potential applications in the management of chronic diseases, acute conditions during surgeries and emergencies, and post-operative care. This technology can provide clinicians and patients with data and insights, such as patterns of physiological variations over time and critical periods of disease progression, that are hardly attainable using conventional handheld ultrasound devices. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in wearable ultrasound technology, focusing on material selection, mechanical design, the integration of wearable systems, and exemplary medical applications. Additionally, we provide a framework for expanding the adoption of wearable ultrasound technology, particularly in low-resource settings, by exploring barriers in technology transfer. Finally, we identify critical challenges from scientific, engineering and clinical perspectives to advance wearable ultrasound technology to the next stages of development.

Wearable ultrasound technology enables hands-free, operator-independent and continuous operation.

The integration of miniaturized back-end circuits, autonomous signal processing algorithms and multimodal sensing systems is intended to enhance diagnosis accuracy, user experience and patient outcomes.

Wearable ultrasound technology has shown potential in a wide range of use cases, although most of the results are yet to be validated against gold standards in well-controlled clinical studies.

To enable clinical translation, it is necessary to carry out controlled clinical studies, establish safety protocols for therapeutic intervention, and integrate wearable data with electronic health records.

Future advancements should focus on improving imaging resolution, realizing efficient 3D imaging, integrating control electronics with low size, weight and power consumption, creating breathable device packaging.

Carbon–sulfur bond-forming reactions in natural product biosynthesis largely involve Lewis acid/base chemistry with relatively few examples catalysed by radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzymes. The latter have been limited to radical-mediated sulfur insertion into carbon–hydrogen bonds with the sulfur atom originating from a sacrificial auxiliary iron–sulfur cluster. Here we show that the radical SAM enzyme AbmM encoded in the albomycin biosynthetic gene cluster catalyses a sulfur-for-oxygen swapping reaction, transforming the furanose ring of cytidine 5′-diphosphate to a thiofuranose moiety that is essential for the antibacterial activity of albomycin δ2. Thus, in addition to its canonical function of mediating the reductive cleavage of SAM, the radical SAM catalytic cluster of AbmM appears to play a role in providing the sulfur introduced during the AbmM-catalysed reaction. These discoveries not only establish the origin of the thiofuranose core in albomycin δ2 but, more importantly, also emphasize the functional diversity of radical SAM catalysis.

(a) Detection of l-methionine by LCMS. EIC traces corresponding to the [M + H]+ signal of l-methionine (m/z = 150.0583) are shown. A small amount of l-methionine was detected from the reaction mixture without AbmM or dithionite likely due to nonenzymatic degradation of SAM. (b) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction mixture. The [M – H]− signal at m/z 402.0130 arises from CDP (10, calc for C9H14N3O11P2−, 402.0109). The [M – H]− signal at m/z 433.9849 is consistent with the mass of 13 (calc. for C9H14N3O11P2S−, 433.9830). (c) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction carried out under different conditions. The analysis was conducted after the incubation mixture was treated with CIP. Three EIC traces (m/z = 276.06, 244.09, and 252.2, corresponding to the [M + H]+ signals from 14, 8, and 5′-deoxyadenosine, respectively) are overlaid. (d) LCMS analysis of the AbmM reaction with different substrates such as cytidine, CMP, CDP and CTP (8-11). Prior to the analysis, the incubation mixture was treated with CIP. Three EIC traces (m/z = 276.06, 244.09, and 252.2, corresponding to the [M + H]+ signals from 14, 8, and 5′-deoxyadenosine, respectively) are overlaid. Other tested compounds, cytidine 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate (2′:3′-cyclic CMP), cytidine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (3′:5′-cyclic CMP), 2′-deoxycytidine (2′-dC), 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-monophosphate (2′-dCMP), 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-diphosphate (2′-dCDP), deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (2′-dCTP), adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), guanosine 5′-diphosphate (GDP), guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP), thymidine 5′-diphosphate (TDP), thymidine 5′-triphosphate (TTP), uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP), and uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP), were not accepted by AbmM as judged by no formation of 5′-deoxyadenosine (data not shown). (e) HPLC analysis of purified 14.

The measurement conditions are indicated with external magnetic fields parallel to the γ-radiation. Bars show experimental data with statistical uncertainty of the data (the length of the vertical bars), red solid lines represent overall simulations. Simulation parameters are listed in Extended Data Table 2. The sample of 57Fe-PT-AbmM was prepared by overexpressing AbmM in media enriched with 57Fe and subsequently treated with PT before spectroscopic characterization. The sample of 56Fe-PT-57Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster was prepared by overexpressing AbmM ΔRS-cluster variant in media containing natural abundance Fe, followed by treatment of the isolated protein with PT and then reconstitution with 57FeCl3. The resulting sample was further treated with PT. Other combinations such as 56Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster were prepared in an analogous manner. The Fe content analysis yielded (Fe/protein monomer) 2.4 for as-isolated AbmM-ΔRS cluster, 2.4 for 56Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster, 6.0 for 56Fe-PT-57Fe-AbmM-ΔRS cluster, and 2.7 for 56Fe-PT-57Fe-PT-AbmM-ΔRS cluster.

Newly uncovered metadata reveals that nearly three minutes of footage were cut from what the US Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation described as “full raw” surveillance video from the only functioning camera near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead. The video was released last week as part of the Trump administration's commitment to fully investigate Epstein's 2019 death but instead has raised new questions about how the footage was edited and assembled.

WIRED previously reported that the video had been stitched together in Adobe Premiere Pro from two video files, contradicting the Justice Department's claim that it was “raw” footage. Now, further analysis shows that one of the source clips was approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds longer than the segment included in the final video, indicating that footage appears to have been trimmed before release. It's unclear what, if anything, the minutes cut from the first clip showed.

The nearly three-minute discrepancy may be related to the widely reported one-minute gap—between 11:58:58 pm and 12:00:00 am—that attorney general Pam Bondi has attributed to a nightly system reset. The metadata confirms that the first video file, which showed footage from August 9, 2019, continued for several minutes beyond what appears in the final version of the video and was trimmed to the 11:58:58 pm mark, right before the jump to midnight. The cut to the first clip doesn't necessarily mean that there is additional time unaccounted for—the second clip picks up at midnight, which suggests the two would overlap—nor does it prove that the missing minute was cut from the video.

The footage was released at a moment of political tension. Trump allies had spent months speculating about the disclosure of explosive new evidence about Epstein's death. But last week, the DOJ and FBI issued a memo stating that no “incriminating ‘client list'” exists and reaffirmed the government's long-standing conclusion that Epstein—whom the US government accused of committing conspiracy to sex traffic minors and sex trafficking minors—died by suicide. That announcement triggered immediate backlash from pro-Trump influencers and media figures, who essentially accused the administration of a cover-up.

In response to detailed questions about how the video was assembled, WIRED sent a request for comment to the Department of Justice at 7:40 am on Tuesday morning. Just two minutes later, Natalie Baldassarre, a public affairs officer for the DOJ, replied tersely: “Refer you to the FBI.” The FBI declined WIRED's request for comment.

On Friday, WIRED published an analysis of metadata embedded in the video, confirmed by independent video forensics experts, which indicates that the file was assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ's website, where it was presented as “raw” footage.

WIRED's initial analysis found that those saves took place over a 23-minute span; however, further analysis of additional metadata shows the file was actually edited and saved several times over a period of more than three and a half hours on May 23, 2025. Specifically, the file was created at 4:48 pm and last modified at 8:16 pm ET that day. The metadata also references “MJCOLE~1,” which is likely a shortened version of a longer username. While it likely begins with “MJCOLE,” the full name cannot be determined from the metadata alone.

Both analyses found that the two clips, labeled “2025-05-22 16-35-21.mp4” and “2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4,” were stitched together. The first clip is 4 hours, 19 minutes, and 16 seconds long, but only the first 4 hours, 16 minutes, and 23.368 seconds appears in the published version, meaning nearly 2 minutes and 53 seconds were cut from the end. According to the metadata, the cut occurs just at 11:58:58 pm. The cut is milliseconds before the one-minute recording gap that Bondi said was caused by a quirk of the surveillance system. The second clip, “2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4,” picks up immediately afterward, continuing the footage from 12:00:00 am until 6:40:00 am.

WIRED reviewed its findings with two independent video forensics experts, each with over 15 years of experience in Premiere and video production, who confirmed that the edit occurred just before the missing minute mark and that approximately three minutes of footage were cut from the original clip.

The FBI released both “raw” and enhanced versions of the video. Both versions include internal comment markers, annotations typically used in editing software to flag moments of interest. The enhanced version, which the FBI referred to as Video 2, contains 15 such markers that apparently correspond to visible movement near “46 door” at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). This door is near the cell block where Epstein was being held while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. These markers appear to have been left by analysts during their review, but they do not include the original comment text.

According to a 2023 report by the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General (OIG), only two cameras in the vicinity of the Special Housing Unit (SHU), the area of the MCC where Epstein was held, were filming and recording at the time of his death. According to the report, the camera that recorded the footage the DOJ released July 7 captured video of a large portion of the SHU common area and parts of the stairways leading to various “tiers,” one of which housed Epstein's cell.

The OIG report notes that the MCC's surveillance system was outdated at the time of Epstein's death, “had not been properly maintained,” and that the DVR hard drives that stored the video files “frequently malfunctioned and needed to be replaced.”

Both the 2023 OIG report and the DOJ-FBI memo published last week state that anyone entering or attempting to access the tier containing Epstein's cell from the SHU common area on August 9 or 10, 2019, would have been visible on that camera. However, Epstein's cell door itself was not within the camera's field of view. The stairway leading to the tier where he was held was also partially obstructed and difficult to see clearly on the video. (A second camera, which covered the “ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor's four elevators,” was also filming at the time, according to the OIG report.)

Amid backlash from supporters and critics alike, President Donald Trump defended Bondi on Saturday, saying she was doing a “fantastic job.”

“What's going on with my ‘boys' and, in some cases, ‘gals?' They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Tech Billionaires Back Erebor in the Wake of Silicon Valley Bank Collapse","https://www.wired.com/story/palmer-luckey-joe-lonsdale-bank-erebor/","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:29:20 GMT","

Palmer Luckey, cofounder of the weapons manufacturer Anduril, along with firms connected to Palantir cofounders Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, are investing in a new bank that is aiming to fill a gap left by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse two years ago. The venture is expected to be backed by upwards of $250 million in funding from Luckey, Lonsdale's venture firm 8VC, Thiel's Founders Fund, crypto-focused VC Haun Ventures, and several angel investors whose identities are not yet publicly known.

Like Anduril and Palantir, Erebor Bank is named after a term coined by J.R.R. Tolkien. (Introduced in The Hobbit, it's the name of a mountain where the murderous dragon Smaug hoards gold and jewels.) The bank's organizers and backers have remained tight-lipped about their vision. But their national bank charter application filed in June with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as well as interviews with more than a dozen industry sources, suggest the organizers are leveraging current regulatory openness in banking, as well as their political power, to build a crypto-focused Silicon Valley Bank successor made in their image.

The leadership team named in Erebor's application includes Michael Hagedorn, an experienced bank executive who will serve as Erebor's president; Trevor Capozza, head of operations at Palmer Luckey's family office; and co-CEOs Owen Rapaport, cofounder of crypto compliance platform Aer Compliance, and Jacob Hirshman, who has served in regulatory and advisory roles at the stablecoin provider Circle. Erin Gleason, chief communications officer of Founders Fund, told WIRED that Thiel was “not involved” in the deal and that Founders Fund invested $1 million into Erebor. Luckey and Lonsdale are not named in the nonconfidential sections of Erebor's filings; the application notes that major shareholders will not be involved in day-to-day operations.

Luckey, 8VC, Erebor's organizers, and their attorney, Adam Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment.

Erebor's intended client base is similar to that of Silicon Valley Bank, which served as the go-to business-banking partner for the San Francisco Bay Area tech industry and its affiliates. (SVB famously collapsed in March 2023 after economic volatility and risky liquidity practices led to a run on the bank. First Citizens Bank purchased SVB after the collapse; it now operates as a subsidiary.) The proposed bank states in its OCC filing that its customers would include startups in industries like crypto, AI, and defense, as well as wealthy and ultrawealthy consumers working in these fields. It also plans to assist foreign banks with some dollar-based activities. Erebor claims its target business clients are currently “not well served by either traditional or disruptive financial institutions, in particular with respect to insufficient access to credit” and says it will maintain a conservative balance sheet to account for the risks of “having a loan portfolio focused on frontier industries.”

Erebor also has crypto aspirations, including becoming “the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions” and facilitating “broader acceptance of stablecoins.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a currency or traditionally less-volatile commodity; they are often backed by cash or instruments like treasury bills with the aim of maintaining a consistent value. The bank additionally says it would accept cryptocurrencies as collateral for some loans.

Erebor is part of a growing wave of corporations applying for bank charters following Donald Trump's return to the White House. Regulators appointed by Trump have expressed an interest in reviewing new entrants with an “open mind.”

“The OCC is being very friendly to new applicants,” says Michele Alt, a regulatory consultant who previously worked in the OCC's Law Department. Alt says she believes that, under Trump, the OCC is trying to accelerate the review process for new banks, and applicants may see approvals within four to six months of filing, down from the current year-plus waiting period. (An OCC spokesperson said the agency ""does not comment on pending licensing applications or specific financial institutions"" in response to a request for comment by WIRED.)

The Trump administration has also reversed several Biden-era rules that limited banks from using stablecoins for payments and holding dollar reserves for stablecoin providers, opening the floodgates for financial institutions to launch stablecoin-based payment systems and serve stablecoin companies as clients. In March, for example, Rodney Hood, then-acting head of the OCC, overturned a Biden-era directive that had compelled banks to prove that they had “controls in place to conduct [stablecoin] activity in a safe and sound manner” before using stablecoin products and services. The Trump family, meanwhile, launched its own Trump-branded stablecoin earlier this year.

Stablecoin advocates say the technology can be used to make real-time, cross-border payments more affordable. Some point to their use for remittances, or they laud stablecoins' ability to expand the power of the US dollar. Detractors argue that stablecoins effectively remove US dollars from circulation, weakening the power of the Fed to set and control monetary policy. Migrating to a digital system that has experienced crashes and is weakly regulated also raises fears of contagion, which could elevate risk and erode trust in financial systems.

Crypto companies Circle, Ripple, BitGo, and a subsidiary of Protego are all applying for banking charters; Coinbase is “actively considering” a charter application; and payments firm Wise has also filed with the OCC.

If approved by the OCC and other regulators, Erebor can accept deposits, make loans, and be eligible for Federal Reserve payment systems as well as FDIC insurance. (Circle, Protego, and Wise are applying for charters primarily for facilitating payments through federal systems.)

Some new charter applications reflect “the adoption of ‘pay to play' in a whole lot of areas that traditionally did not work that way,” says Todd Baker, a financial services executive and senior fellow at Columbia Business School and Columbia Law School. Luckey and Lonsdale have been outspoken supporters and funders of Donald Trump as well as successful government contractors.

That the cofounders of a weapons manufacturer and surveillance behemoth have set their sights on banking may raise some eyebrows. There are some statutes, such as the Bank Holding Company Act and Change of Bank Control Act, that aim to prevent commercial ventures and their owners from engaging in banking activities or exerting control over banks (with a few exceptions). At the same time, as an early adopter of blockchain-based cross-border payments technologies for defense and law-enforcement purposes, such as for paying assets overseas, Erebor may be considered useful by the US government as a clearing house for blockchain-based government activities, according to Kevin Lehtiniitty, an executive in stablecoin-based payments infrastructure who has counted US government agencies as clients.

""What I imagine is going on here is that should this become a new chartered bank … the bank would be providing this ‘cash in, obfuscated crypto out' type of a product that would allow these agencies to be able to make payments,” he says.

Anduril also knows how to sell to the US government, and Erebor can use some parts of Anduril's growth strategy, says Rory McDonald, a business school professor at the University of Virginia who has studied Anduril. In Anduril's case, Palmer Luckey and his cofounders started by targeting the US government's border-security technologies, identifying them as a “fringe” part of the defense market. They offered an “imperfect but good enough technological solution and then [rode] the wave of improvement in that technology,” McDonald tells WIRED.

High-risk startups in crypto, AI, and defense may be that fringe market for Erebor—especially crypto companies. Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank—both of which failed around the same time as SVB—had also aimed to corner the crypto business-banking market by offering crypto-focused services.

Stephen Marcus, cofounder and general partner of Riot Ventures, which invests in some of the industries Erebor intends to serve, says Erebor will soon have to speak publicly about its products and determine how it will “communicate the stability” to potential business clients. “At the end of the day, these companies need access to liquidity, and they can't afford to have their cash not accessible,” he says, noting the “notoriety of the investors and those that are booting it up might be helpful,” though they'll have to “earn” companies' trust outside the portfolio companies whose banking decisions they can influence more easily.

Granted, that assumes Erebor gets that far; for all the deregulation making charter approvals speedier and more likely, regulators may see Erebor's application as too unprecedented or systemically risky. According to Evey Guo, principal at lobbying firm and consulting group FS Vector (founded by the former chief compliance officer and general counsel of Circle), Erebor's “novel elements” may elicit “additional regulatory scrutiny and require particularly robust controls.” Another banking industry specialist said Erebor's “monocrop” client profile could also cause concern, as a lack of client diversity partially contributed to the bank collapses of 2023. Additionally, Baker, the senior fellow at Columbia, contends Erebor's conservative approach to lending relative to its balance sheet may impose hurdles, as regulators have rejected previous banking proposals that shied away from lending.

Michele Alt, the regulatory consultant, sees a potential clash between the crypto industry and incumbent banks, which are “two very powerful lobbies,” in the wake of these charter applications. Organizations like the American Bankers Association (ABA) and Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) may attempt to take legal action or otherwise object to some charter applications, as the ICBA has most recently in a letter to the OCC, ""strongly"" opposing the attempt by Protego's subsidiary to enter the space. The outcome for Erebor, as well as the slew of stablecoin banking ventures popping up, depends on incumbents' litigiousness and on the ability for banking regulators to function as arbiters upholding some integrity within a multitrillion-dollar banking system.

“We know that [regulators] have deprioritized certain areas consistent with the policies of the current administration, but I would say, if not the federal banking agencies, who will regulate these banks?” Alt says.

Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by OpenAI's former chief technology officer Mira Murati, officially closed a $2 billion seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz on Monday, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

The deal, which includes participation from Nvidia, Accel, ServiceNow, CISCO, AMD, and Jane Street, values the startup at $12 billion, the spokesperson said.

Several outlets reported in June that Thinking Machines Lab was close to closing this $2 billion funding round at a $10 billion valuation, but, apparently, that valuation has shot up in the last month.

The deal marks one of the largest seed rounds — or first funding rounds — in Silicon Valley history, representing the massive investor appetite to back promising new AI labs. Thinking Machines Lab is less than a year old and has yet to reveal what it's working on.

However, Murati peeled back the curtain on the company's first product a bit in a post on X Tuesday, claiming that the startup plans to unveil its work in the “next couple months,” and it will include a “significant open source offering.” Murati also said the product will be useful for researchers and startups building custom AI models.

“Soon, we'll also share our best science to help the research community better understand frontier AI systems,” said Murati.

Thinking Machines Lab exists to empower humanity through advancing collaborative general intelligence.We're building multimodal AI that works with how you naturally interact with the world – through conversation, through sight, through the messy way we collaborate. We're…

It's unclear if Murati means that Thinking Machines Lab will release an open AI model, as some of OpenAI's other competitors have done to undercut the ChatGPT maker's offerings. A Thinking Machines Lab spokesperson declined to comment further.

Since Murati launched her venture, Thinking Machines Lab has attracted some of her former co-workers at OpenAI, including John Schulman, Barret Zoph, and Luke Metz. Murati says her company is currently trying to staff up, specifically for people with a track record of “building successful AI-driven products from the ground up,” according to the startup's website.

Meta reportedly held talks to acquire Thinking Machines Lab in recent months to bolster its superintelligence efforts, but they didn't progress to a final offer.

Thinking Machines Lab is one of a handful of AI startups that investors believe to be a legitimate threat to leading AI model developers today, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.

With billions in funding, Murati may have enough of a war chest to train frontier AI models. Thinking Machines Lab previously struck a deal with Google Cloud to power its AI models.

Surely, Thinking Machines Lab has an uphill battle to catch up with other AI labs. It's likely banking on novel research breakthroughs to set it apart; however, that's an increasingly difficult task as Meta, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI invest billions in their own research teams.

Billy McFarland, the fraudster who brought you Fyre Festival, has sold the rights to the brand on eBay for $245,300. We do not yet know who the buyer is or what they plan to do with such cursed IP.

Fyre Festival was a downright disaster. What was supposed to be a luxury music festival ended up stranding guests on an island in the Bahamas. Instead of lavish villas and gourmet meals, the festival's clientele, which included wealthy millennial influencers, got flimsy tents and famously unappetizing cheese sandwiches.

McFarland was later convicted of financial crimes due to his role in the festival, serving about three and a half years before he was released in 2022. But McFarland has not seemed to have learned his lesson. He tried organizing a second Fyre Festival, which was supposed to take place this summer in Mexico with tickets ranging between $1,400 and $1.1 million.

The second Fyre Festival never happened. Playa del Carmen, the Mexican city where McFarland said the festival would take place, claimed that there had not been any record of planning for the event, which did not have a permit. McFarland denied this, but announced a few weeks later that he would sell the Fyre Festival brand.

“Since 2017, FYRE has dominated headlines, documentaries, and conversations as one of the world's most talked-about music festivals,” McFarland wrote, failing to mention that the festival garnered so much attention due to its colossal failure. “There is a clear path for operators and entrepreneurs with strong domain expertise to build FYRE into a global force in entertainment, media, fashion, CPG, and more.”

The eBay auction says that a portion of the sale proceeds will go toward restitution — but McFarland owes $26 million, so this $245,300 sale isn't going to make much of an impact.

As publishers fret about decreased traffic from Google, the search giant has begun rolling out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google's search app on iOS and Android. Now, instead of seeing a headline from a major publication, users will see multiple news publishers' logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.

The app warns that these summaries are generated with AI, “which can make mistakes.”

The feature is not yet appearing for all news stories within the Google app. In tests, TechCrunch was able to view the AI summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S.

Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson confirmed this is not a test, but actually a U.S. launch. The feature will appear on iOS and Android in the U.S., with a focus on trending lifestyle topics like sports and entertainment. Google also noted the feature will make it easier for people to decide what pages they want to visit. 

In addition to the summaries, Google has been trying out other ways to present the news displayed in Discover. Though not flagged as powered by AI, some stories will include a set of bullet points below the headline or will be grouped with similar news.

For instance, a story about President Trump's Ukraine deal also included links to other stories about Trump's latest actions. Meanwhile, a story from The Washington Post about ICE was followed by bullet points that summarized the story's content. 

The update to the search app comes as a number of publishers have been experimenting with AI on their own sites, including The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, USA Today, and others. Startups, too, have gotten in on the action, as with Particle, a news reader that uses AI to not only summarize stories but also allow users to see different sides or ask follow-up questions to better understand the topic covered.

Despite these trials, there's significant concern in the publishing industry about how the shift to AI is impacting website traffic and referrals. With features like Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode, users no longer have to visit a website directly to get answers to their search queries — it can be summarized for them automatically or shared in a chatbot-style interface. Outside of Google, this same trend is seen across other AI apps, like ChatGPT or Perplexity.

Recently, Google tried to appease publishers with the launch of Offerwall, a feature that allows publishers to generate revenue beyond the more traffic-dependent options, like ads. With Offerwall, publishers who use Google Ad Manager can try out different methods to provide access to their content, like micropayments or having users take surveys, sign up for newsletters, watch ads, and more. 

But for many publishers, these tools are coming too late, as traffic is already in a steep decline.

A story by The Economist this week noted that worldwide search traffic fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, citing data from market intelligence company Similarweb.

Earlier data from the firm also found that the number of news searches on the web that result in no click-throughs to news websites had grown from 56% in May 2024, when AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% as of May 2025. Organic traffic also declined, dropping from over 2.3 billion visits at its peak in mid-2024 to fewer than 1.7 billion, it noted.

Amid this shift, Google Discover still remained a source for clicks, even as traffic from Google Search declined. But that may no longer be the case if the AI summaries roll out more broadly within the Google app. 

Updated after publication with Google's comment confirming it's a U.S. launch.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Tesla Makes a Desperate Move in Canada as Sales Collapse","https://gizmodo.com/tesla-makes-a-desperate-move-in-canada-as-sales-collapse-2000628708","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 20:33:07 GMT","

Tesla is making a desperate move to stay alive in Canada as its sales suffer from the fallout of Donald Trump's trade war. In a quiet but shocking update to its website, the electric vehicle maker has drastically lowered the price of its best-selling Model Y SUV by a staggering $20,000.

The move is a direct response to a brutal trade dispute that has crippled Tesla's Canadian operations. In retaliation for tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Ottawa slapped a 25% surtax on all cars imported from the United States starting on April 9, 2025. Faced with this new cost, Tesla had no choice but to raise the price of a Canadian Model Y to nearly CAD $84,990 (USD $61,500).

The result was catastrophic. According to reports from Electrek, the massive price hike caused demand to completely evaporate, with Tesla's sales in Canada grinding to a virtual halt in recent months. Tesla, which does not provide sales figures by region and country, saw its overall sales drop by 13.5% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.

Now, in a bid to reignite sales, Tesla has reversed course. The Model Y Long Range All-Wheel Drive now has a starting price of, according to the company's website, $64,990—a full $20,000 less than its peak. The likely explanation for this dramatic reversal is a major strategic pivot: the new, cheaper Model Ys are reportedly being imported from Tesla's Gigafactory in Berlin, Germany, allowing the company to bypass the steep tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.

While a win for new buyers, the decision has created a ludicrous pricing situation. The prices of other Tesla models, which are still sourced from the U.S., remain inflated by the surcharges. This means the Model Y, a popular SUV, is now significantly cheaper than the Model 3, Tesla's entry-level sedan. A quick check of Tesla's Canadian website shows the Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive starting at $70,772, nearly $6,000 more than the larger and more popular SUV.

The sudden price drop was widely discussed by Tesla fans and prospective buyers on X (formerly Twitter), with reactions ranging from shock and excitement to regret for those who bought just a few weeks too early.

“$20,000 Jesus,” one user exclaimed.

“Feel bad for those who paid 85K,” said another.

— Waldo (@curtd13) July 11, 2025



One user pointed out the strange new pricing dynamic: “The Model 3 is 79,990 The Model Y is 64,990 I wonder what they want to sell.”

The model 3 is 79,990 The model y is 64,990 

I wonder what they wanna sell 😆

— PlentyofZero (@random01097463) July 11, 2025



But for those who waited, the news was cause for celebration. “Awesome! Ordering one tomorrow!” another rejoiced.

Awesome !  Ordering one tomorrow !

— K C 189 (@kennystjohns) July 11, 2025



The move highlights Tesla's growing vulnerability in global markets as it faces mounting pressure from trade policies, intensifying EV competition, and erratic demand. It also underscores the unpredictability of Musk-era pricing, which has made buying a Tesla feel more like buying crypto: volatile, emotional, and occasionally rewarding.

For Canadian consumers, it may be a chance to score a deal. But for Tesla, it's a signal that its grip on global EV dominance may be slipping.

Cancer deaths related to obesity have risen sharply over the past two decades, especially among older adults, women, non-Hispanic Black individuals and people living with obesity in rural areas, a US study found.

“Obesity is a well-known risk factor for various cancers, but its contribution to cancer-specific mortality over time hasn't been systematically quantified at a national level,” lead investigator Faizan Ahmed, MD, with Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune City, New Jersey, told Medscape Medical News.

“Clinicians should recognize obesity not just as a cardiovascular or metabolic risk factor but as a significant oncologic concern,” Ahmed said.

He presented his research on July 13 at ENDO 2025, The Endocrine Society Annual Meeting in San Francisco.

According to the CDC, 40% of adults are living with obesity. Obesity is associated with a higher risk for 13 cancers, which make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed in the US each year.

They are adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, postmenopausal breast cancer, as well as cancer of the colon and rectum, uterus, gallbladder, upper stomach, kidneys, liver, ovaries, pancreas, thyroid, meningioma, and multiple myeloma.

To see the trends in obesity-associated cancer deaths over the past two decades, Ahmed and colleagues analyzed CDC data for 33,572 obesity and cancer-related deaths.

They found that the overall age-adjusted mortality rate gradually increased from 3.73 per million in 1999 to 13.52 per million in 2020. “That's more than a tripling in obesity-related cancer mortality rates over 20 years — a striking rise,” Ahmed told Medscape Medical News.

“To put it in context, this is a steeper increase than seen in many other chronic disease mortality trends during the same time period. It signals a rapidly escalating public health burden,” he noted.

Overall, the average percent change from 2018-2020 was +19.4%. The average annual percentage change was also statistically significant at 5.92 (P < .000001).

In stratified analyses, the overall age-adjusted mortality rate per million was greater in women than in men (7.22 vs 6.59), in non-Hispanic Black persons than in non-Hispanic White persons (9.20 vs 7.13), and in adults aged 65+ than those aged 25-64 (20.82 vs 3.54).

Age-adjusted mortality rates from obesity-associated cancers were also higher in rural than in urban areas (9.45 vs 6.40).

By region, overall, the Midwest had the highest rates and the Northeast had the lowest rates. State-level analysis revealed that Vermont, Minnesota, and Oklahoma had the highest rates, while Utah, Alabama, and Virginia had the lowest.

The link between obesity and cancer-related mortality is “often underappreciated,” Ahmed told Medscape Medical News.

“Our findings emphasize the need to prioritize obesity screening and management as part of comprehensive cancer prevention. Counseling patients on weight management should be reframed as a critical component of reducing long-term cancer risk,” he said.

Ahmed also noted that socioeconomic factors could be driving the increase in obesity-related cancer deaths.

“While BMI is a contributing factor, disparities in socioeconomic status, access to preventive care, delays in diagnosis, environmental exposures, and cultural factors likely play a larger role in the observed variations across gender and race.”

“For instance, women may face more delayed diagnoses due to under prioritized symptoms, and certain minority groups may encounter systemic barriers to cancer screening and obesity treatment,” Ahmed said.

To tackle the problem of rising rates of obesity-related cancer deaths, Ahmed said policy initiatives should move from downstream management to upstream prevention.

This would include “universal access to cancer screening programs, regardless of income or geography; public health campaigns that normalize obesity management as a cancer prevention strategy; policies promoting equitable access to healthy foods, physical activity, and early intervention services; incentives for primary care to integrate weight management into routine visits; and investment in community-based care models targeting underserved populations,” Ahmed told Medscape Medical News.

This study had no specific funding. Ahmed had no relevant disclosures.

BOGOTÁ, Colombia — While regular physical exercise is known to reduce the risk for a wide array of chronic diseases, its role in preventing psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has not been well studied. As a result, clinicians may hesitate to recommend vigorous exercise for patients with psoriasis because of concerns about potentially triggering joint inflammation in people with subclinical PsA.

But at the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2025 Annual Meeting and Trainee Symposium, Dylan McGagh, MD, a clinical research fellow in rheumatology at Oxford University, Oxford, England, presented evidence that regular exercise could in fact be preventive in this setting. People with prevalent psoriasis but no arthritis who walked more than 10,452 steps (approximately 4 miles) daily saw a 58% lower risk of developing PsA than those who walked very little, McGagh reported.

Moreover, risk was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, with every 1000 steps walked daily correlating to a 10% decrease.

Other measures of exercise also correlated to reduced risk, according to McGagh. “Any moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with reduced risk of PsA,” he said.

For his research, McGagh and his colleagues identified 2531 people (mean age, 63 years; 52% women; 100% White) with psoriasis from the UK Biobank Accelerometry Cohort, which enrolled more than 100,000 people aged 40-65 years between 2013 and 2015. Participants used wearable accelerometers for a median of 7 days to track their movement patterns. They were then followed for up to 8 years, with health records linked.

“We were interested in people with prevalent psoriasis without PsA,” McGagh said at the conference. “We modeled a range of exposures, including steps, peak walking cadence or walking speed, change in hazards per 1000 increase in steps,” and time spent in sedentary and active states.

Higher volume and intensity of physical activity were also associated with lower risk. “The message here is that basically any small amount of activity is beneficial” — something easily conveyed to patients, he said. “But we need to verify this in more diverse cohorts, and there's a need to characterize physical activity profile across the [disease] continuum,” he cautioned.

The findings were received with interest at a meeting intensely focused on the potential effects of diet, exercise, and body composition on the development of PsA in people with psoriasis, even outside the context of obesity, a known risk factor for PsA in patients with psoriasis. For example, the conference began with a lively debate on whether there is sufficient evidence to recommend treatment with GLP-1 agonists in certain patients who have or are at risk for PsA.

Gary Macfarlane, MD, PhD, of the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland, an epidemiologist specializing in musculoskeletal disease who also presented at the meeting, said in an interview that he found McGagh's results encouraging. Lifestyle interventions are “powerful” in improving health outcomes in people, he said. “Let's get people more active. That will improve their mental health as well,” he added.

McGagh was awarded a pilot grant by GRAPPA to continue his research. In an interview at the conference, he commented that this was the first study to “really put physical activity in the driver's seat in that story of transition” from psoriasis to PsA. He also cautioned that his study cohort was comprised entirely of White individuals, an important weakness of the study, and that the participants with psoriasis were older than typical patients with psoriasis at risk for PsA.

The findings need to be replicated in more representative cohorts, “and we're working right now to do this,” McGagh said. In the meantime, he said, clinicians should consider it safe to recommend exercise to patients with psoriasis.

McGagh disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest. Macfarlane has received fees and/or research funding from AbbVie, Pfizer, and others.

In a comprehensive Genomic Press perspective (peer-reviewed review) article, an international team of neuroscientists has outlined crucial validity standards that could transform how researchers use stem cell technology to study devastating brain disorders. The framework addresses a critical gap in translating laboratory discoveries into effective treatments for neuropsychiatric conditions that affect billions globally.

Neuropsychiatric disorders represent one of medicine's greatest challenges, impacting over 3 billion individuals worldwide while profoundly affecting social, economic, and personal wellbeing. Despite significant advances in uncovering genetic causes through large-scale sequencing efforts, the path from genetic discovery to clinical application remains frustratingly elusive. This translation gap has left patients waiting for precision medicine approaches that could transform treatment outcomes.

The new perspective, led by Dr. Nael Nadif Kasri at Radboud University Medical Center, proposes that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers unprecedented opportunities to bridge this divide. These revolutionary cellular models allow scientists to grow human brain cells and even miniature brain organoids from patient skin or blood samples, capturing the exact genetic makeup of individuals with neuropsychiatric conditions.

""Human iPSC-derived two-dimensional neurons and glia, and three-dimensional organoids recapitulate key aspects of brain development and cellular functions,"" the authors explain, highlighting how these models enable disease study on genetically relevant backgrounds. What distinguishes this approach from previous efforts is the systematic application of validity criteria traditionally used for animal models, now adapted specifically for human cellular systems.

The framework rests on three interconnected validity types that researchers must consider when developing iPSC models. Construct validity ensures the model contains appropriate genetic alterations and relevant cell types. For monogenic disorders like Timothy syndrome or Rett syndrome, this means including disease-causing mutations in the correct cellular context. However, the challenge intensifies for polygenic conditions like schizophrenia, where thousands of genetic variants contribute to disease risk.

Face validity addresses whether iPSC models exhibit characteristics resembling the human condition. Since behavioral symptoms define most psychiatric disorders, researchers must identify molecular and cellular features that correlate with clinical manifestations. The authors highlight innovative approaches, such as using microelectrode arrays to measure neuronal activity patterns that mirror electroencephalography abnormalities seen in patients. Could these electrical signatures serve as translatable biomarkers linking cellular dysfunction to clinical symptoms?

Predictive validity represents perhaps the most clinically relevant criterion, focusing on whether models accurately predict patient treatment responses. The perspective showcases compelling examples where iPSC-derived neurons from lithium-responsive and non-responsive bipolar disorder patients showed differential drug effects matching clinical outcomes. This personalized approach raises intriguing possibilities for precision psychiatry. Might future patients receive customized treatment recommendations based on their own cellular responses tested in laboratory dishes?

Creating valid iPSC models presents numerous technical challenges that researchers must navigate carefully. Genomic instability during reprogramming can introduce unwanted mutations, potentially confounding results. The authors emphasize regular genomic integrity assessments to ensure models remain representative of patient genetics. Additionally, selecting appropriate cell types proves crucial yet complex, particularly for disorders involving multiple brain regions and cellular interactions.

The developmental stage of iPSC models poses another consideration. Current protocols generate cells resembling fetal brain tissue from first and second trimesters, raising questions about modeling disorders that manifest later in life. How can researchers capture disease processes that unfold over decades within cellular systems that mirror early development? This temporal mismatch demands creative solutions and careful interpretation of results.

The perspective highlights pioneering studies demonstrating successful model validation across all three criteria. Research on 22q11.2 deletion syndrome exemplifies this comprehensive approach, combining patient brain imaging data with iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons to reveal altered dopamine metabolism linking genetic changes to schizophrenia risk. Such multi-level validation strengthens confidence in model relevance.

Brain organoids offer particularly exciting possibilities for capturing complex cellular interactions. Studies have shown these three-dimensional cultures develop oscillatory patterns resembling neonatal electroencephalography recordings, providing a window into network-level dysfunction. When organoids from Rett syndrome patients displayed epileptiform activity that responded to therapeutic compounds, it demonstrated the potential for drug discovery using validated human models.

The proposed validity framework arrives at a pivotal moment for neuropsychiatric research. As iPSC technology matures, standardized validation criteria become essential for ensuring reproducible, translatable findings. The authors suggest starting model development from any validity pillar depending on available information. Known medication responders provide entry points for predictive validity, while genetic discoveries enable construct validity approaches.

Several questions emerge for the field to address. How might researchers incorporate environmental factors that interact with genetic predisposition in these models? Could combinations of different validity assessments create composite scores for model quality? What role might artificial intelligence play in identifying subtle phenotypes linking cellular dysfunction to clinical outcomes?

The framework also highlights opportunities for studying rare variants and personalized medicine approaches. With each patient potentially harboring unique genetic combinations, iPSC models offer platforms for testing individualized therapeutic strategies. This capability becomes particularly valuable for treatment-resistant cases where standard approaches fail.

Beyond improving disease understanding, validated iPSC models could revolutionize drug development pipelines. Traditional psychiatric medications show limited advancement over treatments introduced decades ago. Human cellular models meeting rigorous validity standards might identify novel therapeutic targets and predict individual treatment responses before clinical trials.

The integration of multiple validation approaches strengthens model reliability. Combining electrophysiological recordings, molecular profiling, and drug response data creates comprehensive pictures of disease mechanisms. As researchers build libraries of validated models across diverse genetic backgrounds, patterns may emerge revealing convergent pathways amenable to therapeutic intervention.

Implementing these validity standards requires collaboration across disciplines and institutions. The authors emphasize close partnerships with clinicians who provide crucial patient data and treatment histories. Standardized protocols and data sharing will accelerate progress toward clinically relevant models. International consortiums could establish model repositories with detailed validation data, enabling researchers worldwide to access characterized systems.

The perspective underscores how technological advances continue expanding possibilities. Single-cell sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity within models, while advanced imaging captures dynamic processes in living organoids. These tools, combined with rigorous validity assessment, position the field for breakthrough discoveries.

As neuropsychiatric disorders continue affecting billions globally, the need for better models and treatments intensifies. This comprehensive validity framework provides a roadmap for developing iPSC models that genuinely capture disease biology and predict therapeutic outcomes. By establishing clear standards and encouraging systematic validation, researchers move closer to realizing the promise of precision psychiatry, where treatments match individual patient biology rather than diagnostic categories alone.

Chelsea may have claimed the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, but according to Donald Trump, the original tournament trophy remains at the White House.

The English Premier League power stunned observers in Sunday's final by rolling past Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, an upset to cap off the first edition of a massively expanded tournament. President Trump — who spent plenty of time ahead of the event bonding with FIFA head Gianni Infantino — made his presence known after the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., taking the field to boos before lingering among Chelsea players in an awkward trophy ceremony.

Eventually, Chelsea captain Reece James managed to hoist the trophy, designed by Tiffany and Co. and inspired by the Voyager space probes. Still, per the president, that may not have been the same trophy that has spent much of the last few months sitting in the Oval Office.

Here's what President Trump said about the Club World Cup trophy:

On Sunday, Club World Cup broadcaster DAZN conducted an interview with President Trump, who declared that he was told by FIFA that the trophy originally unveiled at the White House back in March could remain there in perpetuity.

""I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' claimed Trump, before stating that FIFA officials replied, ""'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one.' And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.""

FIFA had not previously announced plans to make a second Club World Cup trophy, while Chelsea's official Instagram page included a photo of airplane pilots holding the trophy — replica or not — before the team departed for London.

The Club World Cup trophy seems to have become part of the decor in the Oval Office since Infantino joined Trump to reveal its design to the world. It has been present for some soccer-related moments, like a bizarre event where the president offered his take on world affairs while confused-looking Juventus players stood in the background. However, it has also remained in the Oval Office during moments with no soccer context, lingering in the background as Trump awarded Elon Musk a key to the White House in May, among other instances.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Chelsea may have claimed the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, but according to Donald Trump, the original tournament trophy remains at the White House.

The English Premier League power stunned observers in Sunday's final by rolling past Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, an upset to cap off the first edition of a massively expanded tournament. President Trump — who spent plenty of time ahead of the event bonding with FIFA head Gianni Infantino — made his presence known after the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., taking the field to boos before lingering among Chelsea players in an awkward trophy ceremony.

Eventually, Chelsea captain Reece James managed to hoist the trophy, designed by Tiffany and Co. and inspired by the Voyager space probes. Still, per the president, that may not have been the same trophy that has spent much of the last few months sitting in the Oval Office.

Here's what President Trump said about the Club World Cup trophy:

On Sunday, Club World Cup broadcaster DAZN conducted an interview with President Trump, who declared that he was told by FIFA that the trophy originally unveiled at the White House back in March could remain there in perpetuity.

""I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' claimed Trump, before stating that FIFA officials replied, ""'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one.' And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.""

FIFA had not previously announced plans to make a second Club World Cup trophy, while Chelsea's official Instagram page included a photo of airplane pilots holding the trophy — replica or not — before the team departed for London.

The Club World Cup trophy seems to have become part of the decor in the Oval Office since Infantino joined Trump to reveal its design to the world. It has been present for some soccer-related moments, like a bizarre event where the president offered his take on world affairs while confused-looking Juventus players stood in the background. However, it has also remained in the Oval Office during moments with no soccer context, lingering in the background as Trump awarded Elon Musk a key to the White House in May, among other instances.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Jannik Sinner and the retiring Darren Cahill offered interesting replies when they were asked if the Australian would reconsider his decision to quit after the 2025 season following the Italian's Wimbledon triumph.

Cahill, who mentored former world No 1s Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi, has been part of Sinner's camp since July 2022, sharing all the coaching duties with Simone Vagnozzi.

Under their guidance, the Italian went from rising star of the game to one of the biggest names in tennis as he won two Australian Open titles, the 2024 US Open and most recently Wimbledon. He also became the first Italian to become No 1 in the ATP Rankings when he climbed to the top in June 2024.

But Sinner has been searching for a new coach since the start of the year as Cahill informed the 23-year-old that he would retire from coaching at the end of this season.

Following Sinner's four-set win over Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, the Australian was asked during the post-match press conference if he would reconsider the decision to retire and replied: “I don't want to answer this (smiling).

“You know what, you just need to ask Jannik that. Ask Jannik. Are you guys going to be in the press conference with him?”

ATP Rankings battle for No 1 spot: When could Carlos Alcaraz overtake Jannik Sinner at the top?

During the Italian portion of Sinner's press conference the question was put to the newly-crowned Wimbledon champion.

“It depends. Whether I want to tell the truth or not,” he started off before revealing they had a bet and the ball is now firmly in his court when it comes to Cahill's future.

“We had a bet before the final. He said: ‘If you win tomorrow, you can decide whether or not I stay.' Now the choice is mine. I've always looked for a person who is honest, a person who gives me a lot, not necessarily only on the tennis court, but [about] how to live.”

If Cahill – who received the ATP Coach of the Year Award in 2023 alongside Vagnozzi – does indeed stay on, then he is unlikely to accompany Sinner on a full-time basis with Vagnozzi likely to fulfil that role.

The four-time Grand Slam winner added: “The season is long. There are a lot of tournaments. You never know. But let's just say I won the bet, and so we'll see what happens.”


                Jannik Sinner once again comfortable at No 1, but for how long?            


                ""Jannik has always been very focused; his personality is unique.""

The menu was as elite as the guest list at Wimbledon's Champions' Dinner this year, with tennis royalty gathered in black tie at Raffles London at The OWO - a luxury hotel and event space in Whitehall, central London.

The evening marked a glittering finale to a fortnight of tennis in SW19, where Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek were triumphant in the men's and women's singles events respectively.

The gala is hosted by the All England Club to honour the tournament's champions alongside dignitaries and sponsors.

It is tradition for Wimbledon champions to pose with their trophies during the dinner, with the men's and women's singles winners often sharing a dance as a highlight of the evening.

Sinner and Swiatek obliged on Sunday night, stepping on the stage for a brief, 20‑second dance to 'Feel It Still' by Portugal. The Man.

But before the dancing began, guests were treated to a decadent three-course meal.

A post shared by Harriet Dart (@harriet_dart)

To start, diners enjoyed an Orkney scallop, paired with a pumpkin risotto, shavings of 24-month aged Parmesan, and a drizzle of rosemary chicken jus.

The main course featured slow-cooked Hereford beef fillet, accompanied by potato dauphinoise, carrots, braised short rib, and a helping of red wine jus.

For dessert, a summery Eton mess arrived with blackberries, passionfruit, and a touch of Bermondsey bees honey.

The meal was paired with a thoughtful wine selection, including a La Rose Creation, a 2022 French Chablis, and a 2023 Chianti from Italy.

Swiatek won the women's tournament in just 57 minutes, double-bageling American Amanda Anisimova in emphatic fashion on Saturday, to become the first Polish singles champion.

Then on Sunday, Sinner took on double defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the second installment of a growing rivalry at the top of men's tennis, avenging his defeat from the French Open just over a month ago.

Both stars were dressed for the occasion - Swiatek wore a glamourous lilac gown by Stella McCartney worth more than $2,000 (£1494).

And Sinner, who is an ambassador for Italian fashion house Gucci, sported a custom dark suit and tie with a pair of the brand's signature loafers. 

The Italian revealed to BBC Sport how emotional he was after securing a memorable four-set victory over Alcaraz for his fourth major crown, describing it as 'the most amazing thing' that could have happened to him.

'Only me and the people who are close to me know exactly what we have been through on and off the court, and it has been everything except easy,' he said.

'[It is] very emotional, even if I don't cry. To share this moment with my whole family here, it's the most amazing thing that could have happened to me.'

Sinner's victory came just 10 weeks after he returned from a three-month ban following two positive tests for banned substance clostebol.

Meanwhile, Swiatek, whose final was far more routine in its brutality, admitted her triumph was beyond even her own dreams.

'It seems super surreal,' the now six-time Grand Slam champion admitted after her 6-0, 6-0 victory.

'Honestly, I didn't even dream of winning Wimbledon because it was way too far. I feel like I'm an experienced player, having won other Slams, but I didn't expect this.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

The 23-year-old American tennis star has jumped to World No. 7 in WTA rankings.

Amanda Anisimova had the best Grand Slam finish of her career at The Wimbledon Championships, and though she fell short to Iga Świątek in the final, the American tennis star is taking away some unmatched memories and lessons for her next major of the season.

""It was such a remarkable experience for me, and making it to the first Grand Slam final and it being at Wimbledon was a surreal feeling,"" the 23-year-old said in a new interview with ""Good Morning America.""

""Even though it didn't go the way I would have wanted it to go, my opponent obviously was was playing some great tennis, and I've had to compete against so many incredible athletes throughout the entire fortnight,"" she continued.

Despite her runner-up finish, Anisimova has since jumped up the WTA rankings, breaking into the top 10 for the first time at No. 7.

""It feels so surreal to be ranked [No.] 7 right now -- it's my career high and what a quick turnaround for me,"" she told ""GMA.""

Anisimova added that there were larger takeaways, like having her family present and ""getting to experience that moment with me,"" which she called ""incredibly special.""

""Getting to meet Kate Middleton after the final at the ceremony, there were so many special moments and so many other things that I can take away apart from the performance in itself,"" she added.

The New Jersey native took a hiatus from the professional circuit in May 2023 until January 2024 to focus on her mental health and said that ""it's been quite the journey coming back.""

""The most important thing for me since coming back has honestly been doing everything on my own terms and just enjoying the moment,"" she said. ""And that's what I told myself coming out into Wimbledon. I was just incredibly excited to just be playing in the main draw, because I didn't make it last year.""

Anisimova made history as the youngest American woman singles player to advance to the Wimbledon finals -- after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka -- since Serena Williams.

""Getting to play on on Centre Court and winning against the most incredible athlete in tennis right now was super special to me and just an exhilarating feeling,"" she said. ""It'll last me a lifetime of memories for sure.""

The iconic All England Lawn Tennis venue brought with it some very posh quirks, including champagne bottles popping mid-match that prompted officials to silence spectators.

""That was like the 15th time, so I think that my reaction was valid -- it was just a reminder of where I was,"" Anisimova recalled. ""It felt very English -- but it was a funny experience for sure. And then after the match, I was able to laugh about it afterwards, of course.""

With the final major of the season just over a month out, Anisimova said she's excited to return to Queens and get on the courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

""The U.S. Open is my favorite tournament by far. It's always super exciting to be playing there, and I'm sure I'll have the whole home crowd cheering for me over there,"" she said. ""Again, all of my family is going to come and support me -- I am sure it's going to be a great tournament. And hopefully I can go far again.""

Sabalenka is the current defending women's singles U.S. Open champion.

Anisimova has competed five times in the main draw. Her best U.S. Open finish was reaching the third round in 2020.

When asked whether the addition of a new coach was of consideration to assist with the situation, Zverev responded, “Possibly. As I said, it's a different feeling right now for me. I can't speak for the moment. But I think I'll have answers by Canada.”Despite the early departure in London, Zverev still stands at No. 4 in the race to the Nitto ATP Finals.

Nico Hulkenberg's 15-year wait for a podium

After Nico Hulkenberg's climb from P19 to the podium in the British Grand Prix, F1.com looks back at some of the most impressive rises to the rostrum in the sport's history.

In a result that perhaps few would have predicted beforehand, Nico Hulkenberg rose from the back of the grid to third place in the British Grand Prix to seal his long-awaited first podium. The Kick Sauber man's performance has earned its place on the list of impressive rises to the rostrum – so, to mark that, we've been taking a look back at 10 other remarkable drives to the podium…

Hulkenberg had lined up in P19 on race day at Silverstone – and Rubens Barrichello found himself in a similar position ahead of the German Grand Prix in 2000, the Brazilian ending up in P18 on the grid at Hockenheim after his car suffered electrical issues in Qualifying.

While Ferrari team mate – and championship leader – Michael Schumacher found himself out of the running on Lap 1 following a collision with Benetton's Giancarlo Fisichella, Barrichello started to carve his way through the field in a race featuring changing weather conditions.

The driver from Sao Paulo handled the subsequent chaos of others crashing, Safety Car phases and further heavy rain to clinch his debut victory in F1, leading to emotional scenes on the podium as Barrichello tearfully processed his achievement.

Barrichello went on to achieve a total of 11 victories in Formula 1 – and while none of these took place at his home race, one driver to claim a particularly memorable win in Sao Paulo is Max Verstappen, who pulled off a remarkable comeback drive at the 2024 event.

Race day in Brazil had already proven frenetic hours before the Grand Prix, with Qualifying taking place earlier on Sunday after being postponed owing to Saturday's treacherous weather conditions.

Amid five red flags in the session after several crashes, another big shock occurred when Verstappen exited Q2 in 12th place, which then became 17th on the grid due to a five-place penalty for using a new power unit.

This did not deter the Red Bull driver, who made numerous overtakes to climb up the order during a chaotic rain-affected race – and, after taking the lead from Alpine's Esteban Ocon just past the halfway point, the Dutchman was untouchable as he stormed to a stunning victory.

Brazil has certainly seen its fair share of eventful races over the years, with Verstappen's first Interlagos win some five years earlier also featuring an impressive rise through the field from his former team mate, Carlos Sainz.

After a challenging few seasons, McLaren looked to be on an upward trajectory in 2019, the team scoring a solid haul of points via their new line-up of Sainz and Lando Norris.

A decent result looked like it would be harder to come by at the penultimate round in Sao Paulo, however, with Sainz forced to start from the back of the grid following a loss of power during Saturday's Qualifying.

Despite this, the Spaniard made a one-stop strategy work in his favour on Sunday as he powered through from P20 to cross the line in P4 – and with third-placed Lewis Hamilton later receiving a five-second penalty for a collision with Alex Albon, Sainz was promoted to third, handing him his maiden top-three result as well as marking McLaren's first podium finish since 2014.

Needless to say, there were countless moments of Ayrton Senna brilliance across his career in Formula 1 – and one of these occurred early on for the Brazilian as F1 hit the streets of Monaco during his debut campaign in 1984.

In his fifth Grand Prix start – and first at a street circuit – Senna had put his Toleman in P13 on the grid and went on to display his skill at driving in the wet during a race that saw others struggle in the damp conditions.

His progression through the field saw him work his way up to P2 behind future title rival Alain Prost, the Frenchman leading at the wheel of his McLaren.

Senna went on to pass Prost, but the decision was then taken to stop the race owing to the conditions, with the countback placing Senna in second place at the final order. While he had to wait a little longer for his debut victory, the future World Champion had well and truly made his mark with his storming drive.

When F1 raced in Sakhir for the penultimate round of the 2020 campaign, Sergio Perez was facing an uncertain future amid the news that the Mexican would be replaced at Racing Point – soon to be known as Aston Martin – by Sebastian Vettel in 2021.

As he searched for a new team, Perez had put in some good performances through 2020 including a second place in Turkey, but his prospects in Sakhir did not initially appear so promising after a collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1 dropped him to the back of the pack.

However, Perez was a man on the move throughout the ensuing race, climbing the order before later benefitting from the misfortunes of Mercedes up ahead to surge into the lead and grab his first-ever F1 victory.

The Mexican admitted to being left “speechless” by the result, which came on his 190th Grand Prix start – and it seemed to be enough to prove to Red Bull that Perez was deserving of a drive, the team announcing within a matter of weeks that they had signed him for 2021.

Lewis Hamilton has put in more than one impressive recovery drive during his glittering F1 career to date – and one of the most memorable came at the Belgian Grand Prix in 2016, a year famed for the Briton's fierce title fight with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton arrived into the weekend as the championship leader, 19 points clear of Rosberg, but a number of grid penalties for changing engine components meant that the British driver would start the race at Spa-Francorchamps from the back.

Drama for some of the frontrunners on the opening lap allowed Hamilton to move up to P15, and from there onwards he stayed out of trouble and handled subsequent Safety Car phases and a red flag to cross the line in third place.

Alongside the fact that this damage limitation allowed Hamilton to maintain his championship lead, the World Champion also notched up the unique statistic of becoming the first driver to have taken a podium from 20th on the grid or lower on three occasions.

When it comes to dramatic events in the sport's history, the Canadian Grand Prix in 2011 has well and truly earned its place in F1 lore.

As well as becoming the longest Formula 1 race ever – at four hours, four minutes and 39 seconds, to be exact – it was made all the more memorable by Jenson Button bouncing back from numerous incidents to seal an against-the-odds victory.

After an early clash with McLaren team mate Lewis Hamilton dropped him backwards, Button's afternoon went on to feature everything from a puncture to a drive-through penalty – just one of his six visits to the pits – and a last lap overtake for the lead on Sebastian Vettel to secure an incredible victory.

“It felt like I spent more time in the pits than on the pit straights,” Button joked afterwards as he reflected back on his extraordinary comeback drive.

Having already achieved two wins during the 1967 season, Jim Clark looked on course to add to this tally when he secured pole position for the ninth round of the campaign at Monza.

The Briton held the lead as the race got underway, but a puncture on Lap 12 saw him drop one lap behind the rest of the field – resulting in the two-time World Champion embarking on a remarkable fightback.

After picking off numerous cars, Clark had hauled himself back into P1 with eight laps remaining. But the Scot's victory chances were again dashed when his Lotus experienced a fuel issue on the final tour, meaning that he was passed by John Surtees and Jack Brabham.

Despite this, Clark still held onto third place in a drive that has been revered by many as one of his greatest.

The 2012 season was a highly competitive one, with a different driver each taking victory across the opening seven rounds of the year.

Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel had embarked on a strong run in the second half of the campaign, the Red Bull driver having won four consecutive races when F1 arrived in Abu Dhabi for the third to last round of the season.

But when officials had been unable to take a fuel sample from his car post-Qualifying, Vettel – who was by this point engaged in a close title fight with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso – was excluded from the results and started the race from the pit lane.

An eventful afternoon followed for the German driver, who recovered from front wing damage early on to pull off a series of overtakes on his rivals. This culminated in a daring move on Jenson Button's McLaren, securing Vettel a stunning podium result in P3 en route to winning his third World Championship at the end of the year.

This list would simply not be complete without a mention of John Watson's history-making win at the Long Beach Street Circuit in 1983.

Qualifying had not gone well for Watson and his McLaren team mate Niki Lauda, the pair finding themselves down in P22 and P23 respectively after tyre struggles during the session.

However, the picture looked very different on race day, with Watson and Lauda both carving their way through the pack to eventually find themselves running in a 1-2 formation.

As Lauda was affected by leg cramps during the latter stages, the Austrian was unable to challenge his team mate and Watson crossed the line to take the win some 27 seconds clear. Having started down in 22nd place, the Northern Irishman continues to hold the record for the lowest grid slot that a win has been taken from.

After completing the first half of his debut season for Williams, Carlos Sainz is hoping to turn his run of bad luck around as the campaign progresses.

Carlos Sainz has given his reflections on what has been a “tough” run of races for himself and Williams during the first half of the season, with the Spaniard stating that “everything that could go wrong this year so far has gone wrong for me”.

The Grove-based outfit are currently holding fifth place in the Teams' Championship on 59 points, putting them 18 points clear of closest rivals Kick Sauber in sixth.

However, 46 of these points have been earned by Alex Albon, with Sainz facing a run of difficult weekends that has seen him fail to score since a P10 finish in Canada.

The 30-year-old was unable to start the Austrian Grand Prix due to an issue with his car, while contact with the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc dropped him down the order one week later at Silverstone, meaning that he crossed the line in P12.

Asked earlier on in the British Grand Prix weekend about what he had learned so far in the first half of the season, Sainz conceded: “Definitely we are going through a tough period with reliability issues, with weekend execution problems as you could see [in Austria], and the last few weekends I think have been extremely difficult for us as a team.

“For me on my side of the garage, running through multiple issues in Qualifying and the race, the one thing that keeps me hopeful and confident is that my speed has always been there throughout the year.

“So that's something that we need to just bank on and make sure that we stop making these mistakes and making the kind of issues that are hampering us in important moments of the weekend.”

Reflecting further on the problems that have afflicted him at several races, Sainz reiterated that he is still taking positives from the fact that he feels comfortable in the Williams FW47.

“I think everything that could go wrong this year so far has gone wrong for me, and it's been a run of races where we've had highlights and some good moments, but in the majority of it it's been very scrappy from every part involved,” the four-time race winner explained.

“We're keen to get this run of bad races to an end, because we're making too many mistakes for the car that we have.

“The one thing that keeps me smiling is the speed that I have in the car and with the team, and I know we should be finishing every weekend as top of the midfield, except for maybe Barcelona and a few other places.

“The speed is there, I feel comfortable in the car, we just don't seem to get a break in terms of luck and execution of the weekend [and] reliability.

“Just way too many issues for the car we have, but at some point it's going to end and as soon as I get a bit of momentum going I know what we're capable of doing.”

Sainz will be hoping for better when Formula 1 heads to Belgium for the next round on the calendar during the weekend of July 25-27.

Amid continued speculation over Max Verstappen's future, Jenson Button has given his take on how a switch to Mercedes could play out for the Dutchman – and what the situation could hold for George Russell.

Jenson Button has admitted that he would “love” to see Max Verstappen and George Russell become team mates at Mercedes amid continued speculation about the Dutchman's future, though the 2009 World Champion also suggested that changing teams could be “tricky” for Verstappen.

Talk surrounding a possible move to the Silver Arrows for Verstappen grew in Austria when Russell – whose current deal runs until the end of 2025 – told Sky Sports F1 that it was ""only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing"".

Facing questions about the situation one week later at the British Grand Prix, Verstappen remained tight-lipped as he stated: ""I have nothing to add. What I said last week. Other people write stuff, that's great but it's not for me.""

Former Team Principal Christian Horner – speaking before his exit from the team – also dismissed the speculation as “a lot of noise” as he reiterated that Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull through to the end of 2028.

During an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X, Button was asked about how possible a straight swap between Verstappen and Russell might be, to which he answered: “I mean, possible.”

However, the Briton also acknowledged that a change of team could pose some challenges for Verstappen, who has spent all of his F1 career to date within the Red Bull fold.

“It's a tricky one for Max, because he's in a position where he's doing so well with Red Bull – they've given him so much over the years,” said Button. “They've designed this car around him, and he's extremely good at it. Nobody can match him in that car.

“They're so far off him. I mean, him qualifying third or fourth, and them qualifying 18th. If he goes to Mercedes, it's a different thing altogether. You know, that car is not going to be designed around him. So, is it going to work for him? I don't know.

“I mean, the best in the world should be able to make that work for him. It's a tough one on George, because George is at the top of his game. I think he's been so competitive. When you see what he did against Lewis [Hamilton] in the last few years, he is World Championship material.

“So, to replace Max with him, it just seems like a strange move. I know they've got the young Kimi Antonelli, who's 18, who could be a future star. But we still don't know that.

“Whereas George is there, he is good, and you need two very competitive drivers with this new era of the sport. Next year, obviously lots of regulation changes, car change, engine change. So, for me, George and Max would be a better line-up.”

Pushed on whether he could see such a partnership working – with Verstappen and Russell having shared some contentious moments on track in recent times – Button conceded: “I would love to see it!”

Tune into The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X weekdays from 6:30am – 10am and on Global Player.

All moviegoers were evacuated during the incident but most auditoriums — including one of the largest Imax screens in the world — suffered no damage and are back in business.

	Where's Superman when you need him?


	A torrential downpour in New York City and surrounding areas on Monday night forced AMC Lincoln Square 13 — one of the busiest theaters in the country — to evacuate moviegoers and shut down.




	The heavy downpour caused damage to a roof pipe, which led to a significant amount of water coming into a portion of the lower levels of the building, according to a statement from AMC Theatres.


	The Lincoln Square cinema was able to reopen late Tuesday morning, although auditoriums on the bottom floor and other affected areas of the theater will remain closed until the cleanup work is finished.

	There was no damage to the much-in-demand Imax auditorium, which houses one of the largest Imax screens in the world (it's estimated to be 10 stories high). Ditto for the Dolby Cinema auditorium, among many others. Imax and Dolby are both currently playing James Gunn and DC Studio's Superman, with seat maps showing numerous showtimes on Tuesday almost at capacity.


	Videos of Monday evening's flood quickly found their way to social media. One widely circulated video posted to TikTok showed water gushing into a concession area on the lower floor of the multistory cinema. Citizen NYC also monitored the unfolding situation.

	AMC said refunds will be issued automatically for tickets purchased to any affected showtimes on Monday and Tuesday. The circuit, which is the largest theater chain in the country and world, said none of its other theaters in New York or elsewhere nearby were impacted by storm and reiterated that Lincoln Square was a one-off event because of the broken pipe.

	











	Officials said the storm left at least two people dead. In Central Park, more than 2 inches of rain fell in less than an hour, a near-record amount. Some subway lines were also flooded, with road closures and transit delays extending into Tuesday. And a state of emergency was in effect in New Jersey.

The July 5 ""Back to the Beginning"" show raised more than $200 million for three charities, surpassing the amount raised by FireAid and Farm Aid combined.


													By
												

	Elizabeth Dilts Marshall



Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath‘s “Back to the Beginning” raised more money than any charity concert since George Harrison and Ravi Shankar‘s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh popularized the very idea of an all-star benefit show, according to a review of Billboard‘s coverage over the years.


	The heavy metal show, billed as Osbourne's final stage performance, raised roughly $190 million in charitable donations on July 5, according to an Instagram post from the event's musical director, Tom Morello. Notably, that was a big jump from the $140 million Morello said the event raised in an earlier Instagram story, but the event's promoters did not respond to requests for clarification.


	According to statements from the group and its charity partners, the concert, watched by 40,000 ticketholders and 5.8 million individuals online, will distribute funds equally to Birmingham Children's Hospital, Acorn Children's Hospice and Cure Parkinson's — an organization dedicated to finding a cure for the disease Osbourne has lived with since 2019. It is unclear yet what the final donation to each charity will be. 


	Each of those charities said they were able to raise tens of thousands of pounds in additional donations by raffling off tickets to the show, auctioning off iconic art and band photographs donated by Black Sabbath, and through individual contributions from fans as they streamed into the concert, which took place at Villa Park in Birmingham, England.


	While impossible to fact-check so soon after the event, that figure surpasses the amount raised by many of the highest-profile charity concerts of all time, according to a review of Billboard's coverage over the years. Notably, reports from Billboard and other media outlets have relied on figures provided by people affiliated with these concerts, as promoters are not required to publish the total funds raised or how much is deducted to cover expenses. We will strive to update this list with more and better information as we get it. Email ediltsmarshall@billboard.com with any tips.


Here's a list of some of the highest-grossing charity concerts of all time, according to each event's organizers.


FireAid, the five-hour-long mega-concert that featured performances by Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga and Green Day in January 2025, raised more than $100 million for victims of the Los Angeles wildfires that killed 29 people and destroyed more than 16,000 homes earlier that same month. The group began distributing the first $50 million worth of grants to community-based organizations in February.


Live Aid festival, held on July 13, 1985, at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia and broadcast live to an estimated 1 billion viewers in 110 countries, raised roughly $100 million for famine relief in the countries of Ethiopia and Sudan. Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof raised another $10 million for those ravaged by famine before the festival through the release of “Do They Know It's Christmas?”, the best-selling British single that featured U2 and Phil Collins. An additional $60 million was raised for the cause through the release of “We Are The World,” written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie.


Willie Nelson's Farm Aid, the music industry's longest-running charity concert that launched in 1985 to support family farmers hurt by the downturn in the market value of American crops, has raised more than $80 million to support family farmers over the past 40 years. In the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of American farms filed for bankruptcy, with the bankruptcy rate among farmers in 1987 topping the rate just before the Great Depression, U.S.D.A. filings show. According to Billboard, among the first funds dispersed from the charity was a $100,000 check Nelson wrote to a church group that used the money to feed farm families.


	Organized by George Clooney and Haiti-born rapper Wyclef Jean, “Hope for Haiti Now” was a telethon that raised more than $57 million for the island country after the devastating magnitude-7 quake that killed some 200,000 people and left 3 million hurt or homeless in January 2010. Artists like Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z and Chris Martin performed songs as celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman took donations by phone. Proceeds from the fundraiser were distributed through the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, the U.N. World Food Program, Oxfam America, the Red Cross, UNICEF and Yele Haiti Foundation.


	The Concert for Bangladesh was actually a pair of sold-out Madison Square Garden shows organized by former Beatles guitarist Harrison and Indian sitar player Shankar, intended to raise funds for refugees of the conflict in East Pakistan during its fight for independence. Held on Aug. 1, 1971, the concert raised close to $250,000 from the 40,000 tickets sold to the event. However, by 1985, the event had sent, via UNICEF, an estimated $12 million to Bangladesh through revenue raised from a live album and film, Concert for Bangladesh.


	One Love Manchester, Ariana Grande‘s all-star benefit concert held for the victims of the May 22, 2017, terror attack after the singer's show at Manchester Arena, raised $12 million when it was held the month following the event. That amount included $3 million (£2.35 million) raised for the British Red Cross and $9 million (£7.3 million) raised for the Manchester Emergency Fund.

The Zac Brown Band starts its limited engagement at the Las Vegas venue Dec. 5.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



	If the immersive, state-of-the-art entertainment venue Sphere didn't already exist, Zac Brown would have had to invent it.


	“I've been wanting to do a spectacle for a couple years,” he tells Billboard. “I've been planning to figure out how to do something where the production and the fan experience is just on [another] level. And then in my planning for doing that, I heard about the Sphere and toured the building while it was under construction. I was like, ‘This is the place…' The Sphere is the greatest canvas that's ever been created for imagination.”


	A little more than two years after Sphere opened in September 2023 with U2, Brown and his Zac Brown Band mates will get their time there with Love & Fear, a four-show limited engagement that coincides with the Dec. 5 release of the band's similarly titled, seventh full-length album. The Sphere dates are Dec. 5-6 and Dec. 12-13. When asked if he anticipates more concerts being added, Brown simply says, “Yes.”

	Last week, the band scrubbed their socials and hinted that a new chapter was coming, posting on Instagram, “There's no way to sum up what the last chapter has meant to us…The next chapter? It's the biggest one yet.”  Then on Monday (July 14), the band posted the dramatic cover of the Love & Fear album, which features what looks like a battle between a mythical angel and devil, with the message, “Two sides of the same truth.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Brown calls the Sphere appearance and the new album “2.0 for our band. There's some bands, they keep going for a while and then they kind of get tired, they stop,” he says. “But my passion and my creativity is as good now as it's ever been, and I just want to keep pushing the envelope of what our band is capable of and bringing our fans along for the ride… This is our chance to show that we're not slowing down. We've actually got our foot on the gas.”

	











	The Grammy-winning band, who has landed five albums on top of Billboard's Country Albums chart, began working on the album two-and-half years ago and then creating the visuals for the Sphere run began 14 months ago. “Every single detail of [the] show is going to be extremely memorable,” Brown says. He promises the performance will (in a good way) “make people's eyes bleed and make them feel every range of the human emotion that we're capable of.”


	The album, which the band is self-releasing, and the show tell the story of Brown's life. “You know, I've never really told the story of my life to anyone that doesn't know me really well,” the Georgia native says, “and so this is a chance to get to do all of those things.”


	The album's first track, “I Ain't Worried About It,” is already out, while a new track, “Let It Run” (feat. Snoop Dogg), will come out Friday (July 18). The album also features Dolly Parton and Marcus King.


	Brown goes so far as to call Love & Fear “one of our masterpieces, and the amount of work we put into that is incredible, from having a 40-piece orchestra [to] having a 20-piece choir.” He says that same detail has gone into the enveloping experience the band has created for Sphere. The symphony's parts for the Sphere show were recorded on the Sphere stage and will be incorporated into the visuals, Brown says.


	Brown, who has seen Phish, Eagles and Anyma at the venue, says the process of planning the show has been all-consuming. “Our challenge for ourselves is to raise the bar. You're only limited to your imagination and your budget,” he says. “It's this massive creative mountain, but I absolutely love it, and I'm obsessed with it. You're kind of building the plane as you're flying it.”

	











	The show will take attendees on a journey, featuring around six songs from the new album with many of the multi-platinum group's hits reimagined in a way that builds a cohesive story, Brown says.


	He says he has no hesitation about revealing so much of himself in the album and show. “I think that's what makes our humanity,” he says. “As an artist, you're naked on a fence anyway and people can either say, ‘That's amazing,' or they can throw rotten vegetables at you. But that's a risk that you have to be willing to take. I'm unapologetically musically going to do the things that I feel like I'm led to do. It's just an expression of my life and my influences and the things that happened. If you don't know who you are, the music industry will chew you up and spit you out the other side. You've got to fight hard for who you are.”


	The band limited its touring to develop the album and show and to encourage fans to come to Sphere—ZBB only has a handful of Australian dates in October between now and the Vegas run. 


	“I'm pulling every favor from every friend that I have on the planet for this album and the Sphere,” he says. “Because of the contract with the Sphere, you can't really go out and tour, so all the money we'd be making touring, we're just kind of betting on ourselves and investing all the money it takes to create it all. I want to step things up, and this is a time for us to do it, and this is the venue we're going to do it in. This is the album that's going to help us to get there.”


	After the Sphere run, Brown, plans to take the Love & Fear show on the road. Though certain elements will only work in the Vegas attraction, the themes will be adapted and carried over to more conventional venues.  

	











	“We're having to build all of our staging and all of our lighting and everything that's going into the Sphere, so we will be able to bring those pieces out on the road,” Brown says. “But the level of detail and amount of time and energy that's gone into creating the video content [for Sphere], it just won't be on as grand of a canvas [on the road.]  I mean, the Sphere is like a modern marvel.”


	Tickets to Love & Fear go on sale to the general public on July 25 at 10 a.m. PT at ZacBrownBand.com. Travel VIP packages, which include a concert ticket and two-night stay at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas are available now at ZacBrownBand.com. All other VIP packages will be on sale July 21 at 10 a.m. PT.

					By Lynette Rice 

Senior TV Writer


	In the midst of celebrating the 13 nominations for The Pitt, Noah Wyle addressed the exit of Tracy Ifeachor.


	The actress who portrayed Dr. Collins in Season 1 announced last week that she would not be returning to the HBO Max drama but said “what a blessing” to participate. She called it an “absolute privilege to play Dr. Heather Collins in such a groundbreaking season and piece.” 


	Wyle acknowledged to Deadline that her departure simply came down to story.


	“I mean, we've all been sort of amused by the speculation about what everybody thinks might be a reason,” the actor continued. “But truthfully, we loved the actress. We enjoyed having her with us very much. She's gotten really big and we will miss her.” 

	











	Collins suffered a miscarriage halfway through the first season and was absent from the final episodes. It was implied early on that she and Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch's (Noah Wyle) were once in a relationship.




			Watch on Deadline		







	On Tuesday, HBO Max's hit The Pitt earned 13 nominations on Tuesday, including nods for Outstanding Drama and Outstanding Actor for Noah Wyle.


	The freshman drama also logged nominations for supporting actress (Katherine LaNasa), guest actor (Shawn Hatosy), directing (John Wells and Amanda Marsalis), writing (Joe Sachs and R. Scott Gemmill), sound editing and casting.


	Production is underway on Season 2 of Max's medical drama The Pitt, which is shot on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, CA with exteriors shot on location in Pittsburgh, PA. Season 2 will premiere in January 2026.

Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor with American Idol, and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found shot to death Monday in their home in the Encino area of Los Angeles, sources have confirmed to  Deadline. 


	Los Angeles police told Deadline that officers were called to the home on White Oak Place at about 2:30 PM Monday on a welfare check after the couple had not been seen for several days. Officers found both with fatal gunshot wounds to the head and they were pronounced dead at the scene.


	No motive has been determined, an LAPD spokesperson said. Detectives from the LAPD's Valley Bureau Homicide Division are investigating the deaths.

TV Reporter


Bella Ramsey received their second Emmy nomination Tuesday morning, making history as the first non-binary performer to earn more than one nom from the Television Academy.


	Ramsey is one of five nominees in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for their performance as Ellie in Season 2 of HBO‘s The Last of Us. They also were nominated for the same role at the 75th Emmy Awards in 2023.


The Last of Us scored 16 nominations for the upcoming 77th Emmy Awards, bringing the series' total to 40 across two seasons. The series won eight golden statuettes in 2024.


	There have been few openly non-binary and transgender performers to be nominated at the Emmy Awards. In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson declined to submit for the acting categories at the Emmys because the categories are separated to recognize male and female actors separately.

	In recent years, gender non-conforming actors have increasingly advocated for the elimination of gendered categories at award shows. However, Ramsey recently defended gendered awards categories, explaining that they felt it was important “recognition for women in the industry is preserved.”


	Based on Naughty Dog's award-winning video game, The Last of Us takes place 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal and heartbreaking journey as they both must traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.

	











	Season 2 picks up five years after the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Whisper Of The Heart left a lo-fi legacy unique to Studio Ghibli","https://www.avclub.com/whisper-of-the-heart-lo-fi-girl-studio-ghibli-legacy","Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

A sea of bokeh lights emanates from Tokyo. Light pollution paints the night sky. The camera pans down into the suburbs. The artificial light becomes less dense, clustered along highways and trainlines. Olivia Newton-John's pop-country fusion recording of “Take Me Home, Country Roads” plays, the gospel-like introduction sung by a choir over organ. Whisper Of The Heart opens unlike any other Studio Ghibli film.

Thirty years since its release, Whisper Of The Heart remains a unique entry in the legendary anime studio's filmography. It was Ghibli's first feature directed by someone other than Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata and, while the studio has made some non-fantastical films, none are so mundane nor romantic. Neither have any cemented a legacy like the one left by its director's single credit. While Miyazaki's influence as the film's writer and storyboarder is apparent, Yoshifumi Kondō's sole directorial effort remains an overlooked but widely influential film. 

Both prescient in its subject matter and a direct predecessor to pervasive animation today, Whisper Of The Heart anticipates a current zeitgeist often summed by vague buzzwords: chill vibes and lo-fi aesthetics, Ghibli-esque romantasy, and low-stakes, character-driven plots (all of which are lumped into the expanding anime category of “slice of life”). Even if you haven't seen moonstruck middle schooler Shizuku Tsukishima fall in love outside of a book for the first time, or follow a cat through the urbanizing expanse of early '90s western Tokyo, you've seen her on YouTube, sitting at a desk overflowing with books, pencil in hand as she writes for hours, lost in the music piped into her wired headphones. Or you've seen this same girl dedicatedly working to improve, sitting at her desk day and night as the seasons change around her, in films like Look Back. Or, as in Sound! Euphonium, you've watched a young girl, overwhelmed by the passion of her first love, burst into tears when she tries to find her own purpose and fails right away. Even Makoto Shinkai‘s densely packed, tactile background art—popular among anime aesthetes on Instagram—would blend seamlessly into the Tsukishima family's small apartment. 

But these images, removed from their context like the Lofi Girl and her “hip hop radio beats to relax/study to,” are just symptoms of a feeling. Whisper Of The Heart offers a prognosis. More than anything else Miyazaki wrote, Whisper Of The Heart is a love story. His most direct adaptation of a source (Aoi Hiiragi's 1989 manga), the film maintains the complex characteristics of his child protagonists and its unmagical world sticks its discordant undertones in its characters' sides like barbs. 

At the library during summer break, Shizuku notices a recurring name in the checkout cards of the many books she's kept her nose in. She forms an ideal of who this “Seiji Amasawa” could be, a romantic image thoroughly shattered by the rude-yet-mysterious boy she finds making violins in an antique shop. Their romance is one of constant refusal of the fairytale stories Shizuku reads at the beginning of the film. Their tropey “school rooftop confession” scene is betrayed by Seiji's news that he's leaving to apprentice at a luthier for two months. If he succeeds, he'll go away again for another 10 years.

Through love, Shizuku finds purpose: writing. She grows from lazily reading all day over summer break to staying up till 3 a.m. writing her novel while Seiji is away. Upon his return, both resolve to push each other towards their goals, even if they part for the foreseeable future. At the same time as he details this love story, Miyazaki works through his feelings on urbanization and the consumer tech boom of the late '80s. This comes courtesy of a subplot told almost entirely visually. While Shizuku writes by hand, her mom, working on her masters thesis, writes at a chunky folding word processor. Empty fields run along highways. Nighttime landscape shots emphasize artificial lighting. The library is replacing the checkout cards with barcodes, foreclosing on the kind of romantic daydreams Shizuku formed through encountering Seiji's name. One could even make a drinking game out of how many times people almost get hit by cars. 

Confessing her disaffection to all this, Shizuku writes a parody of “Country Roads” for her school choir, titled “Concrete Roads.” While the film itself is nostalgic, Shizuku is not. She's wary of the future encroaching on her present. This, more than her likeness, is why Shizuku is the Lofi Girl, her analog ideals resisting a current that will make the world less romantic. The cluttered desks and densely packed bookshelves that always accompany her character design—even when detached from Whisper Of The Heart—are the antithesis of a decade of physical minimalism made possible through maximized digital footprints. 

While all that is communicated nearly wordlessly in the film, it's not easily reducible to an aesthetic. Nor is Ghibli's filmography so reducible as to contain Miyazaki, Takahata, Kondo, and the other directors who have since made films there within a single adjective. At a time when AI image generators attempt to smooth out decades of artistry into a single simplified style, Whisper Of The Heart stands as a resounding refusal of “Ghiblification.”

After Shizuku's finished the marathon of writing her first novel, she has to accept that it isn't very good. She's opened a geode, but the minerals need to be cut and polished. “Now I've written it, I know. Wanting isn't enough. I have to learn more,” she cries after her first failure to extricate something beautiful from within. But Shizuku's first step isn't failing to create, it's succeeding to finally hear the whisper of her heart. Wanting—to be a writer, a luthier, a musician, an animator—isn't enough. But it's a start.

Whisper Of The Heart remains singular in part because Yoshifumi Kondō died three years after it was released in Japan. He wouldn't live to see it come to America; Whisper Of The Heart wouldn't even be released in English until 2006, after the studio's global popularity surged in the wake of Miyazaki's successes in the early '00s. It's become a joke how many times Miyazaki has claimed that he would retire, but his first “final film” was Princess Mononoke, Kondō's last credit as an animation director. Miyazaki had hoped to pass the studio to Kondō, and even held a farewell party after he left Ghibli on January 14, 1998. Kondō died exactly one week later. Two years after Kondō's death, Miyazaki came out of retirement for the first time, to make the film that would become Spirited Away.

Some thief is about to feel the sting of the Beyhive. Last month, two days before Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour kicked off in Atlanta, hard drives containing unreleased Beyoncé music, visuals, setlists, and a pair of AirPods Max were stolen from her choreographer's rental. According to WSB-TV Atlanta, on July 8, the Beyoncé thieves broke into the parking garage where Beyoncé's choreographer, Christopher Grant, and dancer Diandre Blue parked their Jeep Wagoneer. When they returned to the car, someone had broken through the back lift gate and made off with two suitcases containing five hard drives of watermarked and unreleased music, visuals for her stage show, and past and current setlists. The bags also included designer sunglasses, laptops, and a pair of AirPods Max, which gave police a break in the case.

Using Apple's “Find My” feature, police headed to an undisclosed location where the stolen AirPods were pinging. “I conducted a suspicious stop in the area, due to the information that was relayed to me,” the police report states. “There were several cars in the area also that the AirPods were pinging to. After further investigation, a silver (redacted), which had traveled into zone 5 was moving at the same time as the tracking on the AirPods.” Variety reports that an arrest warrant was issued earlier today, but the name of the suspect has not been made public. Either way, sounds like Bey could use a new bodyguard.

First-time Emmy nominee Erin Doherty cooked up a pretty good distraction — literally — when it came to nominations morning. The “Adolescence” star, nominated for Best Limited/Movie Supporting Actress for her work in the smash Netflix hit, was actually making a cake when the nominations rolled in on Tuesday. 

“I was made very aware of [the nominations] and have been made very aware of it, from my girlfriend in particular, she was like, ‘Are you going to watch?' And I was like, ‘No, I'm not!,'” Doherty told IndieWire with a laugh. “I am an anxious person, so I was like, I'll stay away.' I was actually making a cake! And waiting for my agent to call because she said she would.”

When Doherty's agent called? Incredible news: not just her nomination, but 13 overall for the limited series, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series, plus acting noms for co-creator Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper, Ashley Walters, and Christine Tremarco. “I'm so happy for the show, I'm so proud to be a part of it,” a giddy Doherty said over Zoom. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Each episode of the series is designed to look and feel like a single-take, one-hour slice of time. Breakout star Cooper is the driving force of two of those episodes, including the gobsmacking third episode, in which his character Jamie (being held in a youth detention facility before his trial for murdering a classmate) sits down with forensic psychologist Briony Ariston (Doherty) for an unnerving interview. 

While the pair rehearsed for two weeks before shooting, much has been made of the improvisational magic Cooper and Doherty made. They shot two takes a day, five days straight. By the end of it, Cooper told IndieWire previously, he was tired. So he yawned, and Doherty ran with it, asking “Am I boring you?” It was the last take, and the one that made it to air. What does Doherty remember of that? 

“It was so intense and claustrophobic being in that room together, and the whole thing just required us to be present and to bounce off each other,” she said. “So that by the time it ended — and, if you've seen it, [you know] the episode ends in such a climactic release of emotions for me — I left that room and was hugging [series director] Phil [Barantini] and Owen and all our crew, I was just kind of happy to be out of there. I think your body can't distinguish from what is true and what is false. Genuinely, we created such an authentic, horrible environment that I just remember being so grateful to have come to an end.”

 










It was only after filming had ended, Doherty said, did she have the time and space to reflect back on what they had made. “I knew that it was important and vital, but it was only afterwards that I was like, I think we might have made something really special there,” she said.

Watching the show as a fan also offered Doherty continued perspective. “I was kind of in my own little bubble within the realm of the show that I was like, ‘I want to be an audience member of this. … There is no way I'm depriving myself of this opportunity,” she said. “The whole thing was obviously harrowing and disturbing, but I'm so grateful that I got to sit and receive it in that way, because now I get to have those conversations in the world [with other audience members].”

Those conversations run the gamut, she said, from longer chats to quick interactions, the latter of which might be her favorite. 

“What I'm so kind of taken aback by is that a lot of the conversations are just random people on the street, on the tube, being like, ‘Thank you for that show,'” she said. “That is such a gorgeous communication to have with someone, like that's all I'd ever wished to say to people when specific stories have been told that have really hit me. … I think people are just grateful that the conversation is now on the table because it's such a tricky subject matter and one that I think we were all quite afraid of.”

 










She added, “What this show is so great at is, it doesn't actually go, ‘And here are the answers,' because we don't have those answers. We didn't need the answers, we just needed someone to broach the conversation. And I think that's where thank you's come from.”

The series follows in the footsteps in another major Netflix hit from last year: fellow limited series “Baby Reindeer” pulled in 11 nominations in 2024, walking away with six, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. What is it about Netflix that makes it such a perfect home for these heartbreaking, harrowing, ripped-from-real-life stories? 

“It's gotta be the bravery to just, trust in audiences, in their intelligence, in their want to and desire to to be given these really raw human stories,” the actress said. “I think we're ready for it. We always have been, but there's always going to be that dynamic with TV and film of like, ‘It it going to put bums in seats? Is it gonna sell? It's all about, will people watch this thing and, I think this show proves that we want these really authentic stories. We have a hunger for it.”

That's, Doherty thinks, why shows like “Adolescence” and “Baby Reindeer” truly succeed. 

“That's why it absolutely hit the stratosphere in a way that no one was anticipating, because there's such courage behind there,” Doherty said, “I'm so grateful for Netflix for having the ability to just [let] … Jack and Stephen write this story in as true a way as you can, and that's it. There's such integrity within storytelling, it clearly has an impact. … Sometimes you just have to have faith, like, in the truth and the purity of something. That, for me, is what good art does.”

 










Wait, what kind of cake? Doherty laughed. “It's actually a fridge cake, because it's really hot at the minute,” she said. “I've never made it before, and it's actually my birthday tomorrow. So I'm making my own birthday cake, which I'm chuffed about, because I really wanted to make it!”

Talk about a great birthday.

All episodes of “Adolescence” are now streaming on Netflix. The 77th Annual Emmy Awards will air September 14 on CBS.

	Alan Sepinwall



	When we talk about snubs and surprises with this year's Emmy nominations, we're at times stretching each term. Some of the “snubs” mentioned below involve shows or performances that weren't necessarily the best, but fit the pattern of the kinds of things that usually get nominated, while others were great but were expected to be ignored. And some of the surprises are more about matters of degree, rather than their presence at all. Let's get to it.  


SURPRISE: The Studio dominatesIt was a great morning to be an Apple TV+ executive. Severance was the year's most-nominated show, with 27, as everyone in the cast other than Christopher Walken got nominated. Meanwhile, the Seth Rogen comedy The Studio set a new Emmy record for the most nominations for a first-year comedy, with 23. It helped that Hollywood awards voters are susceptible to shows about their own industry (especially when they're good), and that they're particularly susceptible to celebrities who play themselves. Six of the show's nominations were in the guest actor or actress category, for people like Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, and Zoë Kravitz. (Alas, actress turned director turned actress Sarah Polley wasn't one of those six.) 

	











SURPRISE: Voters didn't punish The Bear Season ThreeThe 2024 Emmy telecast ended on a shocking note, as the second season of The Bear — one of the most acclaimed seasons of television in recent memory — lost the Outstanding Comedy Series trophy to Hacks. At the time, it was unclear whether this was the voters punishing the series for category fraud, since it's increasingly hard to justify calling this intense and poignant show a comedy, or if Academy members were annoyed by the more uneven third season, which was released during the voting window for Season Two. If it was the latter, they certainly forgot their animus a year later, since the show landed 13 nominations, including a return visit to Outstanding Comedy Series.

SNUB: What We Do in the Shadows castThe FX vampire comedy had a decent showing for its final season, with six nominations, including for Outstanding Comedy Series and for the writing of the series finale. But a show with some of the funniest performances of this century will end its run with a grand total of one acting nomination, a 2024 nod for Matthew Berry, who went back to being snubbed like all his hilarious co-stars this year.  


SURPRISE/SNUB: Katherine LaNasa and Shawn Hatosy for The Pitt / Taylor Dearden for The PittEveryone expected the critically-adored hospital drama The Pitt to have a big nomination total, and it did with 13 — what would be a huge haul for a rookie show in a year not featuring a series like The Studio. But because Noah Wyle is by far the most famous member of the cast, there was a question of whether he would be the only actor nominated. Instead, Wyle was joined by supporting actress LaNasa (as wise head nurse Dana Evans) and guest star Hatosy (as night shift doctor Jack Abbott). Both are hugely deserving. But if the Emmy voters weren't so fixated on nominating every possible actor from The White Lotus (more on that below), they might have had room for Taylor Dearden, whose performance as anxious resident Mel King made her the year's most endearing new character.   


SURPRISE: Harrison Ford for ShrinkingFord's alternately funny and tragic work as an aging psychiatrist with Parkinson's was among the biggest snubs of the 2023 Emmy nominations, so it's a relief to find him on the list this year for his continually terrific work in the second Shrinking season. His co-star Michael Urie joined returnees Jason Segel and Jessica Williams. A good showing all around, as part of Apple's overall huge day.  


SNUB: Zahn McClarnon for Dark WindsAt this point, it shouldn't be surprising that McClarnon keeps being ignored for his towering dramatic work as Navajo cop Joe Leaphorn on the AMC period crime drama. This is the third straight season without a nomination for him. Nonetheless, we'll keep screaming about it, in the hopes that one day he might squeak in the way that Kyle Chandler eventually did for Friday Night Lights, Matthew Rhys for The Americans, and a few other Emmy cases of better late than never.

SURPRISE: Jeff Hiller for Somebody SomewhereSomebody Somewhere, HBO's lovely, intimate comedy about life in a small Kansas town, was so small in both scope and audience that perhaps the biggest shock of the day is that it got two nominations for its third and final season: one for writing, and one for Hiller's ingratiating, moving supporting performance as the best friend of Bridget Everett's character. (And while Everett was snubbed for her own acting work, she shared the writing nom with Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen.) 

	











SNUB: A Man on the Inside Once the rom-com Nobody Wants This got three big nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series and stars Kristen Bell and Adam Brody, there was no room left at the inn for another Netflix rookie, the wise and warm senior citizen comic mystery A Man on the Inside, nor even for its star, Ted Danson. Danson has 18 previous nominations and two wins, and while he's not always a lock to be recognized by his peers (no noms for shows like Becker, Bored to Death, or his stint on CSI), voters loved his previous collaboration with Man creator Michael Schur, The Good Place. 


SURPRISE: Owen Cooper for AdolescenceThat Cooper was nominated is in one way no surprise, since he was astonishingly great in his debut performance as the underaged killer at the heart of the single-take Netflix miniseries. And if you're someone who pays close attention to which actors submit themselves in which categories, his presence in the supporting actor ranks is also not surprising. But it nonetheless feels like category fraud, and a way to potentially get wins for both Cooper and his co-star Stephen Graham, who was nominated as a lead actor. Because there are only four episodes, and no one from the cast is in all four, it's hard to argue that there is a single lead of Adolescence. But Cooper was absolutely a lead of the show, dominating the two episodes in which he appeared in both screen time and presence.  


SNUB: My Brilliant FriendThere are famous cases of classic shows never winning an Emmy, like The Wire, Parks and Recreation, and, most recently, Better Call Saul. But those shows usually got nominated, whether it was only a few (two for The Wire) or a lot (a whopping 53 for Saul). It's incredibly rare for a series to run multiple seasons with intense critical acclaim and never get a single nomination. We can unfortunately add HBO's Italian-language adaptation of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels to a list that also includes Rectify, Review, and Terriers. An incredible show that went wholly ignored, even though Emmy voters have been kinder to foreign language shows in recent years (see the dominance of Shōgun at the 2024 ceremony). 


SURPRISE: Sam Rockwell for The White LotusRockwell's monologue about his character's obsession with Thai ladyboys was easily the highlight of the bumpy fifth Lotus season. So in that respect, his nomination makes total sense, especially since the voters seem determined to nominate as many actors from that show as possible each year. The surprise comes down to him being in the supporting actor group rather than guest actor, though that turns out to be a quirk of Emmy math. Because he was in half of the season's episodes — even if only briefly in some — he's ineligible for the guest categories. (See also Pedro Pascal, who edged over the guest/lead actor eligibility line with a brief appearance at the very end of the fifth episode of this season of The Last of Us.)

	











SNUB: Past Emmy favoritesThe easiest way to win an Emmy is usually to have already won an Emmy, just as the easiest way to get nominated is to be a past nominee. That trick doesn't always work, though. The final  season of The Handmaid's Tale — a show with 15 Emmy wins, including Outstanding Drama Series for its first year — only got a guest acting nod for Cherry Jones. Yellowjackets, which got 10 nominations in its first two seasons — including drama series nods both times — was shut out for its third. Squid Game Season Two was also ignored, after getting 14 nominations and six wins for its first season. And Natasha Lyonne, who has five prior Emmy nominations, couldn't get her second nod in a row for Poker Face, whose second season (at least, the half of it that debuted during this year's eligibility window) only got nominations for guest star Cynthia Erivo and stunt work. 


SNUB: The RehearsalThe second season of the Nathan Fielder docu-comedy didn't go home empty-handed, with two directing and one writing nomination. After the first season went unnominated, that's a significant step up. That said, the nomination total feels light for a show that was so talked about this spring.

SNUB: Industry[We close the list by welcoming Rolling Stone writer CT Jones to pen this particular objection.]


	The war between millennials and Gen Z continues apace. HBO's enfant-terrible drama Industry was completely left out of the lead and supporting actor categories, a puzzling oversight a drama that's slowly built to a passionate cult following. Season Three saw actors Marisa Abela, Ken Leung, Myha'la, Sagar Radia, and even new cast member Kit Harrington leave the trading room floor behind for a whirlwind mélange of country clubs, man-child tech founders, green energy IPOs, and gambling. And while the stakes continued to rise, co-showrunners Mickey Down and Konrad Kay coaxed generational performances from each star actor in their solo episodes. Why don't Emmy voters want to see young, hot women succeed in business and possibly murder? It's just not fair.

							By 

	Jonathan Bernstein



	After a long couple of years, Amanda Shires is ready to reemerge. Her grandmother and, more recently, her father, died. There have been moments of crying at the gym (“like the Taylor Swift song,” Shires says), and moments of feeling so numb she could no longer feel her body. 


	There's also, of course, her divorce from singer-songwriter Jason Isbell, which was initiated in late 2023 and finalized earlier this year. The divorce, after 10 years of marriage, and the ensuing emotional fallout and period of personal growth and regrowth following it, is the subject of Shires' new album, Nobody's Girl, out Sept. 26.


	But before she shares the album with the world, Shires wants to talk a bit about the period that led to this record. “The past two years of my life have made it to where I feel like I can talk about anything, at this point,” she says. “I have always used music as a way to explain what's going on in my life to myself. And it was a big transition to go from, you know, having been in a marriage for a long time and to suddenly find that I'm not. It takes a lot of learning and self-reflection and, for me, a lot of time to process. In the processing, the music came about, and most all of that was a really hard, bad time. There were some moments of joy, as there tends to be, but we never focus on those.”

	











	Shires recorded Nobody's Girl in Nashville and Los Angeles, where she took trips for emotionally wrenching sessions with her collaborator Lawrence Rothman. “I didn't want to put any of my friends in the middle of any of the fallout,” says Shires. “So, I went to L.A. and had a few friends come play on some sensitive material, friends who could put up with a woman crying on occasion, either out of joy or want for tacos or sadness.”

	











	She wrote around 30 songs for the record, and some of the earliest ones were so raw, bitter and detailed in their excavation of emotions toward her ex-husband, that, as Shires puts it, “they ought to be for me and Jesus.”

	But the songs that did make the record, after much back and forth, are still brutally honest and forthcoming, about both Shires' marriage and the emotional sea-change in her life that its fallout kickstarted. There are songs about new flirtations and about global devastation, but mostly there are songs about unbearable heartbreak, regrowth, and survival. It is a record, as the album's lead single, “A Way It Goes,” (out today) puts it, that is as much about the picking up of the pieces after her life-changing divorce as it is about the events that preceded that split.


	Though there are a couple songs that get brutally detailed about the split (including one called, yes, “The Details”), Nobody's Girl is also an exercise in narrative restraint and an album that says more by saying very little. “Don't ask about the deep end,” as Shires sings in “A Way It Goes.” 


	Nearly everything has changed in Shires' life, and she's still getting used to much of it. “Even the feeling of not wearing your wedding ring is really strange,” she says. “You're like, ‘At my age, wow, when all these people see my hand empty, what are they thinking of me?' I don't know! And why do I care?”


	Calling from her home in Tennessee, Shires recently spoke with Rolling Stone about her upcoming album, “A Way It Goes,” and what she's learned about herself after one of the hardest periods of her life.


What was the spark for “A Way It Goes”?It was everybody asking me what happened. Not everybody was just trying to get gossip: Some people genuinely cared and they want to know how you're doing. I can't tell if I'm trying to protect other people or myself, because you are responsible, in a way, or I feel responsible, if I dark somebody out too much, so I didn't want to do that. Because there are feelings and there are things I said and did and probably shouldn't have done — there's the yelling and mad stage of whatever grief, anger, and bitterness is — so sometimes I did want to say all those things but I also know, at my core, I'm not that person. And I didn't want to say that it wasn't fucking hard, because it was, but my preference would be for you to see me back when I'm a whole person again. So, the whole start of that song were those questions. You feel a little bit like something in an aquarium people want to look at.

The MFA graduate in you must've felt proud when you came up with the phrase “leviathan of lonely.”Oh, that was the exact feeling. My fear was, “Oh no, no one's going to know what it means.” And then I was like, “Fuck it, I do, and it feels exactly like that.”


Where were you when you wrote the song?I went to Los Angeles and sat with Lawrence, and the first thing we started working on was that bed for “A Way It Goes.” It just started coming out and I wasn't expecting that because it has a hopefulness to it. I didn't want to write any more songs at that point, but Lawrence said I still had a ways to go. I just went ahead and said “Okay” because I wasn't in the best place in my life for decision making. There is a beautiful thing that Lawrence Rothman does as a friend, where they can see a person is struggling and knows that the way they get through these things is with their art. The songs that came from the [L.A. session with Rothman], we needed them for the record, but in the moment I didn't realize that I needed them. The point was to finish working through the thoughts or psyche or place that I was in as a way to get me out of it. Like, “Come over here and drown with me in my studio, and I'll make sure you're still living when you get out.”


Were you listening to other classic divorce records while making Nobody's Girl?I wasn't studying other records for the purpose of making this one. There's a few things that got me through this stuff. That Jack White No Name album, I put that on repeat as loud as I could everywhere I went. I mean, on repeat enough to annoy the birds. And I listened to D'Angelo and the Vanguard's [Black Messiah] over and over and over. Musically, it felt relaxing. 


	But I did have a pretty upfront conversation with Shooter Jennings because I was trying to take all the songs off the record that had anything to do with the breakup and that period of my life, because I didn't want people to know that stuff, at first. It feels a little navel gaze-y. And Shooter was like, “You can't just not put these songs on the record. That doesn't make sense.” He was like, “Just call me your ‘divorce consultant' for the record.” That was also probably during the time where I wasn't in a good place to make good decisions about my work. It's good to have friends for that, too. Me and Lawrence were arguing about this, so that's how the Shooter conversation happened. Shooter is a good friend of mine from way back, and he was the tiebreaker without knowing it. 

	











Speaking of other records, did you ever listen to Foxes in the Snow?I put that record on. I appreciate the musicianship. 


In the bio you wrote for the album, you write that the record is about you reclaiming your story. In recent years, had it felt like the Amanda Shires story was one you no longer had control over?Well, I have a tendency in a relationship to give and give and give and give, because that's the way, I guess, I show love. It's not people pleasing; It genuinely makes me happy to give and help. But I also understand how the world works and how you can build a life and career as a woman in the music business and still not have anything to show for it, whether it's the pay gap or being marketable or packageable, or whatever age you are. There's no harm in putting eggs in a couple of baskets, and for the joy of a life you're building, build something great with another person, you know? As far as the story goes, for a woman, you are identified as some kind of role you play: “She's a mom”; “She's a sister”; “She's a divorcée.” 


	But the story of Amanda Shires, all that, any kind of career envy or jealousy never was a thing. I've been working since I was 15 for major legacy acts, and the Highwomen. I love the 400 Unit and everything, and anyway, there was never any of that. I'm not a dummy. But as far as the story, I don't really know how it reads from the outside. On the inside I don't feel like I lost control of it, I just felt like, in living it, in hindsight, I applied more of my own force and care into other projects. I would do that for myself, too, but obviously I would put myself last. But when you're just your own self standing around, there's nobody else to put first. 


It sounds like you're saying it could sometimes feel like your story was near the bottom of the pile of other stories you felt like you had to give yourself to?Rightly or wrongly, I don't know. But I chose [that], and I live with the consequences.

You've written about trust and discord and breakdowns in communication in relationships for a long time. I'm thinking of songs like “If I” and “Harmless.” Did you feel connected to your past work when writing about this turbulent period in your life?It felt like, I'm writing about me and the things that draw up this call to put abstractions in a more visual way. It's taking love, grief, loss, all those big words, and trying to show pictures of that. What is actually outside the name of the feeling? What does that look like? “If I” is just plain and simple. “Harmless” is very detailed, the details that happened on a very plain kind of evening. For this, I was blending together saying something plainly and then not fussing with every detail. This is going to sound silly, but I try to write things that are interesting to me and that I haven't heard before and are actually real things in the moment: “A phased golden light/Rained down from the streetlight” — That's just showing how the light falls on a person. I like to do that kind of thing. I feel like, on this record, I mixed the super detailed thing with the plain, simpler emotion together. Like in “A Way It Goes,” the chorus is so simple, but in some of the verses, there is that kind of imagery. I think that's what I did on this one better than I've done before.

	











You sing about it quite eloquently on the new album, but what do you feel like you've learned about yourself throughout the making of this record?I can actively name the feeling of anxiety when I feel it in my body, which I've never experienced so much of in my life. I guess I learned that it's all manageable, even when you feel like it's not. Also, even if you think things couldn't possibly get worse, they definitely can. And I learned, no matter what happens in my future going forward, there's no place in my life I can imagine not keeping my friends close to me. Nobody ever thinks anything's going to end, and also nobody really expects people to take sides, but they do. I learned that I have to keep on putting myself first. And I learned that you can exist for six months on a diet of double stuffed Golden Oreos and rosé champagne. What else did I learn? I've learned that I can face armadillos on my own in the yard. All kinds of things.

							By 

	Andy Greene



The long, pathetic, sordid, criminal saga of Billy McFarland and the Fyre Festival came to an ignominious end Tuesday afternoon at precisely 12:44:11 pm EST when the convicted fraudster unloaded the brand and all trademarks related to the ill-fated musical festival on eBay for $245,300.


	McFarland still owes $26 million in restitution related to his wire fraud conviction, so he's going to have to keep scrounging around to raise the remaining $25,754,700.


	For those of you with no memory of 2017 and somehow missed Hulu's Fyre Fraud and Netflix's Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, the Fyre Festival was advertised as a luxury musical festival on an island in the Bahamas with lineup that included Blink-182, Pusha T, Tyga, Desiigner, Major Lazer, Disclosure, and Migos.


	But when fans arrived at the festival site, they were greeted with little more than dinky tents, grounds that resembled a refugee camp, and cheese sandwiches. It turned out that McFarland and his investors, including rapper Ja Rule, didn't have the money, means, or experience to stage the event. A wave of lawsuits followed, and McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison.

	











	McFarland was released in 2022 and immediately started to plan a second Fyre Festival. “We have the chance to embrace this storm and really steer our ship into all the chaos that has happened,” he told NBC. “And if it's done well, I think Fyre has a chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry.”

	Unsurprisingly, McFarland had absolutely no ability to deliver on that promise. This time around, however, the plug was pulled long before any guests arrived. In the aftermath, he decided to cut his losses and forever part ways with the brand.

A post shared by FYRE FESTIVAL (@fyrefestival)


	“This brand is bigger than any one person,” Mr. McFarland said in a statement on Instagram. “It's clear that I need to step back and allow a new team to move forward independently.”

	It's unclear who bought it, but they now own the Fyre Festival brand name, the social media accounts, “comprehensive marketing assets,” the domain names, “artist & talent relationships,” an “extensive media coverage archive,” and “access to the core team (optional).”


	This poses a few questions. First off, how exactly can “artist and talent relationships” be sold? And weren't those relationships forever poisoned by the historic debacles of the past? It's hard to imagine that Blink-182's team sees this as a solid relationship. They won't exactly be like, “A random person bought the Fyre Festival. We're obligated by the terms of an Ebay listing to work with them on their next endeavor, even though we were humiliated and stiffed out of money eight years ago by the original team.”


	Secondly, it's nice to see that access to McFarland and Ja Rule is optional, but is that really a selling point? They haven't proven themselves very adept at putting on this particular festival. Someone is going to give them a third attempt with their own money on the line?

	Finally, what exactly is this media archive? Is it linked to online articles documenting the collapse of the festival, the lawsuits that followed, and the pathetic attempt to stage a second one? Did they make a scrapbook of the print articles? These are assets?


	As we await answers, it's good to know that the Fyre Festival dream isn't dead. It's now in the hands of somebody else with $245,300 to spare. We look forward to seeing what they do with it.

President Donald Trump has implored people to stop talking about Jeffrey Epstein. The internet isn't listening. 

Trump and many in his administration are now facing the wrath of the more conspiracy theory-minded people whom they counted among their most ardent supporters, sparked by the Department of Justice and Trump's own pleas for people to stop asking questions about Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose name has become synonymous with a broader distrust of the government and the media. 

“One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it's the 'HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World,” Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social. “Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

If anything, Trump's post only further invigorated discussion. Data from Google showed that searches for Epstein spiked after Trump's post. The fallout, which started in early June and ramped up over the weekend, has even hit some of Trump's most loyal spaces. Trump's Truth Social post has received more than 45,000 responses, far more than other recent posts, with many of the top comments expressing frustration with the president.

“This statement breaks my heart, Mr. President,” one commenter wrote.

“We want the ELITE PEDOS exposed!” another wrote. 

Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide, but conspiracy theories claiming that “Epstein didn't kill himself” began to spread almost immediately in the aftermath.

Trump has used conspiracy theories for political gain since before he ran for president, when he stoked false claims that Barack Obama's birth certificate was fake. Since then, he and his supporters have embraced or at least entertained a wide variety of outlandish claims, with many centering on child abuse. During his most recent presidential campaign, Trump said he would have “no problem” looking into an Epstein client list — a list that some people believe exists and that contains the names of powerful clients of Epstein's. 

Trump further leaned into the conspiracy mindset, appointing to senior positions people who have similarly used conspiracy theories to make broad accusations of corruption and abuse, most notably FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino.

“Nobody exploited those questions more than Donald Trump,” said Russell Muirhead, a professor at Dartmouth College who has written on the online intersection of conspiracy theories and politics. “And he did that because, as always, he wanted to paint government officials as liars, as self-serving, as liberal ideologues, as people who just deserve to be fired. Well, now government officials are people he appointed, and now he's saying, ‘Hey, there's nothing to see here.'”

Suspicions about the treatment of the Epstein case and his death have festered online across the political spectrum for years. The phrase “Epstein didn't kill himself,” a rebuttal to the official explanation of Epstein's death, has taken on a cultural meaning beyond the facts of the case, popping up in recent years everywhere from holiday decorations and stickers to internet memes.

Joseph Uscinski, a political science professor at the University of Miami who has written extensively on conspiracy theories, stressed that claims of shadowy groups of elites abusing children have been around for millennia, with the Epstein theories only a more recent and high-profile example.

“These ideas have been there,” he said. “We just weren't paying attention.”

Public interest in all things Epstein has remained high since last week, when Axios first reported that a two-page memo from the Justice Department featured a conclusion that an “exhaustive review” of materials related to Epstein found no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list'” or evidence for prosecuting other people connected to him. It also confirmed that Epstein had died by suicide. 

The memo inspired a large amount of backlash from Trump's supporters, which led to exhortations from Trump supporting Attorney General Pam Bondi and questioning the continued interest in Epstein — backlash that was only further exacerbated by Trump's Truth Social post.

Together, the combination has led to a sustained viral commotion over the last week that has been nearly inescapable online, from Reddit and YouTube to X and even Trump's own Truth Social.

Some of that unrest made its way offline. 

Over the weekend, at the conservative Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit, discussion of Epstein was unavoidable. Clips from that event, with people openly questioning the administration's credibility, also spread across social media. In a live taping of Steve Bannon's War Room podcast at the conference, one attendee told Trump's former campaign CEO and senior counselor that he believed “now Trump has become the deep state,” saying, “What is more deep state than covering up for pedophiles?”

There's not much the White House can do to quell the response. On Instagram, the White House restricted the ability to comment with GIFs on its official account and the @POTUS account, after users kept posting GIFs depicting Trump and Epstein together. 

Uscinski noted that Trump and officials in his administration did not do themselves any favors by fanning the flames around Epstein, particularly around Epstein's death, only to now be told to stop talking about it. But he added that Epstein theories broke beyond partisan lines in ways other conspiracy theories haven't.

“Their audience was listening to them, because they were telling them what they already believed,” Uscinski said of Trump administration officials. “Now that they're telling them something different, they don't want to go along with it.”

In a press gaggle on Thursday, President Donald Trump hailed the Big Beautiful Bill's passing both houses of Congress and referred to it as an economic ""rocket ship.""

FIRST ON FOX: The White House rolled out an interactive map of the U.S. showing the savings Americans can expect from initiatives under President Donald Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act on a state-by-state basis, Fox News Digital learned Tuesday. 

Trump signed the massive piece of legislation into law on the Fourth of July, touting that its tax cuts will make the U.S. economy similar to a ""rocket ship"" as Americans begin feeling its effects. 

On Tuesday, the White House published an interactive map of the 50 states that provides breakdowns of how much Americans can expect to save and see in their pocketbooks compared to if the bill had not been passed and signed into law. 

The interactive map focused on data such as: real wage increases, which are understood as the increase to a worker's income after accounting for inflation; a family's expected real take-home pay increase; how many seniors benefit from the no tax on Social Security; the percentage of a state's labor force who are expected to benefit from not paying taxes on tips; the number of jobs protected in a state, and other data.

In California, the nation's most populated state, residents can expect a real wage increase of $4,900 to $8,800 and a real take-home pay increase of $8,500 to $12,500 for a typical family with two kids, according to the map. 

""A typical family with two children in California can expect to see higher take-home pay of about $8500 to $12500 with OBBB compared to if it was not passed,"" states the map, which includes links to more detailed data on any given state. ""Around 4% of the labor force is employed in occupations that would likely benefit from the no taxes on tips provision of the OBBB. Around 6.0 million seniors in California could benefit from the no taxes on Social Security provision of the OBBB.""

STEVE MOORE: TRUMP JUST SCORED THE BIGGEST CONSERVATIVE VICTORY IN THREE DECADES

Residents in a Heartland State such as Nebraska can expect a real wage increase of $3,700 to $6,600 and a real take-home pay increase for a typical family with two children of $7,300 to $10,300. The map also touts 300,000 seniors in the Cornhusker State are expected to benefit from the lack of tax on Social Security, and an expected 29% of the state's labor force is expected to benefit from the lack of tax on overtime pay. 

On the East Coast, residents of New Jersey can expect real wage increases of $5,000 to $9,000, and a real take-home pay increase of $8,600 to $12,700 for typical families with two children, according to the data reviewed by Fox News Digital. New Yorkers can expect a $4,400 to $8,000 real wage increase, and a real take-home pay increase of $8,000 to $11,700, data show.

Trump had been rallying Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation since the early days of his administration this year, as it advances his agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt.

House and Senate Republicans delivered the legislation to Trump's desk in July after a hard-fought battle that included a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in their condemnation of the bill, mostly over its increase to the debt limit. 

A handful of Republicans, such as Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against their chamber's respective versions of the bill due to its $5 trillion increase to the debt limit. Former Trump ally Elon Musk also broke with the president over the bill, calling on lawmakers to ""kill the bill"" as it made its way through Congress due to its increase to the U.S. debt ceiling. 

The bill ultimately passed and includes key provisions to permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporates new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay. It also rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump's mass deportation efforts, and institutes Medicaid reforms. 

WHITE HOUSE HANDS AMERICANS 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' CALCULATOR TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH THEY'D SAVE UNDER ACT

""We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,"" Trump said during the signing ceremony. ""That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country.… After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.… It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families.… The Golden Age of America is upon us.""

NEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised the bill in an opinion piece published on Fox News Digital earlier in July, celebrating that Americans can expect to keep ""an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hailed the passage of the ""big, beautiful bill"" for the prosperity it will bring to the U.S. (Pool)

""The bill prevents a $4.5 trillion tax hike on the American people,"" he wrote in an op-ed published July 4. ""This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay. Add to this the president's ambitious deregulation agenda, which could save the average family of four an additional $10,000. For millions of Americans, these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college.""

""The One Big Beautiful Bill also codifies no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay — both policies designed to provide financial relief to America's working class,"" he added. ""These tax breaks will ensure Main Street workers keep more of their hard-earned income. And they will bolster productivity by rewarding Americans who work extra hours. All Americans can learn how President Trump's tax cuts will impact their lives for the better with a new White House calculator.""

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin fell below the $117,000 level on Tuesday after cryptocurrency-related bills were blocked in the House of Representatives.

The price of bitcoin was last down 2.8% at $116,516.00, according to Coin Metrics. That marks a pullback from the day's high of $120,481.86.

The drop comes on the heels of multiple crypto-related bills failing to overcome a procedural hurdle in the House, with 13 Republicans voting with Democrats to block the motion in a 196-223 vote.

In recent days, bitcoin has been trading at all-time highs, spurred by institutional buying of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid rising optimism that Congress would soon pass crypto legislation.

Stocks linked to crypto also came under pressure in late afternoon trading. Shares of bitcoin miners Riot Platforms and Mara Holdings closed down 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Others like crypto trading platforms Coinbase slid 1.5%. All were under pressure in extended trading.

In this article

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday said the Trump administration reversed course on allowing Nvidia to sell its AI chips to China because the U.S. company will not be giving over its best technology.

Lutnick made the remark speaking with CNBC's Brian Sullivan, saying that Nvidia wants to sell China its ""fourth best"" chip, which is slower than the fastest chips that U.S. companies use.

""We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best,"" Lutnick said.

Nvidia said Monday night that it would soon resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration signaled that it would grant the chipmaker necessary export licenses.

Lutnick said that the administration said that the renewed sale of H20 chips to China was linked to a rare earths magnet deal. He said it was in U.S. interests to have Chinese companies using American technology so they continue to use an American ""tech stack.""

""The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it,"" Lutnick said. ""We want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology stack, because they still rely upon it.""

Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said in recent weeks that the U.S. should continue selling his chips to China so Chinese companies don't invest in homegrown infrastructure. Huang on Sunday also said that the Chinese military wouldn't use Nvidia chips anyway, and previously signaled that China's Huawei is a legitimate competitor.

""The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own,"" Lutnick said. ""You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips.""

The reversal is a major win for Nvidia. Huang had previously said the Trump administration's decision to require a license for the H20 chip in April ""effectively closed"" the China market. Nvidia said it could have sold $8 billion in H20 chips in the current quarter before sales were stopped.

The administration reversed its decision after President Donald Trump met with Huang in Washington last week.

""You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack,"" Lutnick said. ""That's the thinking.""

The H20 chip was introduced in 2022 in response to Biden administration export controls. It's based on the same underlying technology as Nvidia's Hopper-generation chips, which are sold in the U.S. as finished systems using H100 or H200 chips.

The U.S. chipmaker took some features out of the H20 in order to sell it to China, including fewer graphics processing unit cores and lower bandwidth connecting separate parts of the chip. But the success of the DeepSeek R1 model suggested that there were many Chinese companies that were just fine with the slowed-down chips. The China-specific H20 is behind Nvidia's Blackwell chips, the H100 and the H200, Lutnick said.

Nvidia says that it releases new artificial intelligence chips every year and that serious AI developers should always try to get the latest and greatest versions because the technology is improving so quickly.

The best AI chips broadly available from clouds and system makers today are called Blackwell, and come as a GB200 chip with a paired central processing unit as well as B100 and B200 versions. Nvidia also makes a range of Blackwell-based chips for gaming and graphics that can be used for AI, but they're generally weaker than the biggest chips designed for data centers.

A successor, called Blackwell Ultra, is only now starting to be installed in data centers, and it's expected to ramp in volume over the next year. In 2027, Nvidia will release ""Vera Rubin"" chips.

 Republicans are still planning to pass three pieces of crypto-related legislation, but a majority of members in the House voted against a resolution to consider the bills. 

Cryptocurrency-related bills backed by US President Donald Trump failed to clear a key procedural step in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, despite the president's public push for action. 

Trump had urged Republican lawmakers to “get the first vote done this afternoon” on legislation to regulate payment stablecoins as part of a larger effort to pass crypto legislation before the August recess.

In a Tuesday post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump ordered all Republicans to vote yes on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate payment stablecoins in the US. 

The legislation is one of three bills, along with ones to address market structure and central bank digital currencies, that Republican House leaders had been pushing as part of the party's “crypto week” plans.

The president may have been referring to a House resolution to consider the three bills and a defense bill, which failed to get support from a majority of lawmakers present on Tuesday — at least 13 Republicans may have voted against the resolution. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly said the chamber would take up another vote “this afternoon.”

The GENIUS Act, which passed through the Senate in June with bipartisan support despite initial resistance from many Democrats, is expected to head for a floor vote in the House by Thursday. At the time of publication, the bill was scheduled to be considered by the House sometime this week, but it was unclear whether the chamber planned a separate floor vote on Tuesday.

Trump has personally come under scrutiny for his role in pushing the stablecoin legislation due to his involvement in his family-backed crypto company World Liberty Financial (WLF), which issued its own stablecoin and suggested a conflict of interest. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Binance helped create WLF's USD1 stablecoin, also used by an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm to settle a $2 billion investment into the crypto exchange. 

“World Liberty Financial has received a significant portion of its funding from overseas, which has brought about serious ethical and national security concerns,” said California Representative Maxine Waters' office on Tuesday, adding: “[F]oreign investment is not just a business deal, it's a direct payment to the sitting US president with the goal of currying favor and influence within the White House.”

Many Democratic leaders have responded to Republicans' push for the digital assets bills with their own “anti-crypto corruption week” agenda. They are calling for amendments in the three bills to address consumer protection and prevent the president, vice president, and members of Congress from holding or promoting crypto over concerns with conflicts of interest.

About this rating 



Trump added that FIFA had gifted him the original trophy. It's unclear, however, where the trophy is located as of this writing.

As the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup concluded in the U.S., a rumor spread that President Donald Trump said he had kept the original trophy, leaving the winning club, Chelsea F.C. from England, to lift a copy. The Club World Cup is an international tournament in which soccer clubs from around the world compete, as opposed to national teams that compete in the World Cup itself.

This post appeared on X: 



Another X post (archived) that relayed the claim and called Trump's keeping the original trophy ""pathetic"" had amassed 867,500 views as of this writing, and 14,000 likes. The claim further spread on X, but also on Reddit and TikTok. Further, Snopes readers searched the website seeking to verify the veracity of the claim.

In addition, several news reports made the same claim, including The Guardian and The Independent, both U.K.-based news outlets.

The rumor stemmed from comments Trump made in a video interview with the British sports streaming platform DAZN. Because the president himself gave this information, we were able to determine he had indeed said he'd kept the original trophy.

DAZN published a clip of the interview on YouTube on July 14, 2025, the day after the tournament's final. However, it was clear from the exchange that it had been recorded as the final was taking place on July 13, 2025: 



During the interview, the reporter said the trophy was now at Trump Tower. Trump responded, saying FIFA had gifted him the trophy:

They said, ""Could you hold this trophy for a little while?"" We put it in the Oval Office and then I said, ""When are you going to pick up the trophy?"" He said, ""We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one."" And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting.

Trump did not confirm whether he had moved the trophy to Trump Tower. We have contacted the White House to inquire about the current whereabouts of the trophy and what plans, if any, Trump has for it. We have also contacted FIFA asking whether they had indeed gifted the trophy to Trump. We will update this report should they respond.
