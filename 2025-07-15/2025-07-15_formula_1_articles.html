                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Pitt's full onboard lap in Lando Norris' McLaren MCL60 Amid continued speculation over Max Verstappen's future, Jenson Button has given his take on how a switch to Mercedes could play out for the Dutchman – and what the situation could hold for George Russell. Jenson Button has admitted that he would “love” to see Max Verstappen and George Russell become team mates at Mercedes amid continued speculation about the Dutchman's future, though the 2009 World Champion also suggested that changing teams could be “tricky” for Verstappen. Talk surrounding a possible move to the Silver Arrows for Verstappen grew in Austria when Russell – whose current deal runs until the end of 2025 – told Sky Sports F1 that it was "only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing". Facing questions about the situation one week later at the British Grand Prix, Verstappen remained tight-lipped as he stated: "I have nothing to add. Other people write stuff, that's great but it's not for me." Former Team Principal Christian Horner – speaking before his exit from the team – also dismissed the speculation as “a lot of noise” as he reiterated that Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull through to the end of 2028. During an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X, Button was asked about how possible a straight swap between Verstappen and Russell might be, to which he answered: “I mean, possible.” However, the Briton also acknowledged that a change of team could pose some challenges for Verstappen, who has spent all of his F1 career to date within the Red Bull fold. “It's a tricky one for Max, because he's in a position where he's doing so well with Red Bull – they've given him so much over the years,” said Button. “They've designed this car around him, and he's extremely good at it. If he goes to Mercedes, it's a different thing altogether. You know, that car is not going to be designed around him. “So, to replace Max with him, it just seems like a strange move. “Whereas George is there, he is good, and you need two very competitive drivers with this new era of the sport. So, for me, George and Max would be a better line-up.” Pushed on whether he could see such a partnership working – with Verstappen and Russell having shared some contentious moments on track in recent times – Button conceded: “I would love to see it!”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Pitt's full onboard lap in Lando Norris' McLaren MCL60 Newey started in his new position as Managing Technical Partner of the Silverstone-based squad in March, months after it was confirmed that the Briton would join the team following his departure from Red Bull. During the British Grand Prix weekend, Alonso was quizzed on how much he has been speaking with Newey, leading the Spaniard to give an insight into how the famed designer is already having an impact on Aston Martin. “Generally [focused on] things about the team, about the simulator, how to make things a little bit more realistic, and he has a lot of experience [of] how a top team should fight for championships and try to be on top of the game in every area. When we think about Adrian, it is all aero performance; I think Adrian has a much wider view of how the team should operate, so we all learn from him every time that we speak with him.” It is no secret that Newey has been focusing his attentions on preparing for 2026, a year in which a new wave of technical regulations will be introduced into the sport. Alonso himself is set to remain onboard through next year – but, when asked if he is already thinking about what his future might look like beyond 2026, the 43-year-old responded: “No, not really. “The decision will be made next year, I think, around summer time or before to have things clear as soon as possible. Right now, the championship is challenging this year. Aston Martin currently sit in eighth place of the Teams' Championship, tied on 36 points with seventh-placed Racing Bulls.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Pitt's full onboard lap in Lando Norris' McLaren MCL60 With Valtteri Bottas having been linked to Alpine, Pierre Gasly has given his take on the speculation. The Enstone-based outfit have already made changes to their line-up this season, having opted to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto from Round 7 in Imola onwards. It was then recently revealed that Alpine have enquired about the availability of Mercedes reserve driver Bottas, should they decide to make any further alterations either this year or beyond. With the squad having faced a difficult campaign so far – which has left them at the bottom of the Teams' Championship on 19 points, 10 adrift of Haas in ninth place – Gasly was asked during the British Grand Prix weekend about the Bottas speculation and whether it could be useful for Alpine to have another experienced driver onboard to act as a benchmark. I think the car, I'm showing every weekend what we can do with it, doing a very good job on Saturdays and putting it in places that on paper we all agree we should not really be. We don't have upgrades, the car is not in the best place, but all of us need to focus on what we've got to do and try and do it the best way that we can.” “I think it's just a very tough field. You look a couple of years back, being eight [or] nine-tenths off the fastest car would put you sixth, seventh on the grid. I think everyone has done a very good job, we know the strengths and weaknesses of our package. “But I see a lot of good stuff happening in the team in terms of trying to get the maximum we can. We know the focus is on 2026 and it comes with some compromises on this year, which are tough to take, but hopefully we see the dividends next year.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Pitt's full onboard lap in Lando Norris' McLaren MCL60 In a result that perhaps few would have predicted beforehand, Nico Hulkenberg rose from the back of the grid to third place in the British Grand Prix to seal his long-awaited first podium. While Ferrari team mate – and championship leader – Michael Schumacher found himself out of the running on Lap 1 following a collision with Benetton's Giancarlo Fisichella, Barrichello started to carve his way through the field in a race featuring changing weather conditions. The driver from Sao Paulo handled the subsequent chaos of others crashing, Safety Car phases and further heavy rain to clinch his debut victory in F1, leading to emotional scenes on the podium as Barrichello tearfully processed his achievement. Barrichello went on to achieve a total of 11 victories in Formula 1 – and while none of these took place at his home race, one driver to claim a particularly memorable win in Sao Paulo is Max Verstappen, who pulled off a remarkable comeback drive at the 2024 event. Race day in Brazil had already proven frenetic hours before the Grand Prix, with Qualifying taking place earlier on Sunday after being postponed owing to Saturday's treacherous weather conditions. Amid five red flags in the session after several crashes, another big shock occurred when Verstappen exited Q2 in 12th place, which then became 17th on the grid due to a five-place penalty for using a new power unit. Brazil has certainly seen its fair share of eventful races over the years, with Verstappen's first Interlagos win some five years earlier also featuring an impressive rise through the field from his former team mate, Carlos Sainz. After a challenging few seasons, McLaren looked to be on an upward trajectory in 2019, the team scoring a solid haul of points via their new line-up of Sainz and Lando Norris. A decent result looked like it would be harder to come by at the penultimate round in Sao Paulo, however, with Sainz forced to start from the back of the grid following a loss of power during Saturday's Qualifying. Despite this, the Spaniard made a one-stop strategy work in his favour on Sunday as he powered through from P20 to cross the line in P4 – and with third-placed Lewis Hamilton later receiving a five-second penalty for a collision with Alex Albon, Sainz was promoted to third, handing him his maiden top-three result as well as marking McLaren's first podium finish since 2014. Needless to say, there were countless moments of Ayrton Senna brilliance across his career in Formula 1 – and one of these occurred early on for the Brazilian as F1 hit the streets of Monaco during his debut campaign in 1984. As he searched for a new team, Perez had put in some good performances through 2020 including a second place in Turkey, but his prospects in Sakhir did not initially appear so promising after a collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1 dropped him to the back of the pack. The Mexican admitted to being left “speechless” by the result, which came on his 190th Grand Prix start – and it seemed to be enough to prove to Red Bull that Perez was deserving of a drive, the team announcing within a matter of weeks that they had signed him for 2021. Lewis Hamilton has put in more than one impressive recovery drive during his glittering F1 career to date – and one of the most memorable came at the Belgian Grand Prix in 2016, a year famed for the Briton's fierce title fight with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg. Drama for some of the frontrunners on the opening lap allowed Hamilton to move up to P15, and from there onwards he stayed out of trouble and handled subsequent Safety Car phases and a red flag to cross the line in third place. As well as becoming the longest Formula 1 race ever – at four hours, four minutes and 39 seconds, to be exact – it was made all the more memorable by Jenson Button bouncing back from numerous incidents to seal an against-the-odds victory. After an early clash with McLaren team mate Lewis Hamilton dropped him backwards, Button's afternoon went on to feature everything from a puncture to a drive-through penalty – just one of his six visits to the pits – and a last lap overtake for the lead on Sebastian Vettel to secure an incredible victory. “It felt like I spent more time in the pits than on the pit straights,” Button joked afterwards as he reflected back on his extraordinary comeback drive. After picking off numerous cars, Clark had hauled himself back into P1 with eight laps remaining. But the Scot's victory chances were again dashed when his Lotus experienced a fuel issue on the final tour, meaning that he was passed by John Surtees and Jack Brabham. Despite this, Clark still held onto third place in a drive that has been revered by many as one of his greatest. But when officials had been unable to take a fuel sample from his car post-Qualifying, Vettel – who was by this point engaged in a close title fight with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso – was excluded from the results and started the race from the pit lane. An eventful afternoon followed for the German driver, who recovered from front wing damage early on to pull off a series of overtakes on his rivals. This culminated in a daring move on Jenson Button's McLaren, securing Vettel a stunning podium result in P3 en route to winning his third World Championship at the end of the year. This list would simply not be complete without a mention of John Watson's history-making win at the Long Beach Street Circuit in 1983. Qualifying had not gone well for Watson and his McLaren team mate Niki Lauda, the pair finding themselves down in P22 and P23 respectively after tyre struggles during the session. However, the picture looked very different on race day, with Watson and Lauda both carving their way through the pack to eventually find themselves running in a 1-2 formation.</p>
