                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to a new gene therapy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) developed at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and licensed to the U.S. company Klotho Neurosciences, Inc. The drug uses a viral vector of the AAV (adeno-associated virus) type that expresses the secreted isoform of Klotho (s-KL) protein, with neuroregenerating, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The orphan drug designation for the therapy we have developed acknowledges the relevance of treatments targeting muscle and neuromuscular junction as a strategy for ALS." Assumpció Bosch, principal investigator of the study "To date, we have been able to demonstrate efficacy in a leading animal model for this pathology. We are now testing it in other ALS models to confirm that this therapeutic solution can be applied to the widest possible number of patients", adds Sergi Verdés, postdoctoral researcher on the research team. This recognition offers advantages such as seven years of exclusivity for the drug in the U.S. market, fee waivers and tax incentives for clinical trials. In the interview, Lloyd M. Smith discusses proteoforms, an area of research worthy of the next Human Genome Project. In this interview, the team at n6 discusses their groundbreaking iconPCR thermocycler and its impact on laboratory automation, NGS data quality, and real-time control in life sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OMED Health ("OMED"), a UK-based business pioneering non-invasive breath analysis for gut health and part of Owlstone Medical ("Owlstone"), the global leader in Breath Biopsy® for applications in early disease detection and precision medicine, today announced the launch of OMED Health Plans, personalized treatments and services to help patients gain control of their functional gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, a problem that affects over one billion people worldwide. OMED Health Plans, available first in Great Britain, include the diagnosis of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) through at-home breath testing and substrate tests using the proprietary OMED Health Breath Analyzer, supporting the push to move care from hospitals to communities; clinician-led care pathways including nutritional protocols such as FODMAP and therapeutic interventions; and 1:1 clinical consultation for ongoing expert support. Initially the Plans will be made available through healthcare providers, who will leverage the platform to offer efficient non-invasive GI diagnostics alongside targeted treatment to reduce delivery costs and improve patient outcomes, and to consumers. Digestive health is one of the largest untapped opportunities in consumer-facing diagnostics and chronic disease management, Through the expanded OMED offering, patients with functional GI conditions will for the first time be able to access end-to-end, clinician-led, and evidence-based treatment plans utilizing longitudinal breath monitoring, optimized specifically for them based on their breath profiles." Feedback from participants in pilot programs has been very positive, with many citing significantly improved digestive health following diagnosis of SIBO or IMO using the OMED Breath Analyzer and subsequent treatment and follow-up monitoring. "Owlstone is building a category-defining platform through OMED Health at the intersection of diagnostics, digital health, therapeutics, and personalized care," added Boyle. "With recurring revenue potential, robust unit economics, and a vast addressable market, OMED is well positioned to address a major gap in chronic GI care, enabling rapid growth by providing effective, evidence-based GI care at scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new survey conducted on behalf of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC – James) highlights the widespread emotional impact of cancer, revealing what weighs heavy on the minds of adults when a loved one is diagnosed. Kevin Johns, MD, director of the psychosocial oncology program at the OSUCCC – James said studies suggest that up to cancer patients are five times as likely to experience depression than the average population and an estimated 42% of breast cancer survivors experience anxiety. Depression and anxiety can significantly impact a patient's ability to finish care and fully recover after treatment – all of which impacts long-term survival. Patients going through cancer treatment simply can't wait that long – the need is acute but also chronic, so timely access is critical. Kevin Johns, MD, director of the psychosocial oncology program, OSUCCC – James A recent survey commissioned by the OSUCCC – James among U.S. adults age 18 or older focused on the top concerns when a loved one is diagnosed with cancer. The survey found that over three-quarters of adults surveyed list life expectancy (76%), course of treatment (69%) and pain (65%) as top concerns they have about loved ones diagnosed with cancer. "The complex nature of caregivers' concerns is very representative of the unique challenges we face as a mental health community in supporting our patients through treatment and into their 'new normal' as a cancer survivor," Johns said. Helping our patients thrive beyond the diagnosis through proper mental health care is paramount to achieving high quality of life." Young Americans ages 18-29 are more likely than all other age groups to report grief (66%) as a top concern when a family member is diagnosed with cancer. Conversely, the oldest Americans are more likely than the youngest Americans to say that course of treatment (74%) and caregiver stress (37%) are top concerns for them when a loved one is diagnosed. Johns noted that mental health is especially complicated in the cancer survivor population because challenges can manifest in different ways at different stages of the cancer journey through diagnosis, treatment and survivorship follow-up. He cited cognitive changes, severe fatigue, "brain fog" brought on by the effects of treatment, and even PTSD-like (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms or hallucinations and hospital delirium as side effects of cancer that are not often talked about but that can be very jarring for patients and caregivers alike. "If patients or their caregivers are not warned beforehand that these symptoms can occur, it can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety and shame, so it is very important that we work with our patients and caregivers upfront to prepare them for what might happen," said Johns. Under Johns' leadership, the OSUCCC – James Psychosocial Oncology Program has greatly expanded its team of psychiatric providers, psychologists, social workers and other mental health professionals to support OSUCCC – James patients. In addition, Johns also helped the OSUCCC - James pilot an innovative oncology consulting service to help breast medical oncologists navigate medical management of anxiety and depression among their patients. "Patients going through cancer treatment already have so many appointments, and generally they develop a very close relationship with their medical oncologist, so this practitioner also becomes the default mental health provider if they do not have immediate access to a specialized health care provider," said Johns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rehab hospitals that help people recover from major surgeries and injuries have become a highly lucrative slice of the health care business. But federal data and inspection reports show that some run by the dominant company, Encompass Health Corp., and other for-profit corporations have had rare but serious incidents of patient harm and perform below average on two key safety measures tracked by Medicare. Yet even when inspections reveal grave cases of injury, federal health officials do not inform consumers or impose fines the way they do for nursing homes. In the most serious problems documented by regulators, rehab hospital errors involved patient deaths. In Encompass Health's hospital in Huntington, West Virginia, Elizabeth VanBibber, 73, was fatally poisoned by a carbon monoxide leak during construction at the facility. At its hospital in Jackson, Tennessee, a patient, 68, was found dead overnight, lying on the floor in a "pool of blood" after an alarm that was supposed to alert nurses that he had gotten out of bed had been turned off. In its hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a nurse gave Frederick Roufs, 73, the wrong drug, one of 26 medication errors the hospital made over six months. "I can still see Fred laying in the bed as they shut each little machine off," said his widow, Susan Roufs. Encompass, which owns 168 hospitals and admitted 248,000 patients last year, has led the transformation of this niche industry. In 2023, stand-alone for-profit medical rehabilitation hospitals overtook nonprofits as the places where the majority of annual patient admissions occur, a KFF Health News and New York Times analysis found. A third of all admissions were to Encompass hospitals. These hospitals collectively generate profits of 10%, more than general hospitals, which earn about 6%, and far more than skilled nursing homes, which make less than 0.5%, according to the most recent data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent congressional agency. At the same time, the number of small, specialized units within acute care hospitals — where most rehab used to be provided — has dwindled. In its latest annual report, Encompass, which is publicly traded, reported an 11% net profit in 2024, earning $597 million last year on revenues of $5.4 billion. Federal data on the performance of about 1,100 of the rehab facilities show Encompass tends to be better at helping most patients return home and remain there. In a two-year period ending in September 2023, Medicare rated 233 rehab facilities as performing better than the national rate for this major metric, called "discharge to community." Most rehabs with better community discharge rates are for-profit, and Encompass owns 79 of them. But data from Medicare also reveals Encompass owns many of the rehabs with worse rates of potentially preventable, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Medicare evaluates how often patients are rehospitalized for conditions that might have been averted with proper care, including infections, bedsores, dehydration, and kidney failures. Encompass accounts for about 1 in 7 rehab facilities nationally, but owned 34 of the 41 inpatient rehab facilities that Medicare rated as having statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions for discharged patients. Patrick Darby, the executive vice president and general counsel of Encompass, strongly defended the company's record in written responses to questions. He dismissed Medicare's readmissions ratings of "better," "worse," and "no different than the national rate" as "a crude scoring measure" and said "performance is so similar across the board." He called the violations found during health inspections "rare occurrences" that "do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns." "The simplest and most accurate reason for EHC's success is that our hospitals provide superior care to patients," he said, referring to Encompass by its corporate initials. Chih-Ying Li, an associate professor of occupational therapy at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston School of Health Professions, said in an interview that a research study she conducted found the profit status of a rehab facility was the only characteristic associated with higher unplanned readmissions. By that time, VanBibber's blood oxygen levels were dangerously low, the inspection report said. In court papers, Encompass and its construction contractors denied negligence for VanBibber's death. Inspectors determined Encompass failed to maintain a safe environment for all patients during construction and didn't properly evaluate other patients for signs of poisoning, the report said. Since 2021, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees health inspections, has found that 10 Encompass hospitals, including the one that cared for VanBibber, had immediate jeopardy violations, federal records show. Such violations — like the ones that Medicare also found in connection with the deaths of Roufs and the patient who fell after leaving his bed — mean a hospital's failure to comply with federal rules has put patients at risk for serious injury, serious harm, serious impairment, or death. He said Encompass that has an "excellent compliance record," including superior results from its accreditation agency, and that its overall number of health citations was tiny given how many hospitals Encompass owns and how many patients it treats. Six other corporate-operated for-profit hospitals were also cited, while none of the 31 stand-alone nonprofit rehab hospitals received such violations from 2021 to 2024. (Inspection reports for general hospitals do not systematically specify in which part of the building a violation occurred, so rehab unit violations cannot be identified.) An alert called a bed alarm was at the root of immediate jeopardies at Encompass hospitals in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Jackson, Tennessee. Medicare is not authorized by law to fine rehab hospitals for safety rule violations, even ones involving deaths uncovered during inspections, as it has done with nearly 8,000 nursing homes during the last three years, imposing average fines of about $28,000. The only option is to entirely cut off a rehab hospital's reimbursement for all services by Medicare and Medicaid, which cover most patients. "Termination is typically a last resort after working with the provider to come back into compliance," Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson, said in an email. As a result, because there's no graduated penalty, even the most serious — and rare — immediate jeopardy violations effectively carry no punishments so long as the hospital puts steps in place to avert future problems. One immediate jeopardy incident did result in a punishment, but only because the hospital was in California, which allows its health department to issue penalties. Encompass' Bakersfield hospital paid a $75,000 fine last year for failing to control the blood sugar of a patient who died after her heart stopped. It plans to open 17 more hospitals in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah by the end of 2027, according to its latest report. It frequently moves into new markets by persuading local nonprofit hospitals to shutter their rehab units in exchange for an equity stake in a newly built Encompass hospital, company executives have told investors. Tarr, who was paid $9.3 million in compensation last year, told investors that Encompass requires that the existing hospitals sign a noncompete deal. Sixty-seven Encompass hospitals are joint ventures, mostly with nonprofit hospitals as investors, according to the company's June financial filing, the most recent available. Darby said the company's profits allow it to build hospitals in areas that lack intensive inpatient rehabilitation and improve existing hospitals. "High-quality patient care is not only consistent with shareholder return, but quality and shareholder return are in fact critical to one another," he said. The success of Encompass is particularly notable given that it barely survived what experts said was one of the largest modern accounting scandals in 2003. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that the company, then known as HealthSouth, overstated earnings by $2.7 billion to meet Wall Street analyst quarterly expectations, leading to the ouster of its founder and directors. The company denied any wrongdoing, blaming independent physicians who worked at its hospitals. Darby said Encompass settled the case only to "avoid more years of expense and disruption." He said the Justice Department never filed a lawsuit despite years of investigation. Rehab hospital inspection reports are not posted on Care Compare, Medicare's online search tool for consumers. KFF Health News had to sue CMS under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain all its inspection reports for rehab hospitals. In contrast, Care Compare publishes all nursing home inspection reports and assigns each facility a star rating for its adherence to health and safety rules. So people now choosing a rehab hospital would not know that at the Encompass hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 2021, a nurse accidentally gave Roufs a blood pressure drug called hydralazine instead of hydroxyzine, his prescribed anti-anxiety medication, according to an inspection report. Months before, an internal safety committee had identified a trend of medication errors, including when a nurse accidentally gave a patient 10 times the prescribed amount of insulin, sending him to the hospital, the inspection report said. Since Roufs's death, inspectors have faulted the hospital six times for various lapses, most recently in April 2024 for improper wound care. An Encompass hospital in Texarkana, Texas, misused antipsychotic medications to pacify patients, resulting in an immediate jeopardy finding from CMS, the report said. And the company's hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, was issued an immediate jeopardy violation for not keeping track of medication orders in 2023, when a patient had a cardiac arrest after not receiving all of his drugs, according to the inspection report. The federal government's overall quality oversight efforts are limited. Medicare docks payment to rehab facilities for patients readmitted to a general hospital during shorter-than-average rehab stays, but unlike at general hospitals, there are no financial penalties when recently discharged rehab patients are hospitalized for critical health issues. The Trump administration has not determined whether it will continue the effort to rate rehab facilities, according to a CMS spokesperson. His medical records, provided to reporters by the family, list a sitting tolerance of one hour. He said no hospital with long-term patients could prevent every new or worsening pressure sore, but that Encompass' rates were similar to the 1% national average. One of Webb's sons, Darel Webb, recalled a warning given to the family as they left an appointment their father had with wound specialists: A doctor brought up Christopher Reeve, the actor who played Superman in movies in the 1970s and 1980s. Jordan Rau has been writing about hospital safety since 2008. Irena Hwang is a New York Times data reporter who uses computational tools to uncover hidden stories and illuminate the news. To examine the medical rehabilitation hospital industry, we obtained and analyzed a database of inspection reports of freestanding rehabilitation hospitals from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. We also obtained inspection reports from several states through public records requests. We analyzed inpatient rehabilitation facility characteristics and patient volume data contained in hospital data files from the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization. This dataset compiles cost reports all hospitals submit each year to CMS. For each facility for the years 2012 to 2023, we categorized annual discharges by facility type (freestanding rehabilitation hospital or unit within an acute care hospital); facility ownership status (for-profit, nonprofit, or government); and which hospitals were owned by Encompass Health under its current or prior name, HealthSouth. Financial information about Encompass Health was obtained from the company's Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure filings. We examined the readmission rates for all inpatient rehabilitation facilities that CMS publishes in its quality data. CMS evaluates the frequency with which Medicare patients were readmitted for potentially preventable reasons to an acute care hospital during their rehab stay. Separately, CMS also evaluates the frequency of potentially preventable readmissions to an acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from rehab. We also examined the rate of successful return to home or community. The most recent readmission data covered Medicare discharges from October 2021 through September 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New study shows that autism is not one condition, but four, each driven by different genes and brain development patterns, helping to reshape diagnosis and care. Study: Decomposition of phenotypic heterogeneity in autism reveals underlying genetic programs. A paper published in Nature Genetics provides a new glimpse into the role of genetic variation in the range of clinical symptoms found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The team of researchers found that autism classes can be clinically distinguished. Each is associated with unique patterns of gene dysregulation, reflecting distinct molecular-level perturbations caused by class-specific sets of mutations. ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties with social communication and interaction, often demonstrating restricted and repetitive behavior patterns, interests, or activities. With an increasing ASD burden each year, the phenotypic and genetic differences in the ASD pool are becoming more obvious. A systematic evidence-based association study of genetic and phenotypic data has not matched the genetic and phenotypic complexity of ASD. The current study used a large sample of autism phenotypes to reveal phenotypic classes and the underlying genetic heterogeneity. A person-centric method is essential in this analysis, rather than focusing on single traits, since each co-occurring trait inevitably affects the other. Only then can they be properly mapped to their genotypic origin. Such an approach provides a clearer picture of how these developmental disruptions interact and evolve, allowing for an informed prognosis. This approach avoids the limitation of traditional trait-centric analyses and better captures the complex, interacting nature of ASD symptoms in real individuals. They collected phenotypic data from standard diagnostic questionnaires (the Social Communication Questionnaire-Lifetime (SCQ), Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), and the Child Behavior Checklist 6–18 (CBCL), combined with the developmental milestone history. Researchers applied a generative finite mixture modelling (GFMM) framework to analyze 239 features, allowing individuals to be grouped into clinically meaningful phenotypic classes based on their overall trait profiles. The model distinguished autism classes using the seven core traits: limited social communication, restricted and/or repetitive behavior, attention deficit, disruptive behavior, anxiety and/or mood symptoms, developmental delay (DD), self-injury, and the severity of symptoms. One class (Social/behavioral) had both severe social communication deficits and restricted or repetitive behavior, compared to other ASD children. They also showed disruptive behavior and attention deficit, with anxiety, but normal developmental rates. The Mixed ASD class distinctively shows developmental delay, despite some features of social communication deficits, restricted/repetitive behavior, and self-injury. The other two classes were Moderate challenges, with a lower ASD score for all seven core traits than other ASD children but above non-autistic siblings, and Broadly affected, with a higher score than other ASD children. These classes were validated by their agreement with the reported co-occurring conditions, parental narratives, and medical history. For instance, the Broadly affected class was much more likely to have all co-occurring conditions: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), delayed language development, anxiety, and depression. In contrast, the Social/behavioral class had a higher risk of ASD-associated ADHD, anxiety, and depression diagnoses. Mixed ASD and Broadly affected classes were usually diagnosed the earliest. They were most likely to be receiving a variety of therapies, due to the highest cognitive impairment and poor language skills. The model showed a high correlation in feature enrichment patterns across the SPARK and SSC cohorts, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. The scientists then investigated genetic influences using polygenic scores (PGS) for autism and five well-accepted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for autism-related conditions or traits. They explored both inherited and newly arising genetic variations. Depression-related PGS and diagnosis rate were both highest in the Social/behavioral class. This class also had the highest number of high-impact variants in neuronal genes, mainly expressed after birth. However, ASD PGS did not differ significantly between classes due to high within-group variance, highlighting the limited explanatory power of current common-variant-based ASD scores. Thus, “co-occurring conditions were associated with common genetic variation that significantly differed among the four identified classes.” All four classes had more mutations than non-autistic siblings, and mutations were unevenly distributed between the classes. Whilst all four classes showed more mutations than non-ASD siblings, the Broadly affected class had the highest high-impact de novo mutations. In contrast, the Mixed ASD class showed increased rare inherited variation alongside de novo mutations, indicating a stronger inherited genetic component. ASD-specific gene set analysis showed a higher burden of new LoF mutations associated with developmental delay. High-impact mutations in a relatively small group of genes contribute to cognitive impairment. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) target gene mutations were especially enriched in the Broadly affected class and the Mixed ASD class. The Broadly affected class showed additional enrichment for mood and behavioral traits such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and aggression. Tracing the molecular pathways affected by these mutations showed that each class reflected specific pathway disruptions. For instance, disruption of microtubule activity, chromatin organization, and DNA repair was enriched in the Social/behavioral class, compared to neuronal action potential and membrane depolarization in Mixed ASD. In the Mixed ASD class, LoF mutations affected prefrontal cortical neuronal genes expressed primarily during fetal and early newborn life. The Broadly affected class showed gene dysregulation spanning all developmental stages and cell types, especially of FMRP target genes and highly constrained genes. In contrast, the Moderate challenges class had enrichment for variants in genes with lower evolutionary constraint, which may explain the milder developmental impact. The study demonstrated the value of a person-centered rather than a trait-centric approach to ASD genotype-phenotype analysis. The four phenotype-based classes described here agreed with reported clinical features and can be applied to any clinical cohort. Importantly, it suggests that ASD phenotypes do not reflect a spectrum of intellectual disability. The study provides a framework to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying distinct ASD presentations, supported by genetic and molecular data across developmental stages. These findings suggest new research directions to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying different ASD presentations, allowing for more precise diagnosis and management of these conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New survey data from the Orlando Health Spine Center reveals a significant difference among Americans on how to manage neck and back pain. Respondents were split between relying on rest and reduced activity (44%), turning to over-the-counter pain relievers (42%), and hot/cold therapies (29%) - an uncertainty that may be discouraging some from seeking medical guidance. We want patients living their best life. Dr. Braithwaite determines the best course of treatment for each patient at the Orlando Health Spine Center by starting with thorough examinations and images such as MRI or CT scans, ensuring a personalized approach to pain management. "Once we have a good idea of what's causing their pain, then it's easy to come up with the plan," said Dr. Braithwaite. "It's very important that we're able to offer patients conservative alternatives because many times they don't need anything invasive to feel better." Reeta Brendamour, 66, experienced excruciating shoulder pain and arm numbness that kept her from enjoying her favorite activities and a once-active lifestyle. She initially tried home remedies and avoided seeing a doctor, concerned that surgery might be her only option. According to the survey, she's not alone, only 5% of Americans consider surgery their top option for relieving pain. When the pain became too much to bear, Reeta scheduled an appointment with Dr. Braithwaite, who diagnosed her with arthritis and degenerative disc disease. She learned the pain she was experiencing stemmed from her neck and he recommended steroid injections to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain. The treatment allowed her to return to activities she loves, including golfing, teaching yoga and traveling the world. Dr. Braithwaite reminds patients that aging doesn't have to mean living in pain. "Your body doesn't heal like it used to, so it may require injection therapy or other treatments to accelerate the healing process and provide a full recovery." The Orlando Health Spine Center offers a comprehensive range of treatments for various conditions. "It's a one-stop shop - no matter what's going on with a patient's spine, neck or lower back, we can evaluate and help them feel better," said Dr. Braithwaite. "Whether it's conservative treatment, physical therapy or imaging, everything can be done in-house to help patients find relief." This survey was conducted online within the United States by Ipsos on the KnowledgePanel® from May 30 to June 1, 2025, and surveyed 1,024 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This poll is based on a nationally representative probability sample and has margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points at the 95%confidence level, for results based on the entire sample of adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lower levels of certain vitamins and minerals were found to be associated with chronic pain in a recently completed study led by researchers at the University of Arizona Health Sciences and published in Pain Practice. This is the first study to take a precision medicine approach to chronic pain on a large scale by broadly examining micronutrient levels of people with and without chronic pain and exploring the incidence of chronic pain in people with or without micronutrient deficiencies. The findings could inform personalized nutritional strategies to help manage chronic pain. "I treat chronic pain patients, and oftentimes we don't come up with a diagnosis. But just because there isn't a surgery that will help you doesn't mean you're not in pain. This study is a novel way to approach chronic pain treatment, where you are looking at the patient holistically to see what could be going on systemically that is easily modifiable – changes in diet as opposed to medications or other things." The research team focused on five micronutrients commonly associated with chronic pain: vitamins D, B12, and C, folate and magnesium. They found that for vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium, people with severe deficiencies were more likely to have severe chronic pain. Conversely, lower levels of vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium – and a greater incidence of those low levels – were seen in people with severe chronic pain. "The finding that surprised us the most was that Asian females had higher vitamin B12 levels than expected," said co-author Deborah Morris, PhD, a research laboratory manager in the Department of Neurosurgery, explaining that B12 deficiencies were seen in other gender, race and ethnicity groups. "Asian females with severe chronic pain had the highest vitamin B12 levels overall. The results varied for vitamin C, where males with mild-to-moderate and severe chronic pain were more likely to have low and borderline low levels of vitamin C than males without chronic pain. Men with borderline and severe vitamin C deficiency were also more likely to have chronic pain. "The findings that are coming from complex demographic studies such as this one show that we can't just make assumptions for every patient that walks in the office," said Pilitsis, who is a member of the BIO5 Institute. "Our study across various chronic pain conditions in a large, diverse population found that certain vitamins and mineral deficiencies are more frequent in people with chronic pain, and particularly in some in specific racial and ethnic groups," Morris added. "Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people with chronic pain and reduce opioid usage, and these findings have the potential to do that as part of a holistic approach to pain management." A November 2024 data brief from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that nearly 25% of U.S. adults are living with chronic pain, which is associated with decreased quality of life, opioid misuse, increased anxiety and depression, and unmet mental health needs. Morris and Pilitsis collaborated with researchers at Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Grigore T. Popa in Romania, and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Popular anti-obesity medications continue to be effective for weight loss even when availability and access is interrupted, according to a study being presented by a private weight-loss company Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. "Patients taking GLP-1 treatments like semaglutide and tirzepatide often face challenges consistently accessing their medications due to supply shortages or insurance coverage obstacles," said Kaelen L. Medeiros, M.S., director of data and research at privately held weight-loss company Calibrate in New York, N.Y. While unpredictable GLP-1 medication access is frustrating, the good news is that our research shows effective weight loss can still be achieved if paired with appropriate lifestyle changes and coaching support." Researchers looked at how interruptions to GLP-1 medication access impacted weight-loss outcomes in real-world patients taking part in a commercial metabolic health program that also included intensive lifestyle intervention. The study reviewed records for 6,392 participants who had at least one month of GLP-1 access and completed at least one year in an obesity and overweight care program. Of these participants, 72.5% experienced at least one disruption in their GLP-1 treatment and 11.1% had multiple disruptions. Participants received an average of 8.13 GLP-1 fills during the first year of research and 15.25 fills during the second year. Those who received only 1 to 4 treatments over 12 months also achieved clinically significant weight loss, with more than 10% change in body weight on average. "Given the often-unpredictable availability and shifting insurance coverage associated with anti-obesity medications, it's important that patients understand the significant impact that lifestyle changes and coaching paired with treatment can have on their health outcomes," Medeiros said. While findings indicate that significant weight loss is still possible for those with inconsistent access to GLP-1 medications, Medeiros said the results found that a consistent medication course combined with lifestyle changes and support remains the most effective weight-loss program option.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adrenal hormone function was restored in animal studies, potentially paving the way for a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency in humans, according to research being presented by Aspect Biosystems on Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. However, the current hormone replacement therapies have a significant treatment burden and fail to mimic the natural circadian rhythms of hormone secretion. Our research shows that our adrenal Bioprinted Tissue Therapeutics (BTTs)-an 'off-the-shelf,' implantable cell therapy-can restore natural hormone function and perform long-term in animals, demonstrating its potential to offer a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency." The company's adrenal Bioprinted Tissue Therapeutics (BTTs) were studied in vitro to confirm their viability over time. The BTTs were then implanted into mice that had undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands. "Following implantation, mice that received adrenal BTTs showed a rapid and sustained increase in circulating cortisol, which is not endogenously produced in mice," Wadsworth said. This confirmed that the adrenal BTTs were responsive. "Notably, cortisol secretion followed the animals' circadian rhythm, replicating their natural daily hormone cycle," Wadsworth said. "In contrast, mice implanted with cell-free implants showed no significant cortisol levels and did not respond to ACTH stimulation." "This novel approach has the potential to serve as a functional cure for primary adrenal insufficiency, transforming the lives of patients with this disease," Wadsworth said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel AI-powered retina tracker can analyze retinal images with near-perfect accuracy in under one second, according to a study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. The researchers say the findings offer hope for sight-saving screenings for diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases that are fast, affordable, and accessible worldwide. The application, an AI-based model integrated into Simple Mobile AI Retina Tracker (SMART), uses cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to analyze retinal fundus images quickly and accurately, on internet-powered devices including basic smartphones. Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of preventable blindness, affects over 100 million people globally as the incidence and prevalence of diabetes continue to rise worldwide. Two researchers, Ramya Elangovan and Kavin Elangovan of AIM Doctor in Houston, Texas, sourced several thousand anonymized retinal images from multiple datasets representing diverse populations spanning six continents. These images were used to train and validate deep learning models capable of detecting and staging diabetic retinopathy with over 99% accuracy in under one second. The tracker was also able to differentiate diabetic retinopathy from similar eye pathologies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anti-obesity medications can significantly raise testosterone levels and improve health outcomes for men with obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to a new study being presented Monday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif. Testosterone not only plays a critical role in the body when it comes to male sexual functioning, but it can also have an impact on an individual's bone mass, fat distribution, muscle mass, strength and red blood cell production. Increases in body weight and prevalence of type 2 diabetes are often associated with lowered testosterone levels, resulting in fatigue, decreased libido and quality of life. While it is well known that weight loss from lifestyle changes or bariatric surgery increases testosterone levels, the impact that anti-obesity medications may also have on these levels has not been widely studied. Our study is among the first to provide compelling evidence that low testosterone can be reversed with the use of commonly prescribed anti-obesity medications." To test this hypothesis, researchers analyzed the electronic health records of 110 adult men with obesity or type 2 diabetes being treated with the weight-loss medications semaglutide, dulaglutide or tirzepatide and who were not on testosterone or hormonal therapy. Along with 10% weight loss, the proportion of men with normal levels of both total and free testosterone rose from 53% to 77%. These findings indicate that anti-obesity medications also can have a positive effect on the reproductive health of men with obesity or type 2 diabetes. "Results from this study show that there is a direct correlation between the use of anti-obesity medications and testosterone levels," said Portillo Canales. "Doctors and their patients can now consider this class of medications not only for the treatment of obesity and to control blood sugar, but also to benefit men's reproductive health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a serious kidney disease in children with no clear cause. The study found that these autoantibodies are present during active diseases and decline when symptoms subside, suggesting potential for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Mouse models were further used to validate these findings. Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), particularly prevalent in children, is a kidney disorder marked by severe protein loss in the urine and low blood protein (albumin) levels. Growing body of research has shown that autoantibodies, or antibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body's own cells and proteins against podocytes may play a role in INS, but the precise underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Their findings were published online in Research on June 3, 2025. The research team was led by Dr. Hanyan Meng from the Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China, sought to investigate the pathogenic role and underlying mechanisms of anti-vinculin autoantibodies in INS. What exactly is vinculin, and why does it matter in kidney health? These proteins are particularly found in podocytes and critical for podocyte cytoskeletal integrity. Anti-vinculin autoantibodies—the body's own antibodies that attack vinculin—can cause damage to the kidney's filtering cells. By analyzing serum samples from across 147 children with INS, the researchers discovered significantly elevated levels of anti-vinculin autoantibodies compared to healthy and disease control groups. These antibodies were present in over half of the INS patients and closely correlated with the clinical markers of disease severity, including cholesterol levels and protein in urine." Notably, the antibody levels dropped as the children recovered, and over half of them no longer had these antibodies once their symptoms subsided. The team further conducted a series of experiments using mouse models to understand causality. When injected with anti-vinculin antibodies or when actively immunized with recombinant vinculin protein, the mice developed hallmark features of INS, including proteinuria (high levels of protein in urine) and cell injury, which were confirmed via immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. This suggests that anti-vinculin antibodies may not only damage podocytes directly but also activate a broader immune response that worsens the disease. "These findings provide compelling evidence that anti-vinculin autoantibodies are not merely markers but active drivers of disease," highlights Dr. Meng. "They could serve as dynamic biomarkers for early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and risk stratification in pediatric nephrotic syndrome." These findings add up to our understanding of INS and contribute to a growing body of work suggesting that various autoantibodies—against nephrin, Crb2, podocin, and other proteins found in the kidney's filtering units—may underlie different forms of kidney disease. Since vinculin is a critical structural protein in podocytes, its disruption by autoantibodies leads to loss of structural integrity and breakdown of the kidney's filtration barrier. The current study found that anti-vinculin antibodies were more prevalent in patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), suggesting their potential role in guiding treatment strategies. "By adding antibody screening into routine clinical assessment, we may be able to reduce the need for invasive kidney biopsies and tailor better therapies to individual patients," adds Dr. Meng. In the future, their research will focus on how these autoantibodies are generated and how they access intracellular targets like vinculin, building on the understanding of INS and better strategies to overcome the disease. Autoantibodies Targeting Vinculin Reveal Novel Insight into the Mechanisms of Autoimmune Podocytopathies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research uncovers just how much ultra-processed, high-energy food fills Australian supermarket shelves for children, raising alarms about kids' diets and calling for tougher food rules. Study: Energy Density and Level of Processing of Packaged Food and Beverages Intended for Consumption by Australian Children. They found that 56% of the products they surveyed were high in ED (≥12.552 kJ/g or kJ/mL) while 81% were ultra-processed foods (UPFs; NOVA G4), highlighting the urgent need to introduce stricter regulations for food marketed to children. Childhood obesity is a growing health issue in Australia, with one in four children (25.1%) affected (17% overweight and 8.1% obese). A poor diet, particularly high intake of ultra-processed and energy-dense foods, plays a significant role in this trend. ED refers to the amount of energy (kilojoules) per gram or millilitre of food, and it is influenced mainly by fat (high ED) and water content (low ED). Foods with high ED are often less nutritious and linked to higher energy intake and weight gain. UPFs, the most industrially processed category in the NOVA classification, often contain additives and modified ingredients to improve taste, appearance, and shelf life. These features can disrupt appetite regulation, leading to overeating and obesity in children. Despite this, children regularly consume large amounts of UPFs and high-ED foods. Baby food dominated the under-5 market (95% of products), and over half of these items (57%) were ultra-processed, including growing-up milks marketed as supplements. This study was the first in Australia to assess the packaged food environment for children using both ED and NOVA classifications over a 10-year period. The findings could support the development of stronger food marketing regulations for children and promote healthier food environments. They sourced food data from Mintel GNPD, a global dataset that tracks new products in major Australian supermarkets. Data collected included product names, ingredients, nutritional information, and energy values. Products with vague ingredient lists were conservatively classified into lower NOVA groups. Duplicate products and those with missing nutritional data were excluded. Even supposedly 'light' foods like fruit snacks and flavoured yoghurts often fell into the ultra-processed category, challenging the idea that low energy density always means healthy. Baby foods dominated the products for children under 5, while bakery, snacks, and confectionery items made up the bulk of products for older children. Over half (56%) of all products were classified as high in ED, with the highest EDs observed in categories like snacks, confectionery, and chocolate. In contrast, baby food had the lowest median ED. Regarding processing level, 81% of all products were classified as UPFs, including 93% of those for children between 5 and 12 years old, and 59% for those under 5 years old. Significant differences between ED and NOVA categories were found only among foods for children under 5 years old (p<0.001), with high-ED products being more common in the UPF category for this group. No significant differences were found for children between 5 and 12, as most products were UPFs regardless of ED. Low-ED UPFs, often perceived as healthy, such as fruit snacks, flavoured yoghurts, baby cereals, and growing-up milks, were also common, raising concerns about their potential impact on children's energy intake and appetite regulation. The study flags a specific regulatory gap: growing-up milks (GUMs) – ultra-processed, high in free sugars, and not recommended by health authorities – faced no marketing restrictions despite their prevalence. This study is the first in Australia to examine both energy density and food processing levels in products marketed to children. It found that most new packaged foods over the past decade were ultra-processed and energy-dense, particularly those for children between 5 and 12. The findings raise concerns, especially for young children under 5, who are increasingly exposed to UPFs despite dietary guidelines promoting minimally processed foods during early development. A key strength of the study is its use of a global database that captures recent trends in the marketplace. It also compared products across two age groups, offering valuable insights. Additionally, the subjective nature of processing classification was addressed through a conservative approach: when ingredient lists were vague, products were classified into lower NOVA groups. The study underscores the need for policy actions, such as stricter regulation of marketing and health claims, to reduce children's exposure to high-ED and UPF products and promote healthier food choices from an early age.
