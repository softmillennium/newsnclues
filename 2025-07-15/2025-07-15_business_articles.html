                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday as worries over U.S. inflation and a mixed bag of big bank earnings dragged the blue-chip index lower. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a boost from gains in Nvidia. The 30-stock Dow lost 436.36 points, or 0.98%, and closed at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 lost 0.40% and closed at 6,243.76, easing from a fresh record high reached earlier in the session. The Nasdaq was an outperformer, adding 0.18% and posting a record close of 20,677.80. The tech-heavy index was aided by a 4% rise in Nvidia shares after the chip company said it hopes to "soon" resume deliveries of its H20 GPU sales to China. June inflation data released Tuesday represented an increase from May levels, despite the headline numbers matching expectations. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1. "The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury. "While there was a mild miss in the core number, both the main and underlying inflation measures are now printing at their highest levels in four months. The big fear for Fed officials is that stormier waters lie ahead, as not only is there a time lag between the tariffs and an increase to prices, but additional tariff hikes on 1st August would almost certainly herald further inflationary pressures ahead," Ryan added. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report coming in-line with expectations, but that "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming." On the earnings front, reports from several financial heavyweights failed to impress investors. Wells Fargo beat earnings, but a reduction in net interest income guidance sent shares lower by more than 5%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged lower even though the bank posted better-than-expected second-quarter results driven by strong trading and investment banking revenue. Asset manager BlackRock slipped nearly 6% on a quarterly revenue miss. Wall Street is hoping that the second-quarter earnings season will boost a stock market that's already near all-time highs. Expectations are low ahead of the reports, however. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% on Tuesday to close at 6,243.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 436.36 points, or 0.98%, ending at 44,023.29. Several crypto-related legislative measures failed to beat a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. The vote came in at 196 to 223, with 13 Republican lawmakers siding with Democrats to block the procedural motion. "The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets â€“ Nobody does it better!" Crypto-linked stocks traded lower, with Circle Internet Group dropping 4% and Coinbase Global losing 1%. The firm downgraded Southwest Airlines stock to in line from outperform on Tuesday, alongside a $40 per share price target. Evercore's forecast implies roughly 6% upside from Monday's $37.70 close. The stock has gained about 11% so far in 2025. "Southwest is in the process of implementing numerous logical changes which should help its lagging margins begin to recover by 4Q25. Trading at 36x '25E, 11x '26E EPS, we believe shares are now much closer to fair value and are beginning to more fully price in clean execution of these initiatives into next year," analyst Duane Pfennigwerth wrote. A social media analysis shows consumers are lovin' McDonald's new menu item, according to Wolfe Research. "But are waiting to see what happens after initial trial." The fast food giant brought its chicken wrap back to menus last week after originally being discontinued in 2016. Badishkanian said social media checks and industry conversations imply the item is doing well so far. Badishkanian also said the product should perform better than McCrispy strips, another new release, given what he called pent-up excitement and because of the fact that it was a prior fan favorite. McDonald's shares ticked lower in Tuesday session, putting a four-day win streak at risk. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Tuesday that he would buy his own stock, which was down more than 5% on the heels of the asset manager's weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. "They think our expenses may be too high, and our expenses are all front loaded," Fink said on "Money Movers." "Long term, I'm a huge buyer of BlackRock at these prices," he continued. Fink also called the artificial intelligence infrastructure opportunity for BlackRock "enormous" and said that he believes infrastructure investing is "at the beginning of a golden age." Jefferies is stepping to the sidelines on DoorDash following its recent outperformance. Shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after analyst John Colantuoni downgraded shares of the food delivery company to hold from buy. His updated price target implies slight upside of about 3% from Monday's close. This comes as the stock has jumped almost 42% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of more than 6%. "Our profit decomposition supports upside to cons and peer-leading EBITDA growth, but likely not enough to justify continued outperformance without assigning optimistic multiples to DASH's non-core businesses," the analyst wrote. "We also think a recent ramp in affordability initiatives could limit upside to take rate." "With the stock up 45% YTD and valuation at a 120% premium to Internet, we downgrade to Hold given DASH's strong execution and growth algorithm appear fully reflected," he continued. While Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally remains optimistic that the Trump administration will come to a negotiated tariff deal that will be a positive for automakers, he is cautious on Tesla. "We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL," he wrote, citing several factors for his concern. McNally said "long-term negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated," with fiscal 2026 earnings per share on pace to be about 85% lower than 2022 predictions. He's also worried about a disappointing autonomous vehicle rollout, "divisive political posting," and technical moves in the stock that are on the edge of turning negative. Tesla stock has fallen more than 21% year to date, but was slightly positive in Tuesday's session. In the near term, McNally said he is expecting second-quarter profits in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents per share, which is below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 44 cents. The S&P 500 has posted 55 days above its 20-day moving average, the longest such streak going back to January 2021 when it was 56 days, according to BTIG. The 20-day moving average, which indicates short-term trends, is at around 6,144. The long streak is a bullish long-term signal for the stock market, suggesting the S&P 500 can continue to climb higher now that it's back to trading around all-time highs. "We are clearly stretching the limits of time without a 20 DMA break, and former such streaks often led to periods of volatility or consolidation," BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky wrote Monday. Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials jumped more than 25% Tuesday on a $500 million deal to supply Apple with magnets that are manufactured at a plant in Texas. MP will provide Apple with rare earth magnets made from recycled materials at its Independence plant in Forth Worth. President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, following an inflation report that showed prices rising but mostly in line with market expectations. One Trillion Dollars a year would be saved!!!" Core inflation also moved higher, rising 0.2%, with a 2.9% annual rate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher by 25 points, or less than 0.1%. Shares of Citigroup rose modestly in premarket trading after second-quarter results topped Wall Street expectations. Here's how Citigroup's results compare to Wall Street expectations: Read the full list of stocks moving here. Inflation rose as expected for June, with the consumer price index advancing 2.7% year over year and 0.3% month over month. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew by 0.2% for the month. Factory activity in the New York area surged in July, posting its first positive reading since February as shipments, inventory and employment grew and optimism for the future also improved, according to the regional Federal Reserve Announcements from a handful of major tech companies on Tuesday spurred enthusiasm around AI stocks, lifting the broader market higher in premarket trading. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.8% in the premarket after the company lowered its 2025 net income guidance to roughly in line with 2024 levels. The bank previously expected an increase of 1% to 3%. Investment banking and trading revenue drove the stronger-than-expected numbers. Shares of Nvidia jumped 4.5% in premarket trade on Tuesday, after the company said it was hopeful it could soon resume sales of its H20 chips to China. "The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 benchmark ended the day 0.7% higher at 8,630.30. Over in India, the 50-stock benchmark Nifty 50 was up 0.43%, while the Sensex index moved up 0.31% as of 1.55 p.m. Indian Standard time (4.25 a.m. We're just over half an hour into Tuesday's trading session, and European shares are broadly moving higher. Regional shares are coming off of a mostly losing session on Monday, as investors reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to to slap 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union next month. The inflation reading is due out Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. Companies have a low bar to clear this earnings season. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% in the second quarter, on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. Advertising tech company The Trade Desk will become part of the S&P 500, effective before trading opens on Friday, July 18, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Just last week, Wall Street firm Stephens predicted that The Trade Desk could be a potential contender to join the S&P 500's communications services sector, which is an underweight grouping in the index. The Trade Desk will replace software company Ansys, which is on track to be acquired by Synopsys on or about Thursday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 27 points, or 0.06%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several cryptocurrency regulation bills backed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives, dealing a major blow to the crypto industry. The vote, during what is being billed as "Crypto Week," was a rare instance of House Republicans refusing to take direction from Trump. The measures had been widely expected to pass. It was unclear whether the second vote would be for an identical rule and the same bills, or whether House Republican leaders would make changes to the package to satisfy GOP caucus members who opposed the motion. Crypto-linked stocks turned lower after the vote failed. Shares of the stablecoin company Circle dropped more than 7% on the news, while Coinbase fell more than 4%. Shares of the digital asset firm MARA Holdings dipped more than 2%. The GENIUS Act seeks to regulate stablecoins. Another bill, the CLARITY Act, would establish rules for whether an asset is regulated as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission or as a commodity overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The third proposal would prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of the Republicans who opposed the measure, wrote in a post on, "I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments to the GENIUS Act." "President Trump included a ban on CBDC in his January 23rd executive order and Congress must also include the ban on CBDC in the GENIUS Act," Greene wrote. Trump had hailed "Crypto Week" during a post on his Truth Social earlier Tuesday and urged all House Republicans to vote "yes" on the measure. "The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets - Nobody does it better!" "The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it," he wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday said the Trump administration reversed course on allowing Nvidia to sell its AI chips to China because the U.S. company will not be giving over its best technology. Lutnick made the remark speaking with CNBC's Brian Sullivan, saying that Nvidia wants to sell China its "fourth best" chip, which is slower than the fastest chips that U.S. companies use. Nvidia said Monday night that it would soon resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration signaled that it would grant the chipmaker necessary export licenses. Lutnick said that the administration said that the renewed sale of H20 chips to China was linked to a rare earths magnet deal. He said it was in U.S. interests to have Chinese companies using American technology so they continue to use an American "tech stack." "The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it," Lutnick said. "We want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology stack, because they still rely upon it." Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said in recent weeks that the U.S. should continue selling his chips to China so Chinese companies don't invest in homegrown infrastructure. Huang on Sunday also said that the Chinese military wouldn't use Nvidia chips anyway, and previously signaled that China's Huawei is a legitimate competitor. "You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips." The reversal is a major win for Nvidia. Nvidia said it could have sold $8 billion in H20 chips in the current quarter before sales were stopped. The administration reversed its decision after President Donald Trump met with Huang in Washington last week. "You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack," Lutnick said. It's based on the same underlying technology as Nvidia's Hopper-generation chips, which are sold in the U.S. as finished systems using H100 or H200 chips. The U.S. chipmaker took some features out of the H20 in order to sell it to China, including fewer graphics processing unit cores and lower bandwidth connecting separate parts of the chip. Nvidia says that it releases new artificial intelligence chips every year and that serious AI developers should always try to get the latest and greatest versions because the technology is improving so quickly. The best AI chips broadly available from clouds and system makers today are called Blackwell, and come as a GB200 chip with a paired central processing unit as well as B100 and B200 versions. Nvidia also makes a range of Blackwell-based chips for gaming and graphics that can be used for AI, but they're generally weaker than the biggest chips designed for data centers. A successor, called Blackwell Ultra, is only now starting to be installed in data centers, and it's expected to ramp in volume over the next year. In 2027, Nvidia will release "Vera Rubin" chips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday as worries over U.S. inflation and a mixed bag of big bank earnings dragged the blue-chip index lower. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a boost from gains in Nvidia. The The Nasdaq jumped 0.5%, lifted by a more than 4% rise in Nvidia shares after the chip company said it hopes to "soon" resume deliveries of its H20 GPU sales to China. June inflation data released Tuesday represented an increase from May levels, despite the headline numbers matching expectations. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew 0.2% month over month, slightly less than expected. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1. "The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy. "While there was a mild miss in the core number, both the main and underlying inflation measures are now printing at their highest levels in four months. The big fear for Fed officials is that stormier waters lie ahead, as not only is there a time lag between the tariffs and an increase to prices, but additional tariff hikes on 1st August would almost certainly herald further inflationary pressures ahead," Ryan added. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report coming in-line with expectations, but that "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming." On the earnings front, reports from several financial heavyweights failed to impress investors. Wells Fargo beat earnings, but a reduction in net interest income guidance sent shares lower by more than 4%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged lower even though the bank posted better-than-expected second-quarter results driven by strong trading and investment banking revenue. Asset manager BlackRock slipped more than 6% on a quarterly revenue miss. Wall Street is hoping that the second-quarter earnings season will boost a stock market that's already near all-time highs. Expectations are low ahead of the reports, however. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. While Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally remains optimistic that the Trump administration will come to a negotiated tariff deal that will be a positive for automakers, he is cautious on Tesla. "We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL," he wrote, citing several factors for his concern. McNally said "long-term negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated," with fiscal 2026 earnings per share on pace to be about 85% lower than 2022 predictions. He's also worried about a disappointing autonomous vehicle rollout, "divisive political posting," and technical moves in the stock that are on the edge of turning negative. Tesla stock has fallen more than 21% year to date, but was slightly positive in Tuesday's session. In the near term, McNally said he is expecting second-quarter profits in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents per share, which is below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 44 cents. The S&P 500 has posted 55 days above its 20-day moving average, the longest such streak going back to January 2021 when it was 56 days, according to BTIG. The 20-day moving average, which indicates short-term trends, is at around 6,144. The long streak is a bullish long-term signal for the stock market, suggesting the S&P 500 can continue to climb higher now that it's back to trading around all-time highs. "We are clearly stretching the limits of time without a 20 DMA break, and former such streaks often led to periods of volatility or consolidation," BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky wrote Monday. "We think at a minimum we see a test of ~6144 as we head into the back-half of July as volatility enters a a seasonally strong period, and likely something closer to the 6k level heading into August," he added. Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials jumped more than 25% Tuesday on a $500 million deal to supply Apple with magnets that are manufactured at a plant in Texas. MP will provide Apple with rare earth magnets made from recycled materials at its Independence plant in Forth Worth. President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his demand for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, following an inflation report that showed prices rising but mostly in line with market expectations. Trump posted on his Truth Social site. One Trillion Dollars a year would be saved!!!" Core inflation also moved higher, rising 0.2%, with a 2.9% annual rate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher by 25 points, or less than 0.1%. Shares of Citigroup rose modestly in premarket trading after second-quarter results topped Wall Street expectations. Here's how Citigroup's results compare to Wall Street expectations: Read the full list of stocks moving here. Inflation rose as expected for June, with the consumer price index advancing 2.7% year over year and 0.3% month over month. So-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, grew by 0.2% for the month. Factory activity in the New York area surged in July, posting its first positive reading since February as shipments, inventory and employment grew and optimism for the future also improved, according to the regional Federal Reserve Announcements from a handful of major tech companies on Tuesday spurred enthusiasm around AI stocks, lifting the broader market higher in premarket trading. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.8% in the premarket after the company lowered its 2025 net income guidance to roughly in line with 2024 levels. The bank previously expected an increase of 1% to 3%. The forecast reduction overshadowed better-than-expected second-quarter results. Investment banking and trading revenue drove the stronger-than-expected numbers. Shares of Nvidia jumped 4.5% in premarket trade on Tuesday, after the company said it was hopeful it could soon resume sales of its H20 chips to China. "The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 1.6% to close at 24,590.12, while mainland China's CSI 300 index was flat at 4,019.06. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi index increased by 0.41% to close at 3,215.28, while the small-cap Kosdaq advanced 1.69% to 812.88. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 benchmark ended the day 0.7% higher at 8,630.30. Over in India, the 50-stock benchmark Nifty 50 was up 0.43%, while the Sensex index moved up 0.31% as of 1.55 p.m. Indian Standard time (4.25 a.m. We're just over half an hour into Tuesday's trading session, and European shares are broadly moving higher. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen trading around 0.2% higher, with most sectors trading in positive territory. Regional shares are coming off of a mostly losing session on Monday, as investors reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to to slap 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union next month. The inflation reading is due out Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. Companies have a low bar to clear this earnings season. The S&P 500 is projected to post a blended earnings growth rate of 4.3% in the second quarter, on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet data. Advertising tech company The Trade Desk will become part of the S&P 500, effective before trading opens on Friday, July 18, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Just last week, Wall Street firm Stephens predicted that The Trade Desk could be a potential contender to join the S&P 500's communications services sector, which is an underweight grouping in the index. The Trade Desk will replace software company Ansys, which is on track to be acquired by Synopsys on or about Thursday. U.S. stock futures opened little changed Monday night.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 2024 report commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy found that data centers â€” the backbone of artificial intelligence â€” already accounted for more than 4% of U.S. electricity use, and the report said that could grow to 12% by 2028. That would be 580 billion kilowatt hours, or nearly 20 times the annual power consumption of the city of Chicago. "Data centers run 24/7, and need to be able to support the needs of our users," said Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers for Meta. The parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp has announced a massive push into AI. Meta is not alone, say economic development experts. "The big issues right now are deliverability of sites," said Tom Stringer, a principal and leader of the site selection and incentives practice at Grassi Advisors in New York. "And maybe the biggest component of that is adequate power." On Tuesday, Google announced it would spend $25 billion to develop data centers along the nation's largest multi-state grid, an electricity region covering 13 states in all. CoreWeave announced a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. CNBC considers each state's electrical grid in our annual competitiveness study, America's Top States for Business. Under the study's methodology, we use U.S. Department of Energy data on grid reliability â€” the duration of power outages per year â€” as well as the retail price of electricity. With a wealth of inexpensive, reliable electricity, these states are the best equipped to power the AI revolution, and everything else. New Mexico is the seventh largest generator of wind energy, according to the Energy Department, and it is seeking to increase the use of other alternative sources like solar power to meet relentless demand. The state is also seeking to modernize its grid with tools like smart meters that will help the state better coordinate supply and demand. Largest electric utility: Public Service Company of New Mexico North Dakotans enjoy the cheapest electricity of any state â€” roughly 30% cheaper than in neighboring Minnesota. One reason, the U.S. Department of Energy says, is that the state has abundant supplies of coal and natural gas, and a small population. That allows the state to produce far more energy than it consumes. In all, North Dakota generates about one-third of its power from renewable sources, and efforts are underway to increase that. EmPower North Dakota, an agency created by the state legislature in 2007, aims to diversify the state's grid beyond fossil fuels. The roughly 1-million-square-foot facility is expected to begin operations next year. To fulfill Meta's promise that the center will run on 100% renewable energy, the company is helping to develop a 200-megawatt solar facility nearby. But Idaho is also rich in other renewable sources, most notably hydroelectric power. South Dakota is meeting the voracious demand for energy with a heavy reliance on renewables â€” especially wind, which accounts for 55% of the state's electricity generation, according to the Energy Department. The only state more reliant on wind is Iowa. The Energy Department notes that wind power surpassed hydropower in South Dakota for the first time in 2021. While coal still accounts for nearly half of Utah's electricity generation, that is down sharply from 75% a decade ago, according to the Energy Department. The Utah Office of Energy Development says its Strategic Energy Plan differs from energy policies in many other states because it prioritizes the human consequences of its actions. "While other states enact energy policies focused on energy resources and emissions, Utah is focused on ensuring our citizens maintain their standard of living and have the chance to thrive," the office's website says. Largest electric utility: Rocky Mountain Power â€“ a division of Berkshire Hathaway's PacifiCorp Wyoming is coal country â€” home to about one-third of the nation's recoverable coal reserves, according to the Energy Department. So, it should come as no surprise that coal-fired power plants produce around three-quarters of Wyoming's electricity, more than any state except West Virginia. Since then, coal's decline as a preferred energy source nationwide has profoundly affected Wyoming's economy. Still, with the smallest population of any state, and all that coal â€” plus abundant wind, hydroelectric, natural gas and solar power â€” Wyoming produces far more power than it consumes. That makes for very low costs on a reliable grid. Largest electric utility: Rocky Mountain Power â€“ a division of Berkshire Hathaway's PacifiCorp No state gets more of its electricity from wind than Iowa, according to the Energy Department, which says Iowa's power mix has changed rapidly over the past decade or so. Coal, which was dominant until around 2019, now accounts for less than a quarter of the state's electricity production. Largest electric utility: MidAmerican Energy (Berkshire Hathaway) Nebraska offers America's most reliable power grid, at among the lowest cost. The Energy Department says Nebraska is the only state in which all electricity providers are owned by the public â€” either through public power districts, municipal power systems, or rural electric cooperatives.

Gold:

Barrick Mining Corp. is in advanced talks to sell its last Canadian gold mine to Discovery Silver Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, as the firms seek to capitalize on the soaring price of the precious metal. 

Discovery Silver is in the final stages of a process Barrick launched in April to sell the Hemlo gold mine in Ontario, the people said, who asked not to be named. There's no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Barack Obama ripped Big Law firms for caving to the Trump administration just to protect their careers and fund their lavish lifestyles. Obama was speaking at a private fundraiser in New Jersey on Friday when he expressed disappointment at how some of the country's top law firms had "set aside the law" in the face of President Donald Trump's attacks. Obama said some lawyers were giving way to Trump not because they were "going to be thrown in jail, but because they might lose a few clients and might not be able to finish that kitchen rehab at their Hampton house." "I'm not impressed," Obama said, per remarks obtained by MSNBC. After his first year of law school, the former president worked as a summer associate at Sidley & Austin. Before entering politics, Obama worked as a civil rights attorney at the litigation firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. Since February, Trump has issued executive orders targeting Big Law firms like Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling. He also ordered reviews of each firm's contracts with the government. Some law firms, such as Paul Weiss and Kirkland & Ellis, struck deals with Trump and promised to do pro bono legal work for conservative causes. In his remarks, Obama took aim at universities that chose to find room for compromise with Trump. "If your core mission, if your core value is to teach, you may teach without compromising values of academic independence. That's why you have those big endowments," Obama said on Friday. Obama has continued to be a vocal critic of Trump and his administration. "We're not there yet completely, but I think that we are dangerously close to normalizing behavior like that," Obama said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is staring down a long-term economic threat that could outlast both the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions: a deepening demographic crisis. On Tuesday, Labor Minister Anton Kotyakov underscored the scale of the problem during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Kotyakov said the number is required to replace 10.1 million people who will reach retirement age, and 800,000 new jobs. Kotyakov warned that if productivity growth falls short of the assumptions built into the current forecast, there could be "an additional shortage of personnel." The remarks came during a Kremlin meeting focused on demographics and healthcare. Members of Putin's cabinet discussed efforts to boost birth rates, including financial incentives like cash payouts and tax breaks for large families. Putin has made population growth a national priority, calling it a matter of "ethnic survival" and encouraging women to have as many as eight children. The country's population was about 146 million last year. But boosting birth rates isn't Russia's only challenge. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated labor shortages, with battlefield injuries and deaths cutting into the working-age population and a brain drain pulling younger, educated professionals out of the country. The labor shortage has driven up wages and fueled inflation, adding strain to an economy already distorted by wartime spending. Just last month, Russia's economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, warned that the country was "on the brink" of a recession.</p>
