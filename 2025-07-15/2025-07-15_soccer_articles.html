                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The English Premier League power stunned observers in Sunday's final by rolling past Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, an upset to cap off the first edition of a massively expanded tournament. President Trump — who spent plenty of time ahead of the event bonding with FIFA head Gianni Infantino — made his presence known after the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., taking the field to boos before lingering among Chelsea players in an awkward trophy ceremony. Here's what President Trump said about the Club World Cup trophy: On Sunday, Club World Cup broadcaster DAZN conducted an interview with President Trump, who declared that he was told by FIFA that the trophy originally unveiled at the White House back in March could remain there in perpetuity. "I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' claimed Trump, before stating that FIFA officials replied, "'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now." FIFA had not previously announced plans to make a second Club World Cup trophy, while Chelsea's official Instagram page included a photo of airplane pilots holding the trophy — replica or not — before the team departed for London. It has been present for some soccer-related moments, like a bizarre event where the president offered his take on world affairs while confused-looking Juventus players stood in the background.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump stood on stage for the FIFA Club World Cup trophy presentation after Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain, 3-0, in Sunday's final. Chelsea lifted a replica trophy during the FIFA Club World Cup awards ceremony, according to news sources. The original 24-carat gold-plated gyroscope-like trophy designed designed by FIFA and crafted by Tiffany & Co was presented to Trump by FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a ceremony at the Oval Office. In an interview with DAZN, the president explained that the original trophy was a gift from FIFA and that Chelsea F.C. "They (FIFA) said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and (FIFA President Gianni Infantino) said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office'," Trump said. Adding, “And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now (the original) is in the Oval.” In a viral video from Sunday's award ceremony, Trump is seen tucking a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal in his pocket after all the others were handed out to the winning Chelsea team members. However, according to news reports, Trump has claimed that the trophy was a gift from FIFA president Gianni Infantino and is being kept in the Oval Office at the White House. There is no official confirmation of the original trophy's whereabouts at this time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aware of its global impact and the success of the first Club World Cup, Real Madrid made a bold suggestion to FIFA: that the tournament be held every two years. Initially, the competition will be held every four seasons. The next one is scheduled for 2029, but still without a defined venue - Brazil has already positioned itself as a possibility. FIFA, in turn, would only consider increasing the number of participating clubs: from 32 to 48. But there was plenty of success off the field. Real wants a World Cup every two years even if it is not guaranteed in the next one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For fans in North Texas willing to head a bit farther away, NRG Stadium in Houston will host seven matches. The tournament starts on Thursday, June 11, with matches in Mexico City and Guadalajara. The first game in Arlington will be on Sunday, June 14. According to a news release Tuesday morning, FIFA will release the tickets in phases, due to anticipated high demand. Fans can apply to win the chance to buy tickets in the first draw starting on Sept. 10, FIFA said. "There will be several distinct ticket sales phases from the start of sales on 10 September 2025, through to the final match on Sunday, 19 July 2026. Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products, and full details on each phase will be released in the coming months," the news release said. "This registration of interest ensures they are made aware of ticketing dates, next steps and processes," FIFA said. Anyone attending a World Cup game in Arlington will technically have tickets to Dallas Stadium, as World Cup venues are not allowed to use names of their corporate sponsors. "It's not a dig against Dallas," Ross said. "It's just essential pride of the city of Arlington and what we have accomplished here in our entertainment district ... The Dallas Sports Commission has told Arlington leaders that it will address the issue with FIFA this summer. Steven Rosenbaum is a digital producer for CBS Texas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is in the books, but even as the dust settles after Chelsea's rout of Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final at MetLife Stadium, preparations for next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup -- hosted across the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19 -- are already well underway. ESPN's reporters who covered the 2025 summer tournament weigh in on the glaring needs FIFA can't afford to ignore if next summer's showpiece sporting event is to be one of its best. Manchester City played their first group game at noon in Philadelphia, with no sun coverage, and their second at 9 p.m. in Atlanta's air-conditioned stadium. Afterward, Pep Guardiola talked about the matches as if his team had played two different sports. The issue ahead of the 2026 World Cup is that some teams will have to play in early afternoon matches in places like Miami, where temperatures will reach 90 degrees and higher. With so many games to fit in, there's no other way around it. England's chances of lifting the trophy will be boosted immeasurably if they play most of their games in covered stadiums like the ones in Atlanta or Houston. On the flip side, if Thomas Tuchel's side are asked to play at lunchtime in Miami, they're going to struggle. Think Brazil in 2014, when England finished bottom of their group and went home early. But with wildly different conditions in different stadiums and venues, it needs to do everything it can to make the tournament as fair as possible. Most World Cups have taken place during summer in the Northern hemisphere, which makes a bit of heat and humidity par for the course. However, throw in North America's thunderstorms -- which delay games -- and the impact of the weather is going to be potentially next-level. This is where, off the back of the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA needs to be clever in terms of both venues and kickoff times. With four games each day from June 13-23 and a whopping eight (in four slots) from June 24-26, it won't be straightforward. But FIFA has several cards to play if it is willing to learn from 2025 and not get overly hung up on kickoff times. It seems obvious that if you are going to play in the middle of the day, you should do it in those cities, wherever possible. Maybe at the Club World Cup, there was a desire to put big clubs in the European prime time to boost TV audiences. Well, FIFA doesn't need to do this for the World Cup because unlike its little sibling, there's no proof of concept needed. The system works (with glitches), but it will come under immense strain next summer when the U.S., Mexico and Canada welcome fans for a 48-team World Cup. I personally had three internal flights during the Club World Cup, and they were delayed by three hours, 11 hours and one hour. There will be some delays that cause fans to miss games. Some stadiums are also way out of town, the Hard Rock in Miami being an example of a ground that is really only accessible by car. For U.S. sports fans who regularly visit some of these stadiums -- whether it's New Jersey's MetLife, Miami's Hard Rock or Pasadena's Rose Bowl -- it goes without saying that arriving and departing is often a long and painful process requiring plenty of patience, planning, and above all, time. Ask anyone who has attended several games at this tournament and they'll have their own "journey from hell" anecdote. At the Rose Bowl -- which isn't one of the World Cup venues, instead being replaced by Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium -- a number of journalists, including those with international news agencies, arrived at close to halftime in the stadium's debut match, PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, after getting caught up in traffic jams. At Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, driving or catching an Uber is no guarantee of arriving before kickoff. The stadium's security perimeter -- set up to prevent a repeat of last summer's Copa America chaos -- is so extensive that a long, sweaty walk in Florida's heat and humidity is required anyway to get to your gate. Even the buses provided by FIFA for journalists -- which worked well at most venues, and really should be the blueprint for an expanded program that caters to fans with tickets in 2026 -- suffered long delays after getting stuck in traffic. MetLife's location in East Rutherford has long been a bone of contention for New Yorkers. Get caught in rush-hour traffic and the journey by road from Manhattan can literally take hours. And yes, NJ Transit runs a special train service for events, with the station close to the stadium, but that still involves a change -- and sometimes a long wait -- at nearby Secaucus Junction. But the lack of adequate public transport infrastructure, coupled with some out-of-town locations, for a number of these venues is going to cause a major headache in 2026 unless FIFA provides additional, free shuttle buses running frequently for fans. PSG coach Luis Enrique said Seattle's Lumen Field resembled an "NBA court full of holes" before doubling down by adding that the "ball bounces like a rabbit." Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham said the pitches in general "aren't great at all ... [and] tough on the knees as well. Hopefully someone will look at that going into the World Cup next year." After all, this wave of frustration follows on from criticism of the surfaces used during last year's Copa America, including Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez labelling the Mercedes-Benz Stadium pitch in Atlanta a "disaster." Five of the venues used at the Club World Cup -- Lumen Field, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field -- will be employed at next summer's World Cup, and there is clearly work still to be done. They are NFL stadiums using artificial turf, incompatible with FIFA's requirement that all its competitions are played on entirely natural grass surfaces. The Club World Cup was an experiment in that regard, as FIFA tried to innovate new techniques to create a hybrid surface, including transporting Bermuda grass overnight in refrigerated trucks to improve the quality. Furthermore, while many participants complained about the extreme temperatures, stadiums with roofs make it harder to grow and maintain real grass with natural sunlight. Four of the 16 venues next summer -- Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver -- have roofs. "We'll report after this tournament and take lessons forward to 2026," said MetLife pitch venue manager Blair Christensen at the tournament's conclusion. "These guys here that work on the pitch with me, they are far sharper and better than they were 35 days ago, and we'll take that forward to next year." Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup. The 2025 Club World Cup saw 32 teams from around the globe participate in an extensive competition under extreme conditions, facing intense heat, logging thousands of miles in travel across the United States between games and playing on makeshift pitches to replace artificial grass in certain venues. While Major League Soccer players entered the competition amid the ongoing 2025 campaign, and with fresher legs given that their offseason runs from early December to late February, most clubs were forced to play just weeks after grueling campaigns: all four Brazilian teams (Flamengo, Palmeiras, Fluminense, Botafogo) had played 70 or more games, with Chelsea and Manchester City clocking in with 57 across all competitions. Exhaustion often showed in the performances, leading to forced substitutions, concern for injuries and, at times, an arguably less intense level of football on the pitch. It's not over for these players either, with MLS clubs returning to their regular season and European clubs preparing for the 2025-26 campaign. With just one year until the 2026 World Cup, players and clubs missed out on a crucial summer break, and they must now balance avoiding injuries and playing time while still being competitive, with players keen to earn a spot in their national team's roster. Once participating players kick off the 2025-26 campaign and weekly action is underway, players might begin to experience the Club World Cup's lasting impact.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is in the books, but even as the dust settles after Chelsea's rout of Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final at MetLife Stadium, preparations for next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup -- hosted across the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19 -- are already well underway. ESPN's reporters who covered the 2025 summer tournament weigh in on the glaring needs FIFA can't afford to ignore if next summer's showpiece sporting event is to be one of its best. Manchester City played their first group game at noon in Philadelphia, with no sun coverage, and their second at 9 p.m. in Atlanta's air-conditioned stadium. Afterward, Pep Guardiola talked about the matches as if his team had played two different sports. The issue ahead of the 2026 World Cup is that some teams will have to play in early afternoon matches in places like Miami, where temperatures will reach 90 degrees and higher. With so many games to fit in, there's no other way around it. England's chances of lifting the trophy will be boosted immeasurably if they play most of their games in covered stadiums like the ones in Atlanta or Houston. On the flip side, if Thomas Tuchel's side are asked to play at lunchtime in Miami, they're going to struggle. Think Brazil in 2014, when England finished bottom of their group and went home early. But with wildly different conditions in different stadiums and venues, it needs to do everything it can to make the tournament as fair as possible. Most World Cups have taken place during summer in the Northern hemisphere, which makes a bit of heat and humidity par for the course. However, throw in North America's thunderstorms -- which delay games -- and the impact of the weather is going to be potentially next-level. This is where, off the back of the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA needs to be clever in terms of both venues and kickoff times. With four games each day from June 13-23 and a whopping eight (in four slots) from June 24-26, it won't be straightforward. But FIFA has several cards to play if it is willing to learn from 2025 and not get overly hung up on kickoff times. It seems obvious that if you are going to play in the middle of the day, you should do it in those cities, wherever possible. Maybe at the Club World Cup, there was a desire to put big clubs in the European prime time to boost TV audiences. Well, FIFA doesn't need to do this for the World Cup because unlike its little sibling, there's no proof of concept needed. The system works (with glitches), but it will come under immense strain next summer when the U.S., Mexico and Canada welcome fans for a 48-team World Cup. I personally had three internal flights during the Club World Cup, and they were delayed by three hours, 11 hours and one hour. There will be some delays that cause fans to miss games. Some stadiums are also way out of town, the Hard Rock in Miami being an example of a ground that is really only accessible by car. For U.S. sports fans who regularly visit some of these stadiums -- whether it's New Jersey's MetLife, Miami's Hard Rock or Pasadena's Rose Bowl -- it goes without saying that arriving and departing is often a long and painful process requiring plenty of patience, planning, and above all, time. Ask anyone who has attended several games at this tournament and they'll have their own "journey from hell" anecdote. At the Rose Bowl -- which isn't one of the World Cup venues, instead being replaced by Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium -- a number of journalists, including those with international news agencies, arrived at close to halftime in the stadium's debut match, PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, after getting caught up in traffic jams. At Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, driving or catching an Uber is no guarantee of arriving before kickoff. The stadium's security perimeter -- set up to prevent a repeat of last summer's Copa America chaos -- is so extensive that a long, sweaty walk in Florida's heat and humidity is required anyway to get to your gate. Even the buses provided by FIFA for journalists -- which worked well at most venues, and really should be the blueprint for an expanded program that caters to fans with tickets in 2026 -- suffered long delays after getting stuck in traffic. MetLife's location in East Rutherford has long been a bone of contention for New Yorkers. Get caught in rush-hour traffic and the journey by road from Manhattan can literally take hours. And yes, NJ Transit runs a special train service for events, with the station close to the stadium, but that still involves a change -- and sometimes a long wait -- at nearby Secaucus Junction. But the lack of adequate public transport infrastructure, coupled with some out-of-town locations, for a number of these venues is going to cause a major headache in 2026 unless FIFA provides additional, free shuttle buses running frequently for fans. PSG coach Luis Enrique said Seattle's Lumen Field resembled an "NBA court full of holes" before doubling down by adding that the "ball bounces like a rabbit." Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham said the pitches in general "aren't great at all ... [and] tough on the knees as well. Hopefully someone will look at that going into the World Cup next year." After all, this wave of frustration follows on from criticism of the surfaces used during last year's Copa America, including Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez labelling the Mercedes-Benz Stadium pitch in Atlanta a "disaster." Five of the venues used at the Club World Cup -- Lumen Field, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field -- will be employed at next summer's World Cup, and there is clearly work still to be done. They are NFL stadiums using artificial turf, incompatible with FIFA's requirement that all its competitions are played on entirely natural grass surfaces. The Club World Cup was an experiment in that regard, as FIFA tried to innovate new techniques to create a hybrid surface, including transporting Bermuda grass overnight in refrigerated trucks to improve the quality. Furthermore, while many participants complained about the extreme temperatures, stadiums with roofs make it harder to grow and maintain real grass with natural sunlight. Four of the 16 venues next summer -- Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver -- have roofs. "We'll report after this tournament and take lessons forward to 2026," said MetLife pitch venue manager Blair Christensen at the tournament's conclusion. "These guys here that work on the pitch with me, they are far sharper and better than they were 35 days ago, and we'll take that forward to next year." Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup. The 2025 Club World Cup saw 32 teams from around the globe participate in an extensive competition under extreme conditions, facing intense heat, logging thousands of miles in travel across the United States between games and playing on makeshift pitches to replace artificial grass in certain venues. While Major League Soccer players entered the competition amid the ongoing 2025 campaign, and with fresher legs given that their offseason runs from early December to late February, most clubs were forced to play just weeks after grueling campaigns: all four Brazilian teams (Flamengo, Palmeiras, Fluminense, Botafogo) had played 70 or more games, with Chelsea and Manchester City clocking in with 57 across all competitions. Exhaustion often showed in the performances, leading to forced substitutions, concern for injuries and, at times, an arguably less intense level of football on the pitch. It's not over for these players either, with MLS clubs returning to their regular season and European clubs preparing for the 2025-26 campaign. With just one year until the 2026 World Cup, players and clubs missed out on a crucial summer break, and they must now balance avoiding injuries and playing time while still being competitive, with players keen to earn a spot in their national team's roster. Once participating players kick off the 2025-26 campaign and weekly action is underway, players might begin to experience the Club World Cup's lasting impact.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, according to Trump himself, James and his teammates were celebrating with a replica, rather than the real thing. During his shameless promotion tour of the newly expanded competition's inaugural outing, Infantino spent plenty of time buttering up the host nation's president. The trophy's first outing was in the White House's Oval Office back in March, an occasion which saw Trump hail Infantino as “the king of soccer, I guess, in a certain way”. Infantino may be the king, but Trump always reserves top billing for himself. The real Club World Cup trophy made by Tiffany & Co. has remained at the White House since that event in March. “I said, When are you going to pick up the trophy? [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one,'” Trump told DAZN during the Club World Cup final. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.” This summer's Club World Cup acted as a forerunner to next summer's international men's World Cup which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. “It's about everybody getting together and a lot of love between countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea FC defeated PSG in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup tournament — which featured several games played in Philadelphia — but might that have been the last chance soccer fans here to see the world's greatest players? Philadelphia is set to be one of the host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but there is a very real chance that FIFA skips America altogether next year. According to ESPN, there have been enough complaints about the summertime heat across America to cause FIFA players, coaches and the FIFPRO worldwide soccer players' union that FIFA is considering relocating the 2026 World Cup from America. "We clearly believe that from a health and safety perspective, this (extreme heat) is something that must take priority over commercial interests with regards to the safety of the players," said FIFPRO spokesperson Alexander Bielefeld in comments included in ESPN's report. The debate on extreme heat is not happening in a vacuum. ESPN also noted that FIFPRO executives suggested canceling FIFA Club World Cup matches in Philadelphia due to the heat, as temperatures went beyond their threshold of 82.4 degrees on the WetBulb Globe Temperature gauge. According to WeatherSpark, the average temperature in Philadelphia for late June is around 87 degrees. However, a separate report indicates FIFA officials haven't yet decided to pull the 2026 World Cup from America. As it stands, Lincoln Financial Field in South Philadelphia is set to host six 2026 FIFA World Cup matches. Damon C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ex-Manchester United star Louis Saha has explained why Cristiano Ronaldo will “definitely want Lionel Messi to join him in Saudi Arabia”. Two eternal rivals with 13 Ballons d'Or between them once locked horns on a regular basis when competing on opposing sides of the fierce Clasico divide that exists between La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. They have headed their separate ways since then, with Ronaldo recently extending his record-breaking contract in the Middle East with Al-Nassr. Messi, meanwhile, is turning out for Inter Miami in MLS. He is yet to extend his deal there, despite having an option for 2026, and there has been talk of big-spending teams in the Saudi Pro League readying another approach for the Argentine GOAT. Saha believes that CR7 would like to see a deal done, with the Portuguese superstar's former Old Trafford team-mate telling BoyleSports - who offer the latest Champions League betting: “Will Cristiano Ronaldo want Lionel Messi to join him in Saudi Arabia? Cristiano will want more big players out there and it's starting to get very competitive, we have seen that in the Club World Cup. “The people in Saudi will want to continue making the league as big as they can. Ronaldo is a competitor and he wants to win, he hasn't won trophies like he would want out there. Al-Ahli are the team said to have an offer for Messi ready to go, with the World Cup winner having previously snubbed interest from that part of the world when deciding to go chasing the American dream in 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi is being backed to complete an emotional homecoming transfer to Newell's Old Boys, amid questions of his future at Inter Miami. Argentine GOAT Messi is yet to extend a contract in South Florida that is due to expire at the end of the 2025 MLS campaign. Inter Miami remain hopeful that a deal can be done there, but Messi is seeing moves elsewhere mooted. Teams in the Saudi Pro League are reportedly ready to reunite the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner with eternal rival and Al-Nassr talisman Cristiano Ronaldo. A return to where it all began is also being speculated on, with Messi having never shied away from the fact that he would like to make a competitive appearance for Newell's before the day comes to hang up record-breaking boots for the final time. Close friend and fellow world champion Angel Di Maria has made a similar move, with the veteran winger heading back to Rosario Central at 37 years of age. Claudio Tapia, who was present for Di Maria's unveiling in familiar surroundings, believes Messi could tread the same path. Argentine FA president Tapia told TNT Sports when asked if Messi will one day return to his homeland and bring a remarkable career full circle: "I hope so." Newell's boss Cristian Fabbiani has previously stated that he would like to bring Messi home on a four-month contract. Messi has offered little indication as to what his long-term future will hold, with the South American superstar currently enjoying a history-making run of form in MLS that has seen him bag a brace in five consecutive matches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It delivered showstopping games and some rank attendances. Its riches were fought for fiercely by clubs, who also fear “disaster” seasons ahead. Yes, it's fair to say the newly-expanded 2025 Club World Cup was a football tournament unlike any other. James Horncastle: I enjoyed seeing a relaxed Pep Guardiola playing on the beach with his Manchester City players. It needed to be cut like a Top Gun montage with some Kenny Loggins music. It was that video of Cole Palmer wobbling awkwardly on a scooter, through the crowds, pretty much unnoticed, in one of the world's biggest tourist spots, where there's a giant billboard with his image on it. I love his ability on the pitch, as showcased in the final, and I love his authenticity off it. Jordan Campbell: Thiago Silva channeling his inner Al Pacino. The Fluminense captain delivered a stirring speech to his team-mates about not leaving things for later as tomorrow is not promised. Mario Cortegana: From a purely footballing point of view, Al Hilal's victory against Manchester City. It was a very beautiful game, with a lot of drama, and left us with surely the biggest surprise of the tournament. It was also a warning of what Saudi football can or intends to do ahead of the World Cup they will host in 2034. I also really enjoyed being able to watch live and from so close (in Valdebebas they put us far away!) It is very different from what we were used to with Carlo Ancelotti since 2021. Felipe Cardenas: When Boca Juniors fans took over Miami and then turned Hard Rock Stadium into a modern version of La Bombonera. Jeff Rueter: For all of the atmosphere created by their fans, Boca Juniors left much to be desired with their onfield performance. That shouldn't tarnish the achievement of Auckland City, taking a point off of Boca to close the group stage. Mark Carey: Leaning into the Americanisms of this tournament, I found it funny that legendary boxing announcer Michael Buffer screamed: “Let's get ready to rumble!” ahead of both semi-finals and the final. Having each player enter the pitch individually in their own respective “ring walk” is one thing, but come on — that is too much. I found it entertaining, but not necessarily for the right reasons. One memory that will always stick with me was seeing — and smelling — the Brazilian barbecue tailgate parties that Flamengo fans had in the car parks outside Lincoln Financial Field before and after their win over Chelsea. FIFA will want to see more of that fusion of local and American culture at the World Cup next year. Asli Pelit: I loved watching a handful of beloved South American teams bring that unmistakable garra Sudamericana back to a sport increasingly warped by sovereign funds, private equity, and billionaire ownership. A handful of players from these clubs also reminded me that no matter how old a player is (nor how many times he's bounced between Europe's elite clubs) when they come back home to retire swiftly, there's still joy in the fight. Shout out to Thiago Silva for proving it's never just a farewell tour. They made me remember why I do this. Why I still love this game, even when so much of it feels lost. James Horncastle: When the Oval Office became a mixed zone and Donald Trump spoke about the Middle East and then turned and asked a bemused set of Juventus players: “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” A club nicknamed the Old Lady has rarely looked so uncomfortable amid stately locker-room talk. Jordan Campbell: The tears of Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves, Diogo Jota's best friend, as a minute's silence was held for the Liverpool forward. As the game started, both of them were visibly still trying to trick their brains into game mode, but how could they? Mark Carey: The pain of seeing current, and former, team-mates do their best to hold their emotions together during a moment's reflection for Diogo Jota is a memory that will not go away in a hurry. How they found the strength to think about kicking a football after recent events is beyond comprehension. Jeff Rueter: Gianni Infantino and Juventus' appearance at the White House was particularly catastrophic coming a day before the U.S.'s air strikes in Iran, with reporters posing questions about Trump's plans while Infantino watched on. Mind you, Iran qualified for the 2026 World Cup in March. For an organization that went to great lengths to keep politics away from the last instalment in Qatar, it was a flagrant instance of hypocrisy. Mario Cortegana: Real Madrid's painful semi-final defeat against PSG, in which the best thing for Los Blancos was the result (4-0). This thrashing has restored some worries inside and outside the team when it seemed that the arrival of Alonso had changed that. Liam Twomey: Sadly I fear this is doomed to become the defining image of Infantino's inaugural expanded FIFA Club World Cup: a beaming President Trump keeping himself front and centre of Chelsea's trophy lift at MetLife Stadium, generating the most emphatic visual riposte possible to the notion that sport can ever be kept separate from politics. I will say that seeing Jamal Musiala's leg break in person (even from a distance in the press tribune) was heartbreaking. In Qatar three years ago, Musiala was a 19-year-old phenom and arguably one of the tournament's best players. Asli Pelit: There is a creeping Americanization of football, no one asked for and no one needs, least of all at something like the Club World Cup which is supposedly happening to make casual fans love and understand the sport. We don't need player-by-player intros and we definitely don't need “Let's get ready to Rumble” echoing across a football pitch. The beauty of this sport is in its existing rituals, its global soul, not in theatrics borrowed from sports that stop every 10 seconds for commercials. It was a privilege to watch him play his last games for a European team before heading home to Rosario Central. Jordan Campbell: Since Fluminense winger Jhon Arias has gone from hipster to mainstream (and maybe Wolves) I shall avoid naming the Colombian. Ruben Neves' pinpoint passing and set-piece delivery was a joy to witness for Al Hilal, while Palmer is just so imaginative that he excites every time he gets on the ball. But, even after all these years, it was still Lionel Messi. Of course he has faded but there were very few players who proved they are clearly above him in his ability to dominate a game. Playing alongside players way below his level, he carried Inter Miami and even against PSG he had a dozen moments where he showed why his brain works differently to everyone else. But unlike Jordan, I'm not too cool to have been anything other than spellbound by Fluminense's Arias. I would love to see how he fares in Premier League if he does join Wolves, but I kind of love the fact that he's 27, at the peak of his powers, and still playing in South America. Mark Carey: I enjoyed Arda Guler dropping into a deeper role and dictating Real Madrid's build-up from deep. Guler has struggled for regular minutes since moving to Spain, but was billed as an heir to Luka Modric by Ancelotti before he left the club. Even for those of us who follow the Real Madrid academy, his emergence has been impressive. It's not normal for a kid from Castilla (Madrid's reserve team) who had only played 61 minutes this season under Ancelotti to have taken advantage of injuries to Kylian Mbappe and Endrick in this way, with four goals and an assist in six games. The best summary of his tournament is that Alonso compared him to club legend Raul. Jeff Rueter: Nottingham Forest fans should feel bullish about Igor Jesus's chances of acclimating to the Premier League. With Botafogo, the 24-year-old showed clever movement to pair with his immense physicality to win headers and create separation in the box. Having earned four caps for Brazil since debuting in October, he'll be determined to make the World Cup roster. Felipe Cardenas: I thought that none of us were going to pick Arias. His low center of gravity and apparent casual way of transporting the ball around the pitch is so impressive. However, I covered PSG multiple times during the tournament and came away as a fan of both Desire Doue and Bradley Barcola. Both players are street-ball type dribblers that any football fan would enjoy watching. Liam Twomey: No player made a bigger impact on the business end of this Club World Cup than Joao Pedro. The Brazilian was on holiday when Chelsea signed him from Brighton & Hove Albion during the mid-tournament player registration window, but his holidays are clearly nowhere near as indulgent as mine. He arrived in prime shape and immediately transformed Chelsea's attack, providing a clinical edge to Enzo Maresca's possession play with two brilliant goals in the semi-final win over Fluminense and one more in the final against PSG. Given the riches on offer at this tournament, he has already repaid his transfer fee. His football IQ and spatial understanding were remarkable. I don't know what happened to him at the final but until then, he was brilliant and a joy to watch. James Horncastle: I'd expect everyone to say Boca, and with good reason. World football is more poorly governed than before. Smash FIFA!” I'm going to go with the fans who actually turned up for the Mamelodi Sundowns-Ulsan game in Orlando. It is difficult to decide between them, Palmeiras and Botafogo but, from what I witnessed, Flamengo showed why they have the biggest fan base in Brazil. They turned out in swathes and organised themselves at games so that it felt like a domestic setting with blocks of red generating the best buzz of the live games I witnessed. An honourable mention must go to the estimated 15,000 Saudis who were in Orlando to see Al Hilal beat Manchester City as they were seriously boisterous. Oliver Kay: Urawa Red Diamonds' fans were amazing. They even did that wonderfully Japanese thing of cleaning up the terraces after themselves. They'd bought tickets for a knockout game there in anticipation of winning the group. Mark Carey: The Brazilian fans have had such rave reviews, and I agree. When Paulinho scored an extra-time winner against Botafogo? Felipe Cardenas: Supporters for every Brazilian club really showed out during the tournament. But still, Los Millonarios didn't make headlines with their traveling band of loyalists, but they were well supported in a part of the country that wasn't as accessible for their fans. Mario Cortegana: From what I have been able to experience live, those of Real Madrid. Several players actually expressed that it was almost like playing at home. From what I have seen and heard on television, I would highlight the Argentines, above all, and the Brazilians. For fans who made the trip to catch the field's lesser-followed clubs, like the Mamelodi Sundowns-Ulsan match as well as those of Auckland City, it seemed like an unforgettable chance to see their teams play on a global stage. Liam Twomey: Flamengo's supporters were the best I saw in person, both in terms of numbers and volume, and I was fortunate enough to see them twice. Asli Pelit: I spent most of the tournament with Fluminense and Palmeiras fans: pure passion, non-stop music, the kind of energy that makes you feel alive. But when it comes to sheer fandom, Boca fans in Miami and Los Millonarios out on the West Coast put everyone else to shame. You could feel it through the screen, even with DAZN's spotty coverage trying its best to ruin the vibe. James Horncastle: I enjoyed a lot of the football at this tournament. It wasn't played at a pre-season pace. Mamelodi-Borussia Dortmund was great fun and there were some good 0-0s, notably Sergio Ramos' Monterrey against River Plate, which was studs up and guards down; a Street Fighter arcade. The Saudi side refusing to kick off until the Venezuelan referee (called Valenzuela) checked the VAR monitor (he didn't), a goalkeeping clinic from Yassine Bounou, Malcom becoming the world-class player many believed he would for half an hour and, after a late extra-time winner, a major upset. Oliver Kay: The most enthralling game was Al Hilal's 4-3 victory over Manchester City, as others have said, but I also really enjoyed PSG's 2-0 win over Bayern in Atlanta. It was outstanding, lots of drama and high-quality performances on both sides. It wouldn't have looked out of place in the Champions League knock-out round — which, although Infantino won't like this, remains the gold standard for club football. Mark Carey: Not just because I was lucky to see the game live, but PSG's dismantling of Real Madrid was nothing short of the perfect performance. Luis Enrique's side made Madrid look like a European minnow, bagging three goals before we had reached half an hour. Jeff Rueter: Botafogo's 1-0 upset of PSG and Flamengo's ensuing 3-1 win over Chelsea provided this tournament with its proof of concept that teams from beyond Europe could spring surprises. Botafogo's win saw Renato Paiva concoct a bold scheme, defending with an aggressively advancing defensive line to limit PSG's space. And, in true “big club” fashion, Botafogo fired Paiva after a round of 16 exit. Felipe Cardenas: Aside from Musiala's horror injury, the PSG-Bayern clash was, as they say, a proper football match. Both sides were absolutely going for it, with the French champions admitting the day prior that revenge was on their minds. Before over 65,000 people in Atlanta, this European battle was tactical, attacking and full of dramatic moments. Liam Twomey: At the risk of being skewed by the matches I attended, I'll go for Bayern's 4-2 win over Flamengo in Miami. Filipe Luis' side played the best football of any non-European team at this tournament and after a horrendous opening 10 minutes they really turned the screws on Bayern, who were rescued ultimately by the clinical finishing of Harry Kane. I love a good underdog story in football. Monterrey vs Inter Milan was also a good one. Of course, it'll be better than this tournament. But it will also be disrupted, it'll be hot, expensive, knackering and the U.S. and its cities are so sprawling I think there will still be times when you ask yourself: is a major tournament going on here? In club football, established patterns of play means that players can adapt tactically to the conditions a little more, but internationally you are not afforded that same time to work on those ideas. Therefore, next summer could be quite an attritional tournament. I say that because while I think the football at the Club World Cup itself was a success, it just never seemed to be the centre of attention in any city. It didn't help that it was competing for attention with the Gold Cup, NFL, NBA and MLB but I'm not sure you can truly have a captive audience spread across three different countries. It could make the whole thing seem a little numbing next summer. It will be spread out across three countries, but I think it will really resonate in the host cities, with so many more fans arriving from overseas. There'll be more pressure on airlines and public transport, that is for sure. Mario Cortegana: There is plenty of room for improvement, though I have my doubts over how much will change. It is clear that the weather has been a very negative factor, as well as the quality of the grass (although I expected more serious injuries and thankfully there were few). Ticket sales, prices and the press facilities also left much to be desired. Jeff Rueter: More “business as usual” than spectacular. Don't get me wrong: a World Cup will always break away from the churn of the sport's routine, and there's no like-for-like comparison to be found against the Club World Cup. Still, there's a bit of big event fatigue settling in for ticket-buying fans, players, coaches and stadium staff. The cross-country travel, 48 teams and their supporters, an aviation industry that's understaffed and under fire will all become significant factors. I agree with James that this Club World Cup, while described as a 2026 dress rehearsal, cemented the fact that the U.S. still has work to do as the host of a major football tournament. Even in a Club World Cup group stage that sagged at times, the performances of the South American teams created some fun early intrigue. A 32-team tournament maintained some semblance of urgency; now imagine a format which requires an entire group stage to go from 48 to 32 teams. Asli Pelit: Here's my wish list for next year: More cooling stations around stadiums. If noon kickoffs are non-negotiable, then keeping fans hydrated and safe in 110-degree heat isn't optional. And while we're at it: simplify public transportation to the stadiums. James Horncastle: The participants will be late back, less rested and more injury-prone. People still haven't realised AFCON is in January and it clashes with the expanded Champions League. PSG aside, I wonder how many of the teams involved will win their domestic league. Jordan Campbell: From speaking to performance and fitness coaches in the Premier League a few months back, those not working at a club competing at this tournament have thanked their lucky stars. They believe it is a logistical nightmare as a three-to-four week gap either side of the tournament does not allow enough time for proper recovery and a full pre-season, meaning it is likely that some players will come in undercooked and take time to get going or could be overcooked and trail off, potentially due to injuries, as the season wears on. Oliver Kay: I honestly don't know yet because it's such an unknown. I felt pre-tournament that it could really undermine Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid etc, because no sports scientist would recommend the kind of summer they have had. Even if they battle on through to May, how many of these players will be in peak condition for the World Cup? I do not agree with FIFA flogging players with too many games at all, but I don't think this summer's tournament will have a tangible impact on the outcome of next season. If there were one thing, it should put more onus on managers rotating their squads a little at the start of the campaign, but otherwise I think its influence will be negligible. Mario Cortegana: Madrid, the Spanish club to go furthest, will have a three-week vacation, so I don't expect a big impact. I was expecting more in terms of injuries during the tournament, as it was stretching an already very demanding season by almost a month. I do think it could have more damage on clubs in leagues that start the competition earlier. Jeff Rueter: To Mark's point, I'm very curious if it will be remembered more than a few months from now. Given its branding, one would think this should be a major pillar of the 2025 calendar year. But will Ballon d'Or voters really give outsized considerations to performances in this Club World Cup? Or will this be treated as little more than the most lavish preseason tournament in history for European clubs? Liam Twomey: It's hard to imagine their Club World Cup exertions helping Chelsea from a physical perspective next season. They're going on holiday while all of their Premier League rivals build up the conditioning that is vital to sustain a 10-month campaign. Felipe Cardenas: Player welfare will remain a talking point and players, coaches, fans and pundits will refer to the Club World Cup as one reason the players may look fatigued in 2025-26. There were no other narratives to fall back on. It billed itself as ‘best vs best' and gave many a stick to beat it with after a 10-0 in the second game but the competitiveness of this tournament showed that there is a concept worth pursuing. If the Saudi Pro League can provide a few of the Asian representatives in 2029 there should be a third pole capable of competing. Oliver Kay: See revenue distributed in a way that genuinely benefits the game, rather than just the richest clubs in each region. And yet more than $300million of an (absurd) $1billion prize fund will be split between Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. If Infantino genuinely thinks this helps football's financial inequalities, rather than compounds them, then he hasn't learned much from his time at UEFA. Mario Cortegana: Selling this tournament as if everything has been rosy may have felt necessary to FIFA for the first edition, but for the next one I hope they leave that a little behind. Jeff Rueter: Have some sense about kick-off slots. Mid-afternoon games in the American summer looked unnecessarily gruelling. With apologies to my friends in Europe who could catch games in primetime, it did a disservice to players and fans alike. But maybe the place to start is simply asking players and fans: do they even want this tournament to continue? Before expanding formats and squeezing in more fixtures, maybe ask whether we actually need yet another tournament. Liam Twomey: Make player welfare a bigger consideration than maximising viewer numbers. Felipe Cardenas: Never use Freed from Desire as the tournament's soundtrack ever again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is understood Fifpro was not invited to a meeting regarding player welfare held by Infantino in New York on the eve of the final, won 3-0 by Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain. Marchi said the Club World Cup was not without its strengths because it had “generated enthusiasm among numerous fans and allowed some of the world's leading figures to be seen in a single tournament”, but he said it did not represent football well. “Fifpro cannot fail to point out, with absolute clarity, that this competition hides a dangerous disconnect with the true reality experienced by most footballers around the world,” he said. “What was presented as a global celebration of football was nothing more than a fiction created by Fifa, promoted by its president, without dialogue, sensitivity and respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts. Those “true protagonists” are the players, including those of Chelsea and PSG who will start their new league seasons five weeks after the final. Last month Fifpro urged Fifa to grant players a four-week rest between seasons. This request has not been taken up, however, with the meeting on Saturday ending with an agreement that three weeks of rest would be sufficient. “There is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period/holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season,” Fifa said. Fifpro is part of a group of football bodies, including the Premier League, pursuing legal action against Fifa over an alleged lack of consultation regarding the Club World Cup and changes to the international match calendar more broadly. FifaThe global governing body has said it is “fully within our rights to set the parameters of our competitions whilst respecting the regulatory framework in place”, and the prospect of a legal row was described by Infantino as “futile”.</p>
