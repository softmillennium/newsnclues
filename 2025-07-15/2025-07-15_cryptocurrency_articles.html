                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) railed against House leadership Tuesday for allegedly blocking efforts to amend the GENIUS Act, a crypto-friendly bill that would establish a regulatory framework for digital currencies. Taken up for a procedural vote in the House on Tuesday, the GENIUS Act failed to advance in a vote of 196-222, with critics like Greene accosting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for apparently not accepting amendments to the bill. Her largest grievance, Greene said, was the omission of a ban on the federal government developing a Central Bank Digital Currency, something President Donald Trump banned in January via executive order. Greene and other Trump allies have long opposed the establishment of a central bank digital currency out of fear of government overreach, with opposition to the federal government dipping its toes in cryptocurrency becoming a rallying cry for the MAGA faithful. While she went on to pledge support for the bill when it eventually returns for a vote, Greene urged House leadership to allow a ban on establishing such a currency to move forward, and warned of the potential repercussions should her and her allies' efforts be stonewalled. “Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency,” Greene wrote Tuesday in a social media post on X. “Republicans have a duty to ban CBDC. President Trump included a ban on CBDC in his January 23rd executive order and Congress must also include the ban on CBDC in the GENIUS Act.” ALSO READ: Fury at ICE sees Americans funnel millions of dollars to help detainees Copyright © 2025 Raw Story Media, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins This resurgence is particularly notable as Ethereum has surged past the $3,000 mark, breaking out of a six-year consolidation phase. The total crypto market cap has jumped, as investors rotate into altcoins, especially those with strong staking mechanics like Ethereum. This shift in capital from Bitcoin to altcoins indicates that the market may be entering an altcoin season, where altcoins outperform Bitcoin. This is supported by a rare bullish crossover on Ethereum's moving averages, typically seen during major rallies, potentially signaling the end of the crypto winter. The market is in the early stages of altcoin season, with key indicators flashing breakout signals and market momentum rising. This is evident in the performance of veteran altcoins, which have shown impressive gains. Stellar (XLM), ranked 12th by market cap, has a weekly gain of 82%, leading among similar assets. ADA, ranked 10th by market cap, has a weekly gain of nearly 30%; Ripple (XRP) 29%; Dogecoin (DOGE) 18%. Some newer altcoins, such as the L1 project Sei (SEI) and the synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA), have also shown impressive gains, with weekly increases exceeding 30%. This suggests that the altcoin market may no longer be merely speculative frenzy but rather driven by fundamentals and institutional funding for more sustainable growth. However, the index has recently shown a positive upward trend, suggesting that early signs of rotation are emerging. Key signals for the arrival of altcoin season include strengthening dominance of altcoins, rapid price increases, and FOMO sentiment and retail frenzy. The decline in Bitcoin dominance is an important feature of the current market, with altcoins beginning to perform widely, indicating that institutional and retail investors may be diversifying their funds into alternative digital assets. The launch of spot ETFs, advances in Layer 2 (L2) solutions, the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, the development of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and the improvement of blockchain gaming infrastructure have all brought new value narratives and application prospects to altcoins, providing fundamental support. This follows Bitcoin's rapid pullback from its all-time high of over $123,000. The drop is attributed to several factors, including a $10 billion whale sale, newly announced tariffs, inflation data, and geopolitical threats. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's resilience offers motivation for altcoin enthusiasts. An analyst and investor known as Evanss6 suggests that the time for change might have arrived. “ETH continues to trade below the levels seen when ETFs were released, which seems incorrect. For example, Grayscale's surplus supply has been eliminated. If ETH begins to strengthen, this signals a potential rise for altcoins as well. The transition from over 1,000 days of negativity impacts all altcoins. Currently, negative factors like tariff letters are not hindering Ether's progress. Hence, altcoins might experience notable increases over the next two weeks. The markets are set to be active again in August, and unless tariffs are further delayed, they will be absorbed by the markets. The extent, or even presence, of a drop remains uncertain. However, by September, the expectation is a renewed interest in altcoins due to potential altcoin ETF approvals, potentially priced in by the market earlier.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As it sped into Crypto Week on Tuesday, the U.S. House's process toward passing digital assets bills ground to a sudden halt over a procedural vote as members of the House Freedom Caucus objected to the way some of the legislation has developed under Senate dominance. The legislation still has strong, bipartisan support, suggesting the procedural mishap may be overcome as a further vote was scheduled for later Tuesday afternoon. More than a dozen Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the motion. Two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk another vote has been aimed for 5:00 p.m. ET, meaning this disruption could be resolved without delaying the more important votes currently expected on Wednesday and Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republicans to vote in favor of the rule earlier Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, saying passing GENIUS would help keep the U.S. ahead of other countries in crypto development. Bitcoin BTC$116,422.26 and ether (ETH) each knee-jerked lower by about 0.5% on the news, but both have recovered most of those declines. High-flying stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) has moved to its session low, down 5.3% on the day. The stock remains higher by roughly six-fold since its IPO last month. It's uncertain whether a similar delay could be forced by unhappy Republicans on this week's bills.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Republicans today blocked a procedural motion that would have allowed formal consideration of several key crypto regulations, including the GENIUS, CLARITY, and Anti-CBDC bills, a defense spending bill, and an amendment to release the Epstein files. The motion failed by a vote of 196 to 223, with a majority of Republicans voting against it. As a result, the crypto legislation and related measures could not advance to floor debate or final passage. Majority Leader Steve Scalise had scheduled the vote to set the terms of debate, with final passage expected later this week. Speaker Mike Johnson pointed to internal disagreements within the Republican caucus. “We have some members who really, really want to emphasize the House's product,” Johnson said, referring to calls to merge the crypto bills into a single legislative package. Majority Leader Steve Scalise echoed the internal divide, saying, “I was one of those who would like to see the whole package as one. The question is, do we play games with the Senate bill when the president has made it clear he wants GENIUS on his desk as it's written?” The procedural failure also blocked consideration of a separate amendment that would have compelled the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's files. For now, key crypto legislation and unrelated controversial amendments remain in limbo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans are still planning to pass three pieces of crypto-related legislation, but a majority of members in the House voted against a resolution to consider the bills. Cryptocurrency-related bills backed by US President Donald Trump failed to clear a key procedural step in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, despite the president's public push for action. In a Tuesday post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump ordered all Republicans to vote yes on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate payment stablecoins in the US. The legislation is one of three bills, along with ones to address market structure and central bank digital currencies, that Republican House leaders had been pushing as part of the party's “crypto week” plans. The president may have been referring to a House resolution to consider the three bills and a defense bill, which failed to get support from a majority of lawmakers present on Tuesday — at least 13 Republicans may have voted against the resolution. House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly said the chamber would take up another vote “this afternoon.” Related: Congress opens crypto bill debate with claims of ‘GOP giveaway' to industry “World Liberty Financial has received a significant portion of its funding from overseas, which has brought about serious ethical and national security concerns,” said California Representative Maxine Waters' office on Tuesday, adding: “[F]oreign investment is not just a business deal, it's a direct payment to the sitting US president with the goal of currying favor and influence within the White House.” Many Democratic leaders have responded to Republicans' push for the digital assets bills with their own “anti-crypto corruption week” agenda. They are calling for amendments in the three bills to address consumer protection and prevent the president, vice president, and members of Congress from holding or promoting crypto over concerns with conflicts of interest.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday publicly called on all Republicans to vote in favor of the GENIUS Act, a sweeping crypto bill aimed at positioning the United States as the global leader in digital assets during what is now being billed as "Crypto Week." Calling the GENIUS Act "tremendous," Trump said it would put the U.S. "lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others," and asked that "ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!" The move signals his administration's growing embrace of crypto-friendly policy, setting a sharp contrast with regulatory approaches under previous leadership. “It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE,” Trump stressed in idiosyncratic fashion. Also Read: Polymarket Home Free As Trump-Led DOJ Closes Biden-Initiated Probes Why It Matters: The GENIUS Act, short for Guiding Enhanced National Innovation for Unified Standards, is expected to clarify how cryptocurrencies are regulated across federal agencies. This vote comes amid "Crypto Week," an unofficial term used by industry insiders to describe the flurry of legislative and executive activity this week in support of digital assets. Alongside the GENIUS Act, additional bills are expected to clarify how securities laws apply to blockchain tokens and establish new rules for stablecoin issuance. While not expected to impact price action in major currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD, the bills will impact the regulatory framework cryptocurrencies like XRP XRP/USD operate under. House lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill later today. Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pump.fun Token Tops $2 Billion in Market Cap Following Massive ICO—But It Hasn't Caught Bonk Yet It followed a massive $600 million initial coin offering, or ICO, that sold out in just 12 minutes over the weekend. Still, PUMP remains below BONK in terms of market cap, a meme coin project that is butting heads with Pump.fun as it steals Solana launchpad market share. At the time of writing, Pump.fun sits at a market capitalization of $2 billion, according to CoinGecko, making it the 63rd largest cryptocurrency. To put that into perspective, that puts the project above the official meme coin for U.S. President Donald Trump and Sam Altman's World, formerly known as Worldcoin. To be clear, BONK launched as a Solana meme coin in late 2022. By January, it had started to pick up steam, slid, and then pumped as the developers burned 5 trillion coins to buoy the price. The team and community that created Bonk have gone on to create a Telegram trading tool BonkBot, a dog charity Buddies for Paws, and more. Meme coin launchpad LetsBonk, which debuted in April, is the latest of those projects. Last week, LetsBonk flipped Pump.fun in daily created tokens and has remained on top for seven out of the last eight days, according to Dune data. However, LetsBonk also lets the deployer control the total token supply and is underpinned by Raydium's LaunchLab infrastructure. Bonk is integrated into dozens of DeFi projects, games, and dev tools, and even has its own stadium sponsorship. That said, Pump.fun is undeniably one of the largest crypto projects to emerge in recent years, becoming the fastest crypto company to hit $100 million in revenue last year. Since then, it has topped $784 million in revenue, according to Dune data. It has resulted in more than 11.89 million tokens being created since its January 2024 launch, many of which have been viral successes—think Moo Deng, Fartcoin, and Chill Guy. More recently, the project has invested more into expanding its streamer ecosystem by funding big streamer projects and paying users to post viral clips of their favorite Pump.fun creators. Those bullish on PUMP are now eagerly awaiting details on when the launchpad will airdrop tokens to users of the platform. In its tokenomics, 24% of the supply was dedicated to “Community & Ecosystem initiatives,” which many believe suggests an airdrop is on its way. Predictors on Myriad Markets believe there is a 47.7% chance that Pump.fun airdrops by the end of July. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.) As you can expect, a stream of knock-off coins were launched alongside PUMP, including the Official Pump—which is very much not official. It peaked at a $3.13 million market cap and has since crashed 74.75%. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With big names like Apple toying with blockchain solutions, the potential for decentralized payments in tech is starting to show its face, and it looks promising. Let's take a closer look at how this crypto payroll for startups scene is shaping up. These days, it seems like everyone is jumping on the crypto payroll bandwagon, especially startups eager to harness the magic of blockchain tech. By using stablecoins—like USDC for freelancer invoicing—companies can ensure payments are quick and immune to the wild price swings that come with most cryptocurrencies. This isn't just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how businesses are getting their money where it needs to go. It's getting a serious makeover thanks to blockchain payments. More and more companies are waking up to the benefits of decentralized payroll tools, which not only speed up payment processes but also lighten the administrative load. With crypto payroll platforms, businesses can hire remote developers globally, tapping into talent without the usual geographical restrictions. This is especially useful in gaming and digital content creation, where timely payments keep the creative juices flowing. Decentralized payroll solutions come with a bag full of perks that traditional systems can't match. With blockchain, every transaction is recorded, making it hard to pull a fast one. These benefits are especially attractive as remote work becomes the new normal. Businesses are on the lookout for ways to make their operations smoother, and this seems like a solid option. But hold up, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Cryptos can swing wildly, and not everyone wants to be paid in something that might tank overnight. As we peer into the crystal ball, it looks like crypto payroll in tech is here to stay. The perks of decentralized payroll solutions, paired with the growing acceptance of blockchain, suggest that crypto payments are set to become a mainstream option. By embracing these changes, companies could streamline their operations and attract the talent needed to thrive in a digital world. Yeah, the evolution of crypto payroll integration isn't just about new payment methods. It's about rethinking what compensation looks like in the modern workforce. As more companies see the potential of blockchain payments, we may soon find ourselves in a world where crypto payroll isn't just an option—it's the norm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While top cryptocurrency tore through $123,000 this week, most altcoins — everything that isn't Bitcoin — are lagging behind. So, when are the cryptocurrencies not named Bitcoin going to enjoy their bull market? “For a full-scale altcoin rally, we need two things: profit rotation and confidence,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News. “Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively.” This month, Bitcoin has enjoyed a 12% price rally as three crypto bills worm their way through Washington, exchange-traded fund inflows remain stable, a wave of corporates buy Bitcoin, and the anticipation the Federal Reserve cutting interest rate grows. “The biggest driver for altcoin performance in the coming weeks and months is going to be investor sentiment and overall risk appetite,” he said. And real yields are still low — a recipe, Enzersdorfer-Konrad says, for capital to flow into higher-risk bets like DeFi, gaming tokens, and tokenised real-world assets. That's because Bitcoin is yet to consolidate at a price level, allowing investors to start moving down the risk curve. Enzersdorfer-Konrad is cautious about whether that will soon translate into new price records for the likes of Ethereum, XRP and Solana. A lot “will depend on overall market sentiment, global liquidity, and whether investors are ready to move further out on the risk curve,” he said.

In a three-page objection filed on 14 July, Massachusetts resident Brad Wyatt, a former top 10 holder of NFL Reignmaker NFTs, criticised the Plan of Allocation's use of “Prize Receipts” as a deduction in calculating how much each class member will receive. The lawsuit, led by plaintiff Justin Dufoe, alleges that DraftKings violated federal securities law by offering NFTs as unregistered investment contracts. Wyatt's objection centres on the formula used to determine “Individual Recognised Loss” (IR), which includes deductions for “Prize Receipts” (PR) from fantasy contests run separately on the DraftKings platform. He said: “Including these Prize Receipts does not offset the economic harm suffered by class members as the proposed settlement regarding the purchase and sale of NFT securities on DraftKings Marketplace is unrelated to potential realised or unrealised prize receipts from playing in DraftKings Fantasy Sport skill-based contests”. He further alleged that DraftKings inflated the fair market value of these prizes and that their inclusion in the formula results in “an unfair reduction of each class action participant's NFT owners' Individual Recognised Loss.” Wyatt urged the court to adopt a revised formula that excludes Prize Receipts altogether, arguing that doing so would “better adhere to securities law principles and promote a more equitable distribution of damages”. According to transaction data provided by DraftKings, Wyatt spent nearly $462,000 acquiring NFTs on the primary and secondary markets, but only received around $245,000 in resale and marketplace closure proceeds. Prize Receipts accounted for an additional $252,000 in notional value, which Wyatt argues should not be treated as offsetting cash. A final approval hearing has yet to be scheduled, and objections remain open until 21 days before that date.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress. Ethereum's role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike. House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar's global lead. BofA launches new weekly periodical ‘On Chain,' designed to “drill into the various facets of the fast-evolving digital assets ecosystem.” Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure. That nod isn't just for the token itself. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum's lead. Still, the network's mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee.</p>

Bitcoin and most altcoins declined due to profit-taking among investors. It is common for cryptocurrencies and stocks to pull back slightly after going parabolic. Cryptocurrencies are also falling as market participants await the outcome of “Crypto Week.” Republicans will consider three bills this week, including CLARITY, GENIUS, and one related to central bank digital currencies. Many of them remember Donald Trump's “Infrastructure Week” during his first term. The chart above shows that Bitcoin price formed a shooting star pattern on Monday. As such, mean reversion suggests that BTC may keep falling to bridge this gap. This B&R pattern is a common continuation signal in technical analysis. The more probable scenario is that BTC drops to $110,000 and then resumes its uptrend, potentially triggering another rally among altcoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Dakota, a neobank cofounded by a former Coinbase executive, aims to combine both corners of finance—and investors are betting it'll succeed. On Tuesday, the startup announced that it had raised $12.5 million in a Series A led by the crypto venture firm CoinFund. The raise was purely for equity, said Ryan Bozarth, cofounder and CEO of Dakota. “Dakota [was] one of the first companies I had seen in the Web3 payment space that had a significant share of non-crypto customers,” Alex Felix, chief investment officer at CoinFund, told Fortune. The injection of capital into Dakota, which uses stablecoins to move money between itself and its customers, is the latest bet from VCs on a company involved in one of the buzziest sectors of crypto. Stablecoins are tokens pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, and proponents claim they can speed up cross-border payments and reduce transaction fees. While stablecoins are more than a decade old, the asset class has taken center stage this past year after interest from large fintechs and regulatory progress on Capitol Hill. In February, Stripe acquired the stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion. He's also a former Coinbase executive who managed the U.S. crypto exchange's custody arm, or portion of the business that holds large amounts of crypto on behalf of corporate clients. In 2022, Bozarth left Coinbase to found Dakota. His neobank functions much like any other bank. It has checking accounts and provides users, mainly businesses, yield on the money they've deposited. But instead of relying on decades-old financial technology, it uses stablecoins to move money between it and its many banking partners. (Dakota does not have its own bank charter but is regulated in the U.S. and Europe as a money services business, said Bozarth.) Over the past year, it's processed about $1.6 billion in transaction volume and is on pace to record $4 billion by December, Bozarth said.

Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor. Lawmakers are poised to consider three major pieces of legislation that supporters say will “make America the crypto capital of the world.” Those in less sexy asset classes will have to dream of a future Fixed Income Friday on Capitol Hill. Bitcoin, which is up roughly 30% this year and did pare its gains back below $120,000, was not alone, as other leading cryptocurrencies Ether, Solana and Chainlink advanced on Monday. Providing this kind of certainty would likely encourage traditional institutional investors like asset management firms, hedge funds, and banks — some of which have kept a cautious approach to crypto due to a lack of clarity around legal compliance — to grab their knees and plunge in. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing its own central bank digital currency – if passed, that would amount to lawmakers articulating a preference for market-driven innovation in the crypto space over state-led initiatives. The bill would require them to be backed by liquid assets like dollars or Treasury bonds, and issuers would have to disclose their reserve holdings. Stablecoin use has grown considerably in recent months, and many believe they could be used for instant payments — Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, which would allow them to skip billions in traditional financial transaction fees. The optimism is already registering in crypto and traditional markets: Strategic Antics: The GENIUS Act received bipartisan support in the Senate and is most likely to reach President Donald Trump's desk first. But many Democrats are opposed, as well as to the CLARITY Act, which critics have argued contains threadbare protections for consumers and against fraud. A planned 50% tariff on copper has left commodities markets roiling and analysts toiling with the idea consumers paying for higher prices. Even after TikTok is kicked off app stores later this year, the current app will keep working for US users until March. The US debt is about the same as its entire economic output and is projected to grow if Trump's megabill passes. The S&P 500's recent record high marked an encouraging sign that markets are no longer all that concerned with worst-case trade war scenarios. Experts have already warned that rollbacks to electric vehicle tax incentives will slow sales growth big time. In May, POTUS scrapped the “de minimis” exemption that allowed Shein and Temu to ship packages worth less than $800 to the US duty-free.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An illustration picture taken in London on May 8, 2022, shows a souvenir Tether (USDT) coin, which is one of the world's biggest stablecoins. Companies like Amazon or Walmart are considering adopting them, while big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are exploring launching their own stablecoins, according to The Wall Street Journal. What's more, Congress is on the verge of adopting legislation this week that would provide a formal framework for the sector, effectively making stablecoins part of U.S. regulations. As a concept, stablecoins are pretty groundbreaking in the world of money. A key vision behind stablecoins is that people and companies should be able to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous banks or money transfer companies, that take time and charge fees, getting in the way. But as detractors point out, there are real risks to stablecoins. The relatively recent set of rules and its ease of use have also attracted shady actors like drug dealers and ransomware hackers. Unlike other types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have a secret weapon that are meant to make them far safer. That's because as the name implies, each stablecoin is meant to be stable. (Dollars are primarily used to back stablecoins, but euros or some other asset of value like gold can also be used). NPR's Planet Money — and others — have perhaps the neatest analogy. Stablecoins are like the chips you get in a casino. It's probably the reason why stablecoins today are mainly used to buy and trade other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, because of the ease with which they can be converted to cash. Stablecoins are used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which is currently trading at record highs. The biggest company in this arena is Tether, which has a stablecoin called USDT and is based in El Salvador. The second is Circle, which issues a stablecoin called USDC. World Liberty Financial, in which his family has financial interests, has issued one called USD1, meaning the president stands to benefit financially from the increased adoption of stablecoins (though as of now USD1 has a miniscule market share). Citigroup projects that the total amount of outstanding stablecoin could hit $1.6 to $3.7 trillion by 2030. Congress is also on the verge of adopting legislation that would provide a formal framework for the sector, effectively making stablecoins part of U.S. regulations. Among other aspects, the Act mandates that stablecoin issuers must hold proper one-to-one reserves and seeks to ensure that issuers are obeying anti-money laundering rules — though critics deride the measures as too weak. The real excitement around stablecoins is that they provide a real-life advantage: They can make transferring money easier in a world where digital wallets and mobile payments are becoming more and more common. In some developing countries, where dollars aren't easily accessible, companies with an international trading business are already starting to use stablecoin to expedite money transfers from their partners, transactions that usually take days or weeks through the traditional banking system. With stablecoin, payments across companies can be transferred instantaneously at a fraction of the costs even if they are in different countries. Such payments were estimated at a mere $6 billion in February, a very small sliver of the market — but those in the industry see its potential. Yellow Card, a stablecoin payments company with offices in 16 African countries, says it facilitates these types of transactions. CEO Chris Maurice says stablecoins provide a "bridge" for companies to interact with the global economy. "It doesn't matter what industry you're in, it doesn't matter if you're in financial services or you're in the business of selling shoes on the side of the road. Stablecoins could make international transactions easier in emerging markets where dollars are not that easily accessible. And it's not just companies — there are potential advantages for regular folks too. Big retailers such as Amazon are hoping to benefit from stablecoins because they would no longer have to pay billions of dollars in fees for credit card transactions. Buying something on Amazon or Walmart may seem instantaneous. But retailers have to pay fees and completing an entire transaction with different credit card companies or banks can take days. "What people don't know is the payments that we all make every day, day to day, and the payments that institutions make back and forth to each other sometimes takes as much as a week to fully settle out and costs a fair amount of money for a fairly simple transaction," says Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy Officer at crypto exchange Coinbase. There's a question that still lingers: Are stablecoins actually safe? Stablecoin companies bristle at the question, and they are adamant that they safeguard their customers' money by parking them in ultra-safe investments such as U.S. Treasury bills. New York's attorney general investigated Tether and crypto exchange Bifinex, accusing the two companies of not maintaining proper one-to-one reserves. Stablecoins, if adopted, could reduce the fees merchants such as Amazon must pay to credit cards. He says it is a big leap of faith to believe that stablecoin companies are properly holding reserves backing the stablecoin. He adds that even though it might seem more onerous, the current payment system has checks and balances in place via credit card companies or banks, which offer "a critical beneficial role for all consumers." There's the other big concern about stablecoins: They are suspected of being used by all kinds of illicit actors like drug dealers and scammers who need a way to transfer money and access the cash without being detected by regulators or the police. "Even though you can see every payment on the Internet, you don't necessarily know who it's from and who it's to," says Darrell Duffie at Stanford University, who teaches finance and management. Critics worry that stablecoins could even pose a threat to the financial system. A similar scenario could play out if customers rush en masse to cash in their stablecoins — and the issuers find themselves unable to pay back customers. Stablecoin issuers are holding many of their customer reserves at traditional lenders, weaving in the banking system into the stablecoin sector. And stablecoin issuers also keep a huge chunk of their money in U.S. Treasury bills, which is a common practice across the sector. So a run on the bank could force stablecoin companies to quickly draw in their reserves at traditional lenders and lead them to sell off their U.S. debt in a hurry, thus sparking intense volatility. They have real-life potential — but they are a relatively new financial product, one that critics fear will open up all kinds of risks that may not be so apparent right now, leading to unintended consequences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Trump administration and politicians on both sides of the aisle are pushing for that regulatory clarity this week,” Rocco said, but critics of the proposed bills say they do little to protect consumer investors and give issuers too much freedom. “These bills could sow the seeds of the next financial crisis because they are regulatory wolves in sheep's clothing," said Mark Hays, associate director for cryptocurrency and financial technology at Americans for Financial Reform, a progressive non-profit that advocates for stronger Wall Street regulations.

The House will weigh three crypto bills this week: Locally, New York Attorney General Letitia James early this month urged congressional leaders to strengthen the GENIUS Act to regulate issuers of stablecoin, such as banks, to combat the anonymous use of the currency in criminal activity and transactions. Here are three things to know about bitcoin's rally and crypto week: One major factor behind the recent rally on bitcoin, Rocco said, is that investors and crypto businesses believe that the week's scheduled bill votes will bring regulatory clarity. Without regulation, it makes it harder for businesses in the market to know exactly what they can and cannot do. Investors are also turning to bitcoin, he said, as a safe haven investment in the wake of Congress' approval of President Donald Trump's "one big beautiful bill." “These assets are betting on a weakening U.S. dollar,” Rocco said. Additionally, bitcoin has been impacted by the growth of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, said Craig Rudes, partner at Long Island Block Chain, a technical consulting firm for blockchain technology. Bitcoin ETFs, which first began trading in 2024, are financial products that allow investors to invest in crypto without directly owning it or needing to create separate digital asset accounts. Rocco said it's likely that prices will slow down after passage of the bills, as growing crypto prices generally come about as a result anticipated favorable market conditions. “There's been a lot of hype into this week,” he said. “These companies have been begging for this clarity,” he said. As far as the legislation's impact on Long Island investors goes, Rudes said the passage of stablecoin regulations will usher in an age of cheaper transactions. “No longer will we paying MasterCard and Visa these percentages on transactions.” Hays with Americans for Financial Reform said the bills fail to protect consumers. Under the proposed Clarity Act, Hays said crypto would be treated like commodities rather than securities, facing far less scrutiny and regulation. Study on sharks in LI's waters ...
