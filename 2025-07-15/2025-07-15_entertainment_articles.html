                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor with American Idol, and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found shot to death Monday in their home in the Encino area of Los Angeles, sources have confirmed to  Deadline. Los Angeles police told Deadline that officers were called to the home on White Oak Place at about 2:30 PM Monday on a welfare check after the couple had not been seen for several days. No motive has been determined, an LAPD spokesperson said. Andrea Gibson Dies: Poet Featured In Award-Winning 2025 Sundance Documentary Was 49 David Kaff Dies: Spinal Tap Keyboardist "Viv Savage" Was 79 Her other television credits as Music Supervisor included the NAACP Image Awards, Miss USA, Miss Universe, Lip Sync Battle, Hollywood Game Night, Q'Viva , The Dance Scene, Dance Your Ass Off, Your Chance To Dance, Adventures of Power and Crashed, among many others. She appeared in a 2019 episode of The Pop Disciple Podcast. According to her bio on the website, Kaye began her career working for Waylon Jennings in Nashville, eventually joining MTM Records as Vice President of Artist Development. After two years as an artist manager at Sound Management in Chicago, she moved to Los Angeles and following a brief stint in music publishing, joined the Film & TV Licensing department at Universal Records. From there she went on to PolyGram Records, where she ran the combined Film & TV Division until its sale to Universal. In 2000, she launched her own company SyncroniCity, initially representing labels and artists such as Andrea Bocelli, Kenny Loggins, Lang Lang, Donnie Osmond and Steven Bishop. The company then segued to focusing strictly on music supervision for music intensive shows, such as American Idol. TMZ first reported news of Kaye and Deluca's deaths.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. First-time Emmy nominee Erin Doherty cooked up a pretty good distraction ‚Äî literally ‚Äî when it came to nominations morning. ‚ÄúI was made very aware of [the nominations] and have been made very aware of it, from my girlfriend in particular, she was like, ‚ÄòAre you going to watch?' Related Stories 2025 Emmy Nominations Are Here: See the Full List of Nominees How to Watch the 2025 Emmy Nominations Announced Live Incredible news: not just her nomination, but 13 overall for the limited series, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series, plus acting noms for co-creator Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper, Ashley Walters, and Christine Tremarco. ‚ÄúI'm so happy for the show, I'm so proud to be a part of it,‚Äù a giddy Doherty said over Zoom. Breakout star Cooper is the driving force of two of those episodes, including the gobsmacking third episode, in which his character Jamie (being held in a youth detention facility before his trial for murdering a classmate) sits down with forensic psychologist Briony Ariston (Doherty) for an unnerving interview. While the pair rehearsed for two weeks before shooting, much has been made of the improvisational magic Cooper and Doherty made. They shot two takes a day, five days straight. By the end of it, Cooper told IndieWire previously, he was tired. ‚ÄúSo that by the time it ended ‚Äî and, if you've seen it, [you know] the episode ends in such a climactic release of emotions for me ‚Äî I left that room and was hugging [series director] Phil [Barantini] and Owen and all our crew, I was just kind of happy to be out of there. Genuinely, we created such an authentic, horrible environment that I just remember being so grateful to have come to an end.‚Äù It was only after filming had ended, Doherty said, did she have the time and space to reflect back on what they had made. ‚ÄúI knew that it was important and vital, but it was only afterwards that I was like, I think we might have made something really special there,‚Äù she said. Watching the show as a fan also offered Doherty continued perspective. ‚Ä¶ There is no way I'm depriving myself of this opportunity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe whole thing was obviously harrowing and disturbing, but I'm so grateful that I got to sit and receive it in that way, because now I get to have those conversations in the world [with other audience members].‚Äù Those conversations run the gamut, she said, from longer chats to quick interactions, the latter of which might be her favorite. ‚ÄúWhat I'm so kind of taken aback by is that a lot of the conversations are just random people on the street, on the tube, being like, ‚ÄòThank you for that show,'‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is such a gorgeous communication to have with someone, like that's all I'd ever wished to say to people when specific stories have been told that have really hit me. ‚Ä¶ I think people are just grateful that the conversation is now on the table because it's such a tricky subject matter and one that I think we were all quite afraid of.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúWhat this show is so great at is, it doesn't actually go, ‚ÄòAnd here are the answers,' because we don't have those answers. And I think that's where thank you's come from.‚Äù We always have been, but there's always going to be that dynamic with TV and film of like, ‚ÄòIt it going to put bums in seats? It's all about, will people watch this thing and, I think this show proves that we want these really authentic stories. That's, Doherty thinks, why shows like ‚ÄúAdolescence‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaby Reindeer‚Äù truly succeed. ‚ÄúThat's why it absolutely hit the stratosphere in a way that no one was anticipating, because there's such courage behind there,‚Äù Doherty said, ‚ÄúI'm so grateful for Netflix for having the ability to just [let] ‚Ä¶ Jack and Stephen write this story in as true a way as you can, and that's it. There's such integrity within storytelling, it clearly has an impact. That, for me, is what good art does.‚Äù All episodes of ‚ÄúAdolescence‚Äù are now streaming on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath‚Äòs ‚ÄúBack to the Beginning‚Äù raised more money than any charity concert since George Harrison and Ravi Shankar‚Äòs 1971 Concert for Bangladesh popularized the very idea of an all-star benefit show, according to a review of Billboard‚Äòs coverage over the years. The heavy metal show, billed as Osbourne's final stage performance, raised roughly $190 million in charitable donations on July 5, according to an Instagram post from the event's musical director, Tom Morello. Notably, that was a big jump from the $140 million Morello said the event raised in an earlier Instagram story, but the event's promoters did not respond to requests for clarification. According to statements from the group and its charity partners, the concert, watched by 40,000 ticketholders and 5.8 million individuals online, will distribute funds equally to Birmingham Children's Hospital, Acorn Children's Hospice and Cure Parkinson's ‚Äî an organization dedicated to finding a cure for the disease Osbourne has lived with since 2019. It is unclear yet what the final donation to each charity will be. Each of those charities said they were able to raise tens of thousands of pounds in additional donations by raffling off tickets to the show, auctioning off iconic art and band photographs donated by Black Sabbath, and through individual contributions from fans as they streamed into the concert, which took place at Villa Park in Birmingham, England. Notably, reports from Billboard and other media outlets have relied on figures provided by people affiliated with these concerts, as promoters are not required to publish the total funds raised or how much is deducted to cover expenses. FireAid, the five-hour-long mega-concert that featured performances by Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga and Green Day in January 2025, raised more than $100 million for victims of the Los Angeles wildfires that killed 29 people and destroyed more than 16,000 homes earlier that same month. Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof raised another $10 million for those ravaged by famine before the festival through the release of ‚ÄúDo They Know It's Christmas?‚Äù, the best-selling British single that featured U2 and Phil Collins. Willie Nelson's Farm Aid, the music industry's longest-running charity concert that launched in 1985 to support family farmers hurt by the downturn in the market value of American crops, has raised more than $80 million to support family farmers over the past 40 years. According to Billboard, among the first funds dispersed from the charity was a $100,000 check Nelson wrote to a church group that used the money to feed farm families. Organized by George Clooney and Haiti-born rapper Wyclef Jean, ‚ÄúHope for Haiti Now‚Äù was a telethon that raised more than $57 million for the island country after the devastating magnitude-7 quake that killed some 200,000 people and left 3 million hurt or homeless in January 2010. Artists like Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z and Chris Martin performed songs as celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman took donations by phone. The Concert for Bangladesh was actually a pair of sold-out Madison Square Garden shows organized by former Beatles guitarist Harrison and Indian sitar player Shankar, intended to raise funds for refugees of the conflict in East Pakistan during its fight for independence. However, by 1985, the event had sent, via UNICEF, an estimated $12 million to Bangladesh through revenue raised from a live album and film, Concert for Bangladesh.

Just when you thought awards season was over, it's time for the Emmys. Only one of last year's nominees for Best Drama Series remains eligible in 2025, which makes securing a nod (and snagging the trophy) that much more valuable. With 600 programs submitted in the Best Series categories ‚Äî only 14 fewer than last year ‚Äî there is still far too much TV for any voter to watch in the time allotted, which means‚Ä¶ there will be snubs. Here at IndieWire, a ‚Äúsnub‚Äù is just industry shorthand for a series or individual who was expected to be nominated, thought to be deserving of a nomination, or both, and yet ‚Äî for whatever reason ‚Äî they did not receive recognition for their work. Labeling any such program or person a ‚Äúsnub‚Äù does not convey intent; it does't mean their peers had it out for them, or voters purposefully shunned one potential nominee in favor of another. On the other end of the spectrum, anything dubbed a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù is a series or individual who was thought to be out of the running before nominations were announced; something or someone who was written off too early, whether it was because they didn't mount much of a campaign, didn't match up well in their category, or simply didn't get the typical plaudits heaped upon your standard Emmy nominee. By and large, it's best if you remember, dear readers, that the very nature of competition means not everyone can win (or, in this case, be nominated), and it's only human for those invested in television to react with shock and awe, admiration and anger, to the TV Academy's picks for the season's best shows. The 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set for Sunday, September 14 at 8 p.m. Many prognosticators feared the lead of ‚ÄúAndor‚Äù would get boxed out of the heated race for Best Actor in a Drama Series, and indeed he did. Sterling K. Brown (‚ÄúParadise‚Äù) proved his enduring appeal to the TV Academy, as did Pedro Pascal (despite appearing in less than half of ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù Season 2). Actors in blockbuster entertainment (like a ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù show) have long struggled to gain traction with awards voters, although Brown and Scott's inclusion tarnishes any theories about bias against science-fiction. Odds are the competition was simply too stiff in Luna's category and one favorite had to lose out. (That doesn't explain why Forest Whitaker is the lone ‚ÄúAndor‚Äù acting nominee ‚Äî well-deserved! ‚Äî so perhaps there's ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù fatigue within the Academy?) Either voters soured on the narrative's repetitive nature, were frustrated by its cliffhanger ending, or simply preferred this year's other dramas! We were preparing to mourn yet another year of snubs for Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen's excellent HBO comedy, but then the TV gods blessed us with two whole nominations! OK, sure, ‚ÄúSomebody Somewhere‚Äù ‚Äî the best series of 2024 ‚Äî deserves more than single digit nods, but considering one is for Best Writing (honoring both creators and star Bridget Everett) and the other is for breakout supporting star Jeff Hiller, it's hard to complain. You just know Sam and Joel would be giddy right now, already on their way downtown to celebrate over donuts and karaoke. Alfonso Cuaron's cunning Apple TV+ series was widely expected to perform well in a down year for limited series, but it could only muster two total nominations: Cate Blanchett (of course) for Best Actress in a Limited Series, and Emmanuel Lubezki and Bruno Delbonnel for Best Cinematography in a Limited Series. Although these were clearly the show's most widely hailed elements, Kevin Kline was a surprise exclusion in Best Actor, and ‚ÄúDisclaimer‚Äù also got nudged out of Best Limited Series in favor of the latest season of ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù (which now qualifies as an anthology). Be it recency bias or Netflix's wider reach, these losses have to sting for the pricey, ambitious adaptation. After ‚ÄúThe Good Place's‚Äù slow start became a respectable run with the TV Academy ‚Äî landing 12 nominations, including two for Best Comedy Series ‚Äî as well as ‚ÄúParks and Recreation's‚Äù late surge to 14 total nominations, it felt like Mike Schur's Netflix comedy ‚ÄúA Man on the Inside‚Äù was primed for a warm reception from the jump this time. Instead, just like both of his previous hits, it was shut out. Ted Danson's exclusion stings a bit extra, but the entire series warrants awards attention. Whatever thoughts you may have about Charlie Brooker's dystopic anthology ‚Äî that it will never measure up to the early seasons, that it's too close to reality, that it should end ‚Äî Season 7 was by most counts better than other recent installments, and ‚ÄúCommon People‚Äù starring Rashida Jones and Chris O'Dowd felt more like early days ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù than anything has for a while. As Amanda's health deteriorates in tandem with her family's financial status, Jones gives an aching performance with darkly comic flourishes, like when she becomes a human ad machine because of Rivermind's updated terms and conditions. Callister: Into Infinity,‚Äù a solid successor to one of the series' most popular episodes ever. Look, John Mulaney's chaotic collection of comics, experts, actors, and bits might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it spoke to its own eclectic audience and experimented boldly with a weekly release schedule. Instead of Hollywood and headline news, ‚ÄúEverybody's Live‚Äù tackles the topics people are already discussing in real life, turning watercooler conversations and group chat debates into televised entertainment ‚Äî not to mention the interstitial sketches, teen fight night, and pretty much every time Richard Kind pops up on screen. What's most baffling of all is this omission comes in a year where there are only three other nominees in the category. Despite strong reviews and two nominations at the Gotham TV Awards, Mara Brock Akil's adaptation of Judy Blume's novel never seemed to get any traction. Did voters think it was a YA series, better fit for the Children's and Family Emmys? Did Netflix prioritize its other, higher-profile drama contenders, like ‚ÄúSquid Game,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Diplomat,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBridgerton‚Äù? Did it need more star power to compete in a particularly starry Emmy field? We may never know, but anyone who saw ‚ÄúForever‚Äù knows it deserved better than this. Can the Emmys hand out an award for Outstanding Comedy Series in September if the year's best comedy isn't even nominated? I guess we'll find out, since Nathan Fielder's second season of ‚ÄúThe Rehearsal‚Äù flew away without a nod for the top category. The TV Academy has long been baffled by Fielder, who previously was only nominated for directing Sacha Baron Cohen's 2018 Variety series ‚ÄúWho Is America‚Äù and producing John Wilson's ‚ÄúHow To with John Wilson.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Rehearsal‚Äù landed zero nods for its first season, and ‚ÄúThe Curse‚Äù was notoriously blanked just last year (despite Emma Stone's star power). ‚ÄúThe Rehearsal‚Äù Season 2 was considered a dark horse, but its three TCA nominations in July (including for Program of the Year), rave reviews, and wider reach (thanks mainly to Fielder's go-for-broke finale) may have helped it break through, even if they weren't enough to land the top target. The first season of ‚ÄúWolf Hall‚Äù earned eight Emmy nominations, including nods for Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis, as well as Best Limited Series. The second season of ‚ÄúWolf Hall‚Äù‚Ä¶ did not earn eight Emmy nominations. In fact, it earned one ‚Äî for Best Period Costumes. PBS isn't at the top of voters' streaming queues, and historical dramas aren't in vogue (unless they're made by Shonda Rhimes or Julian Fellowes). OK, it's honestly a surprise that ‚ÄúPresumed Innocent‚Äù earned four nominations at all, given it wasn't nominated for Best Limited Series. That all four came for its cast, however, is less surprising and shows how limited the show's appeal was across the TV Academy's many branches. Still, most awards experts though Jake Gyllenhaal would lose out because the series debuted so long ago (last summer) and he couldn't do much campaigning while performing on Broadway in ‚ÄúOthello.‚Äù But his star power pushed him through, as it did for Peter Sarsgaard and Ruth Negga, two acclaimed turns from well-known actors (especially in awards circles). Yes, ‚ÄúAndor‚Äù did well overall with 14 nominations (including Best Drama Series). Kyle Soller and Denise Gough were two of the hit ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù show's biggest breakouts. Their exacting depictions of such appalling characters ‚Äî especially whenever their well-buried humanity would sneak up to the surface ‚Äî are simply outstanding, and seeing the Supporting Drama fields dominated by the same shows only makes excluding two clear standouts like these that much more frustrating. After speaking to him a few months ago ahead of the Season 1 finale, I know that possibly no one loves ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù more than executive producer and now lead actor nominee Sterling K. Brown. But ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù nabbing a nom for Outstanding Drama Series might hint at a bigger shift in TV viewing along with HBO's ‚ÄúThe Pitt‚Äù: that viewers crave the stakes and style of a weekly drama straight out of the network era, and that the episodic release model still has a spark. They're already working on Season 2 with plans to release within a year.) ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù foregrounds social inequality and intrigue at the end of the world, anchored by strong performances from Brown and James Marsden (also nominated) in particular. While we did call this nomination, it's a pleasant surprise and worthy reward for a show that gripped its viewers, this one included. One could argue Cooper's odds were better last year, when he popped up in ‚ÄúAbbott Elementary‚Äù as himself, but the limited screen time didn't offer the same impact as this, even if ‚ÄúAbbott‚Äù is far more beloved by the TV Academy than ‚ÄúGemstones.‚Äù Maybe he should've found a way to ‚ÄúThe White Lotus‚Äù? To be clear, Uzo Aduba landing an Emmy nomination is almost never a surprise. America‚Äù ‚Äî out of six total nominations (including this one). But despite her aforementioned series' success throughout the TV Academy, she's proven she doesn't need her show to be popular with Emmy voters to earn a slot all by herself. For her final nomination on ‚ÄúOrange Is the New Black,‚Äù she was one of two total nominations. Not even getting abandoned by the world's leading streamer can keep Aduba from attending another Emmys. Widely seen as the sixth most-likely nominee in a category with only five slots, ‚ÄúSay Nothing‚Äù wasn't expected to make a ton of noise on Emmy morning, but FX's thrilling, complex, and well-acted drama certainly warranted some sort of ruckus ‚Äî Lola Petticrew, especially. As Dolours Price, an IRA volunteer during the Troubles, Petticrew brings layers of intense conviction, cheeky confidence, and heartbreaking awareness to a soldier who's resolved to her fate, and gives all of herself anyway. In recent years, voters have broadened their horizons, even if the Best Animated Program category remains in the grip of classics like ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù and ‚ÄúBob's Burgers.‚Äù Both of those shows were recognized, as well, but they couldn't stop Joseph Bennett and Steve Hely's buzzy comedy-thriller from breaking through. When there's only two open slots and two of the contenders are ‚ÄúSNL‚Äù (the most awarded Emmy show of all-time with 101 trophies) and ‚ÄúLast Week Tonight with John Oliver‚Äù (winner of 30 Emmys itself and a perennial victor in the ever-shifting Variety categories), then the other nominees aren't expecting an upset. (Where else can you find guest stars Emma Stone, Steve Buscemi, Natasha Lyonne, Paul Dano, Amy Sedaris, and Cole Escola all in one place?) Excluding it in favor of another stale ‚ÄúSNL‚Äù season only goes to show how little room the TV Academy makes for new programs, especially the ones that don't fit cleanly in one of the pre-existing categories. The ‚ÄúWhite Lotus‚Äù alum (and ‚ÄúThe Bold Type‚Äù if you're a real one) soared in Molly Smith Metzler's limited series in which she plays a woman trying to retrieve her sister from the most deadly cult of all: wealth. Fahy is one piece of a dynamite cast she represents with this nomination, continuing a streak of sublime performances that deserve recognition. She's in a stacked category with Cate Blanchett, Cristin Milioti, Michelle, Williams, and Rashida Jones, and she couldn't be more worthy. Voters may have drifted back to Gilead when there were fewer new shows to watch, but this performance doesn't bode well for Hulu's sequel series, ‚ÄúThe Testaments.‚Äù Some may want to lump ‚ÄúThe Four Seasons‚Äù into the Snub category, given the fact that Tina Fey and Steve Carell's star power could only muster a single nomination‚Ä¶ but a) Fey's latest Netflix creation never built any buzz, which makes it very hard to compete in a crowded comedy field, and b) that single nomination came for Colman Domingo, who's on an enviable and well-deserved awards streak. Better than ever, you could say, after landing his second straight Emmy nomination (this year for ‚ÄúThe White Lotus,‚Äù last year for ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù) and third ever. (There was a 13-year gap after his lone nod for ‚ÄúJustified,‚Äù another role that certainly deserved greater recognition than the Emmys decided to provide.) But anyone who's seen Danny McBride's outrageous HBO comedy, ‚ÄúThe Righteous Gemstones,‚Äù knows Goggins created an all-time sitcom character in Uncle Baby Billy Freeman. Fully committed to the wayward preacher's sins and salvations, Goggins brings an enthralling bite to McBride's distinct vernacular and shapes his movements, posture, and overall presentation in such a specific manner, it's hard to believe Baby Billy isn't real. Prior to the Emmy nominations announcement, it was a widely accepted belief that ‚ÄúThe Studio‚Äù ‚Äî a TV show about making movies in Hollywood ‚Äî would do very well. Hollywood stories tend to be popular among Hollywood voters, and ‚ÄúThe Studio‚Äù benefitted from great reviews, a star-studded cast, and outrageous comedy. Among its many recognitions, Martin Scorsese and Ron Howard earned their first acting Emmy nominations, as ‚ÄúThe Studio‚Äù controlled five of the six Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series slots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The second season of HBO's genre hit racked up a lot of noms, including best lead acting nods for Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal (despite his rather limited screen time). HBO‚Äòs post-apocalyptic drama earned 16 Emmy nominations on Tuesday morning. While that's fewer than the first season's 24 noms, it still represents a terrific haul. Perhaps the most interesting nomination is that Pedro Pascal was nominated for best actor. While Pascal's performance was widely praised, his character Joel had very limited screen time, appearing in only three of the season's seven episodes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actress who portrayed Dr. Collins in Season 1 announced last week that she would not be returning to the HBO Max drama but said ‚Äúwhat a blessing‚Äù to participate. She called it an ‚Äúabsolute privilege to play Dr. Heather Collins in such a groundbreaking season and piece.‚Äù ‚ÄúI mean, we've all been sort of amused by the speculation about what everybody thinks might be a reason,‚Äù the actor continued. We enjoyed having her with us very much. She's gotten really big and we will miss her.‚Äù It was implied early on that she and Dr. Michael ‚ÄúRobby‚Äù Robinavitch's (Noah Wyle) were once in a relationship. On Tuesday, HBO Max's hit The Pitt earned 13 nominations on Tuesday, including nods for Outstanding Drama and Outstanding Actor for Noah Wyle. The freshman drama also logged nominations for supporting actress (Katherine LaNasa), guest actor (Shawn Hatosy), directing (John Wells and Amanda Marsalis), writing (Joe Sachs and R. Scott Gemmill), sound editing and casting. Production is underway on Season 2 of Max's medical drama The Pitt, which is shot on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, CA with exteriors shot on location in Pittsburgh, PA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Goodman turned heads at the ‚ÄúSmurfs‚Äù premiere with his incredible transformation, showcasing the results of his life-changing 200-pound weight loss journey. The 73-year-old actor stepped onto the red carpet at Paramount Pictures Studios in Los Angeles on Sunday, July 13, looking healthier and happier than ever in a sharp navy blue suit, brown loafers, and patterned tie. His commitment to health and wellness has been a gradual process, involving multiple elements including dietary changes, regular exercise, and sobriety. The beloved actor voices Papa Smurf in the upcoming animated musical film, which features an impressive cast including Rihanna, James Corden, Nick Offerman, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, and Hannah Waddingham. The movie hits theaters on July 18, marking another big moment in Goodman's continued acting career alongside his personal health success. Goodman's weight loss strategy involved working closely with personal trainer Mackie Shilstone, who helped him develop a comprehensive approach to health and fitness. The program focused on sustainable changes rather than temporary solutions, according to Men's Health. The Mediterranean diet played a central role in Goodman's nutritional transformation. The actor had previously told People that cutting sugar from his diet helped him drop 100 pounds, demonstrating the impact of targeted dietary modifications. ‚ÄúIt takes a lot of creative energy to sit on your ass and figure out what you're going to eat next,‚Äù Goodman shared with the outlet in 2010. Goodman committed to working out six days a week, taking 10,000 to 12,000 steps daily and using equipment like elliptical bikes and treadmills. This consistent physical activity helped build the foundation for his long-term weight management. Addressing his relationship with food, Goodman told ABC in 2016: ‚ÄúI'd have a handful of food and it'd go to my mouth. ‚ÄúIn the old days, I would take three months out, lose 60 or 70 pounds, and then reward myself with a 6-pack of Bud or whatever and just go back to my old habits,‚Äù Goodman explained to ABC. ‚ÄúThen this time I wanted to do it slowly, move, exercise. Eliminating alcohol became a crucial component of his lifestyle overhaul. Goodman's decision to pursue sobriety alongside his weight loss efforts addressed multiple health concerns simultaneously and contributed to his overall well-being transformation. The actor's approach to portion control also evolved significantly. Goodman told Howard Stern in 2016: ‚ÄúI took it slow. It's an ongoing process for the rest of my life.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Emmys are beloved among top-tier award shows for announcing their nominations at a reasonable hour, for the most part. Now that all of the nominations are out, this morning there are some initially eupeptic and caffeinated would-be contenders who just didn't get any love from voters at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. They might be taking a celebration swig or two at Apple TV+'s Severance, HBO Max's newbie The Pitt, Netflix's Adolescence and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Mendendez Story, plus Season 3 of HBO's The White Lotus right now. No surprise that Hacks, The Bear, Slow Horses‚Äò Gary Oldman ‚Äî now Sir Gary, actually ‚Äî and Abbott Elementary are back, and Succession chief Jesse Armstrong made the cut with Mountainhead, but last year's big winner Sh≈çgun isn't in the running this time round with Season 2 still to come from FX. With that, check out our look at those overlooked and a few unexpected noms, and tell us who you think we may have missed. And remember, hosted by Nate Bargatze, the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards will air live on CBS on September 14 from the Peacock Theater (which is a bit of unique cross-branding) in Los Angeles.

There are a lot of quips to make about the Force not being strong with the TV Academy today, but the truth is there is do and do not ‚Äì and voters foolishly didn't. The most watched platform around made some major Emmy moves this season with the sizzling Hot Ones, Good Mythical Morning and Challenge Accepted. Not calling the TV Academy voters old fashioned and out of touch, but notice how none of that trio are among the nominees Tuesday? One of the industry's hardest-working, most talented and charming actors, and a past Mad Man winner, should have broken into those ballot boxes to get the justice he deserved.

Seems not just the Academy but all of the awards shows seem to be snubbing Taylor Sheridan and all of his shows which this has been happening for years but yet no one has made a fuss about it like they do when others get snubbed. Yeah 1923 got several small nominations but they were in lesser known categories that most people don't even realize are there. Seems odd that one of the most viewed shows Yellowstone didn't even get any nominations in their final season even though they qualified and that could just be because the Academy was upset with Kevin Costner leaving but the show even without Kevin got record numbers so that should have not made a difference. The Four Seasons got so much press ‚Äî but I couldn't understand why. Horrible rich shallow people with no problems whining about their lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave ‚Äúthe inside story‚Äù about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America's biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor's mansion with Gov. When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank's executives they were this close ‚Äúto being sued right now.‚Äù After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, ‚Äúyou guys might be next.‚Äù It worked: ‚ÄúThey left a week later,‚Äù he said. Paxton's office did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment. In a statement, Consumers' Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is ‚Äúappalled at the lengths that Wall Street's financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúwe are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton's office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. Consumers' Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives' ‚Äúwar on woke.‚Äù That hasn't stopped conservatives ‚Äî ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests ‚Äî from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action. What Trump Has Said About Jeffrey Epstein Over the Years Jon Stewart Invites Elmo on ‚ÄòThe Daily Show' to Explain His ‚ÄòAlt-Right' Tweets He urged his allies to do the same: ‚ÄúAnybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power ‚Ä¶ states should be ramping up right now.‚Äù As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch ‚Äúunsubstantiated‚Äù attacks ‚Äúagainst climate initiatives,‚Äù as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters. ‚ÄúAt bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,‚Äù they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers' Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas' antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. Hild wanted more information ‚Äî the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, ‚Äúwithin weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,‚Äù big banks like Wells Fargo ‚Äústart dropping like flies‚Äù from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, ‚ÄúWe're not recording this, right? ‚Ä¶ Please don't quote me, because I'm telling the inside story on this.‚Äù Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo's dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives. According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo's Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers' Research. CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. Consumers' Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo's agenda. Since 2020, Consumers' Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and ‚Äúwoke capitalism,‚Äù with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC's largest known donor in 2023. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency. Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems' finances. He argued that's why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery network scored 142 Emmy nominations, compared to 121 for Netflix. This marks the most Emmy nominations HBO has ever received in a single year, beating its previous total of 137 in 2019. Why Some Of Your Favorites Won't Be Emmy-Nominated This Year Netflix won't be unhappy, however, beating its 107 nominations from last year to put it in second place, thanks to big mornings for Adolescence, which got 13, 11 noms for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and 10 for Black Mirror. Apple also had a great morning, scoring 79 nominations thanks to 27 noms for Severance and 23 noms for The Studio. If you add commercials, the company added two more noms. Disney scored 128 nominations across all of its platforms including ABC, Disney+, FX, Hulu and Nat Geo. Disney+ grew from 19 nominations last year to 28 nods this year thanks to a massive haul from Andor as well as some love for Agatha All Along and some documentaries such as Beatles '64.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's no ordinary day when one of the biggest rappers in the world calls you out, but Alex Warren is taking Drake‚Äòs recent diss in stride. In response to Drizzy's comments about the TikToker's smash hit ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù blocking the former's ‚ÄúWhat Did I Miss?‚Äù from debuting at No. In the clip, he dances along to Drake's ‚ÄúNokia,‚Äù staring innocently into the camera as he shakes his hips to the lyrics, ‚ÄúBaby girl/ Let me see you do your dance, let me see you twirl.‚Äù In lieu of a caption, Warren simply tagged Drake's username. ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù also happens to have never reached No. Warren's response comes shortly after the Canadian superstar expressed his disappointment with debuting at No. ‚ÄúI'm taking that soon don't worry one song or another,‚Äù he added at the time, sharing a graphic of the U.S. chart's top 10, which showed ‚ÄúWhat Did I Miss?‚Äù sitting just below Warren's ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù at No. He also now has 359 total entries on the ranking, more than any other artist in history. Plus, ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù has proven pretty hard to beat. Warren's breakthrough hit has spent a total of six weeks in the top spot, dethroned only temporarily by Sabrina Carpenter's ‚ÄúManchild‚Äù spending one week at No. Warren is currently fresh off the release of ‚ÄúOn My Mind‚Äù with ROS√â, which followed his Jelly Roll duet, ‚ÄúBloodline.‚Äù Both tracks will appear on Warren's new album, You'll Be Alright, Kid, which drops Friday (July 18).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Late on July 12th, fans of Jeff Lynne's Electric Light Orchestra were devastated to learn that the iconic musician was canceling what was to be his very final show at the BST Hyde Park festival. ‚ÄúJeff Lynne is heartbroken to report that he will not be able to perform at tomorrow's BST Hyde Park show,‚Äù BST Hyde Park's Instagram page read. ‚ÄúJeff has been battling a systemic infection and is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule.‚Äù A post shared by BST Hyde Park (@bsthydepark) Unfortunately for fans hoping to see Steve Winwood, the Doobie Brothers, or the other acts scheduled to perform on July 13th, it didn't happen. ELO also pulled out of their second-to-last performance at Manchester's Co-Op Live on July 10, minutes before showtime. A fan who had attended their show on July 9th reported that Lynne wasn't doing so well. Lynne first announced the BST Hyde Park Final Show in October 2024. ‚ÄúMy return to touring began at Hyde Park in 2014‚Äù, Jeff Lynne wrote on Instagram. ‚ÄúIt seems like the perfect place to do our final show. We couldn't be more excited to share this special night in London with our UK fans. As the song goes, ‚Äòwe're gonna do it One More Time! ‚ÄúI was riding in a taxi in London, who slammed on its brakes to avoid an accident, and I broke my hand,‚Äù he told the crowd. ‚ÄúBut nothing could keep me away from you tonight,‚Äù he added. On July 14th, Lynne posted an Instagram story with the caption, ‚ÄúToday at the Rose Garden in Hyde Park,‚Äù and featured a crowd of people singing ELO's hit song, ‚ÄúMr.</p>

Meanwhile, less than a week after Grok's big antisemitic tear, Elon Musk's xAI company, the makers of his so-called MechaHitler, scored a $200 million contract with the Department of Defence. Club covered earlier today, Sesame Street resident Elmo went rogue yesterday, as hackers took over Elmo's X account and began posting about, you guessed it, the Epstein client list and the Jews. Jon Stewart hosted Elmo on tonight's show, which was initially supposed to be about the tariffs. Trump added a 17% tax to Mexican tomatoes today. But instead, Stewart did an extended riff about Elmo getting radicalized by the manosphere because he is a victim of the Male Loneliness Epidemic. MAGA luminaries like Glenn Beck, Jesse Watters, and Lauren Ingraham have already publicly criticized the administration for its sudden about-face on the subject. It didn't work, and as such, his movement is in revolt for the time being. Basking in schadenfreude, Stewart delighted in telling America's red states that his new pronouns are ‚Äúhow does‚Äù and ‚Äúmy ass taste?‚Äù PASTEIn 1973, Bruce Springsteen Wrote the Greatest Summer Song Ever SPLINTERSources Say Zeldin's EPA Is Retaliating Against Declaration Signers ENDLESS MODE"We're Allowed to Be Happy": The Impact of Abby Anderson in The Last of Us Part II, Five Years Later Elmo and Donald Trump have some explaining to do on a new Daily Show Zach Cregger's Resident Evil reboot won't stick to the game's labyrinthine lore</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>David Kaff, who played keyboardist Viv Savage in Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, has died. His band Mutual of Alameda's Wild Kingdom shared the news to Facebook, writing ‚ÄúDavid always had a kind word and a quick wit that would slay you where you stand. Then he'd make you smile doing it!‚Äù A cause of death was not given, though the statement mentions that Kaff ‚Äúpassed away peacefully in his sleep‚Äù on Saturday, July 12. Born David Kaffinetti in 1946, Kaff got his start as a founding member of the British psychedelic rock band Rare Bird. Rare Bird's sole UK chart hit, 1970's ‚ÄúSympathy,‚Äù features a prominent organ line courtesy of Kaff. Despite a smaller role relative to lead actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, Kaff's Viv Savage left his mark thanks to a combination of physical comedy (especially during the film's staged concert footage) and quotable one-liners. At one point, asked by McKean's David St. Hubbins if he's able to play Nigel Tufnel's (Guest) bassline on ‚ÄúBig Bottom,‚Äù Savage quips back, ‚ÄúI've got two hands, yeah I can do it.‚Äù Kaff nonetheless maintained his fondness for Viv Savage over the years, telling BAM in 2011, ‚ÄúI played him very close to my heart‚Ä¶ just a little bit dimmer. If people like that character, chances are they'll like me.‚Äù Kaff won't appear in Reiner's forthcoming Spinal Tap sequel, but forever holds the distinction of delivering the original film's final line: ‚ÄúHave a good time all the time‚Äîthat's my philosophy, Marty.‚Äù Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
