                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 23-year-old American tennis star has jumped to World No. "It was such a remarkable experience for me, and making it to the first Grand Slam final and it being at Wimbledon was a surreal feeling," the 23-year-old said in a new interview with "Good Morning America." "Even though it didn't go the way I would have wanted it to go, my opponent obviously was was playing some great tennis, and I've had to compete against so many incredible athletes throughout the entire fortnight," she continued. 7 right now -- it's my career high and what a quick turnaround for me," she told "GMA." Anisimova added that there were larger takeaways, like having her family present and "getting to experience that moment with me," which she called "incredibly special." "Getting to meet Kate Middleton after the final at the ceremony, there were so many special moments and so many other things that I can take away apart from the performance in itself," she added. "The most important thing for me since coming back has honestly been doing everything on my own terms and just enjoying the moment," she said. "And that's what I told myself coming out into Wimbledon. I was just incredibly excited to just be playing in the main draw, because I didn't make it last year." Anisimova made history as the youngest American woman singles player to advance to the Wimbledon finals -- after defeating world No. "Getting to play on on Centre Court and winning against the most incredible athlete in tennis right now was super special to me and just an exhilarating feeling," she said. "It'll last me a lifetime of memories for sure." The iconic All England Lawn Tennis venue brought with it some very posh quirks, including champagne bottles popping mid-match that prompted officials to silence spectators. And then after the match, I was able to laugh about it afterwards, of course." It's always super exciting to be playing there, and I'm sure I'll have the whole home crowd cheering for me over there," she said. "Again, all of my family is going to come and support me -- I am sure it's going to be a great tournament. Sabalenka is the current defending women's singles U.S. Open champion. Anisimova has competed five times in the main draw. Her best U.S. Open finish was reaching the third round in 2020.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The menu was as elite as the guest list at Wimbledon's Champions' Dinner this year, with tennis royalty gathered in black tie at Raffles London at The OWO - a luxury hotel and event space in Whitehall, central London. The evening marked a glittering finale to a fortnight of tennis in SW19, where Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek were triumphant in the men's and women's singles events respectively. But before the dancing began, guests were treated to a decadent three-course meal. To start, diners enjoyed an Orkney scallop, paired with a pumpkin risotto, shavings of 24-month aged Parmesan, and a drizzle of rosemary chicken jus. The main course featured slow-cooked Hereford beef fillet, accompanied by potato dauphinoise, carrots, braised short rib, and a helping of red wine jus. Swiatek won the women's tournament in just 57 minutes, double-bageling American Amanda Anisimova in emphatic fashion on Saturday, to become the first Polish singles champion. Then on Sunday, Sinner took on double defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the second installment of a growing rivalry at the top of men's tennis, avenging his defeat from the French Open just over a month ago. Both stars were dressed for the occasion - Swiatek wore a glamourous lilac gown by Stella McCartney worth more than $2,000 (Â£1494). And Sinner, who is an ambassador for Italian fashion house Gucci, sported a custom dark suit and tie with a pair of the brand's signature loafers. The Italian revealed to BBC Sport how emotional he was after securing a memorable four-set victory over Alcaraz for his fourth major crown, describing it as 'the most amazing thing' that could have happened to him. '[It is] very emotional, even if I don't cry. Sinner's victory came just 10 weeks after he returned from a three-month ban following two positive tests for banned substance clostebol. 'It seems super surreal,' the now six-time Grand Slam champion admitted after her 6-0, 6-0 victory. 'Honestly, I didn't even dream of winning Wimbledon because it was way too far.</p>

On Monday, the Rafa Nadal Tennis Academy uploaded a series of Instagram video stories showcasing Zverev hitting at their flagship campus in Mallorca. During his post-match press conference, he opened up about feeling alone while struggling to dig himself out of a hole. Zverev is coming off a five-set, first-round loss to Arthur Rinderknech at Wimbledon. During his post-match press conference, he opened up about feeling alone while struggling to dig himself out of a hole. When asked whether the addition of a new coach was of consideration to assist with the situation, Zverev responded, âPossibly. As I said, it's a different feeling right now for me. I can't speak for the moment. But I think I'll have answers by Canada.âDespite the early departure in London, Zverev still stands at No. The 28-year-old, this year's Australian Open runner-up to Jannik Sinner, was originally slated to compete at the ATP 250 clay event in Kitzbuhel this week.âI've never felt this empty before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swiatek has just won Wimbledon, her sixth Grand Slam title and first since Roland Garros in 2024. This was another major tournament without a title for world number one Aryna Sabalenka, who was beaten by Amanda Anisimova in the semifinals. Now, former top 10 player Jack Sock has given his prediction about which of Swiatek and Sabalenka he thinks is more likely to win the US Open. Despite Swiatek's resurgent Wimbledon title victory, Sock actually believes Sabalenka is more likely to win the US Open this year. Sabalenka is the defending US Open champion, and Sock has suggested that she will be hungry to end her Grand Slam drought in 2025. âAll credit to Iga but I think I am probably going to ride with Sabalenka as the favourite for the US Open,â Sock said on the Nothing Major podcast. âI think she has proven on all surfaces she can play so big and dominant and blow women off the court in some of these matches with her aggressive play. And if not equal favourite for some of these. But I think Sabalenka will come out swinging and have a big purpose come New York and the US Open.â âI think she is definitely going to be talked about in that category again,â said Johnson. It felt like she hit it cross court 95% of the time and she was never going to miss and then ultimately just dominated with her backhand. It's such a weapon, especially on the women's side. You feel as if she is one of the only few women who are sliding on a grass court and moving like that.â After the match, Sabalenka admitted in her press conference that she made a mistake against Swiatek. âWell, she was just going for it,â Sabalenka said at the time. âEspecially, like, I gave her a lot of opportunities in the first few games. That is one of only two times that Swiatek has played Sabalenka at a Grand Slam, with the Belarusian getting revenge at Roland Garros this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zvereva bounced back well from her double bagel by Steffi Graf at Roland-Garros in 1988 and became the best doubles player in the world If Amanda Anisimova is looking for reasons to be positive after the harshness of her first Grand Slam final, then she could do worse than look at the experience of Natasha Zvereva, until Saturday, the only player in the Open era to suffer a 6-0, 6-0 defeat in a Grand Slam final. The American was understandably emotional after her double bagel against Iga Swiatek in the final at Wimbledon, but spoke well and promised to bounce back strongly. The American's fighting spirit and ball-striking were equally impressive, especially in her semi-final win over Aryna Sabalenka. Despite the loss, Amanda Anisimova's journey has been incredible.ð¾ Announced mental health break in May 2023ð¾ Lost in 2024 Wimbledon qualifying ranked No. But the experience of Zvereva in 1988 would also be worth her looking at. In 1988, Zvereva was just 17 when she reached the final at Roland-Garros, stunning Martina Navratilova on her way. In fact, she went on to reach at least the quarter-finals of all four slams, and made the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1998, beating Graf in the fourth round before losing in three sets to the eventual runner-up Nathalie Tauziat. Zvereva also became a brilliant doubles player, winning 80 titles in all, her partnership with Gig Fernandez one of the best of all time. Always good on grass, she reached the final of her very next tournament, in Eastbourne, and made the last 16 at Wimbledon. On hard courts in North America, she then beat Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver back to back to reach the final in Canada, losing out to Gabriela Sabatini in the final. So in terms of results, there was very little negative impact on Zvereva's career from that Roland-Garros defeat. Anisimova was right to emphasise the positives in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's loss, the American having never imagined she would make a slam final just a year after returning from a six-month break for mental health reasons. âObviously I really feel for Amanda today,â Radwanska told a small group of reporters. So I think it was still a great result for her. Hopefully she'll not be thinking about the result for a long time.â Short-term memory loss is a real strength, but if she needs some inspiration, Anisimova can at least look at Zverev and see what can be done. The American will be ranked a career-high No 7 now, which will ensure her some more favourable draws, in theory, and on hard courts, she should be a real threat. There are also many areas she can improve on and the way she spoke afterwards bodes well for her chances. âI mean, that's not an easy thing to go through, losing 0 and 0 in a Grand Slam final. (But) if anything, I can look at it as a positive and something I can look at as motivation going forward.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's dream of winning a third consecutive Wimbledon title came to an end on Sunday evening after losing to Jannik Sinner in the final. The Spaniard was no match for his long-time rival in their latest encounter, losing 6-4 4-6 4-6 4-6 on Centre Court. Alcaraz, who also lost to Sinner at Wimbledon in 2022, was ultimately out-performed by Sinner from the baseline and his usual drop-shot tactic did not work as effectively against the agile Italian. However, Alcaraz is already a five-time Grand Slam champion at 22 years of age, and he has another opportunity to win a major at the US Open in September. Jimmy Connors, a record-holder of five US Open titles, pinpointed a particular area of Alcaraz's pre-match routine before the Wimbledon final that he would not have done during his playing career. Jimmy Connors' opinions hold weight when it comes to tennis. An eight-time Grand Slam champion, Connors has a wealth of valuable experience to draw on and share with the wider population. âBut they were hugging seven or eight guys in their camp. To the point where I would have looked at that as a distraction. Despite losing on Sunday, Carlos Alcaraz can take great confidence heading into the US Open in August, a place where he is a former champion. Alcaraz had not lost any of his previous Grand Slam finals heading into Wimbledon, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in those finals. He has won three hard-court majors to Alcaraz's one, most recently capturing the 2025 Australian Open title.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former doubles world No 1 Rennae Stubbs has predicted that Novak Djokovic could call time on his legendary tennis career at the Australian Open. Djokovic was beaten in straight sets by eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the semi-final of Wimbledon last week, with the Serbian appearing to be hampered by an injury issue sustained in his quarter-final. âI would be sad, but hopefully it's not my last match on the Centre Court. âSo I'm planning to come back definitely at least one more time, play on the Centre Court for sure.â Despite Djokovic's insistence that he will return to Wimbledon in 2026, questions about his long-term future have lingered in recent days. Tennis legend John McEnroe questioned how willing the 38-year-old would be to remain a ânotch or twoâ below the likes of Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, and now six-time doubles Slam winner Stubbs has had her say. It has clearly been the best place for him to win a Grand Slam. âI thought his best chance was at Wimbledon, that has slipped away, but I think he probably almost feels that the Australian has been so mercurial in his life, he has had so many dramatic moments in his life, where he was treated very poorly by the Australian government. âSo it's an interesting dichotomy, but I think that is where he wants to finish his career, and that is where I think probably will be his last Grand Slam.â ATP Rankings battle for No 1 spot: When could Carlos Alcaraz overtake Jannik Sinner at the top? Jannik Sinner and Darren Cahill make coaching confession after Wimbledon title triumph Djokovic was beaten in the 2024 semi-final by eventual champion Sinner, his first defeat in an Australian Open semi-final, while he retired injured at the same stage versus Alexander Zverev this January. Alongside Sinner, the 38-year-old is one of just two men to reach the last four of every Grand Slam tournament this season, though he was also beaten by the Italian in straight sets at Roland Garros. He is a four-time champion at the tournament, but has not competed at the event since a third-round defeat back in 2018.

Both Sinner and ÅwiÄtek earned their maiden Wimbledon singles titles this year, making their joint appearance at the ball even more special. Sinner arrived in a classic black suit, crisp white shirt, and matching tie. As the top seed, the Italian outclassed a formidable field, taking out Luca Nardi, Aleksandar Vukic, Pedro MartÃ­nez, 19th seed Grigor Dimitrov, 10th seed Ben Shelton, and seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic, before avenging his Roland Garros defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the final. ÅwiÄtek, meanwhile, stunned spectators with a dominant run that culminated in a flawless 6-0, 6-0 win over Amanda Anisimova in the championship match. Dressed in a pearl blue Stella McCartney satin gown, the Polish star celebrated her sixth career Major and her first on grass, ending a year-long title drought. Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner both won their first-ever Wimbledon title this weekend ð pic.twitter.com/UbuAl1yD1A After the event, a now-viral video showed Sinner and ÅwiÄtek laughing and enjoying a dance together at the Champions' Ball. The delightful dance moment came to light when the BBC shared a behind-the-scenes video where Sinner opened up about how it all came together. âYes, I mean, we were there and in the beginning they told us that we, because it was quite late, that we don't have to do it,â Sinner said in the clip. Jannik Sinner says Iga Swiatek convinced him to do the Wimbledon Champions' dance: With the grass-court season behind them, Sinner and ÅwiÄtek will begin their hard-court campaigns at the 2025 Canadian Open, which will run from July 27 to August 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's no secret that Prince George is enthusiastic about an array of sports. He's accompanied his father, Prince William, to numerous football matches, and is also said to be a huge fan of rugby, scuba diving, and tennis. Ahead of the show-stopping tennis match between Jannik Sinner and defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz, Prince George made a rare public comment about his own racket skills. During a discussion with Wimbledon doubles champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, Cash asked George if he was any good at tennis, to which George replied: "I'm all right." The Princess has joined her family courtside on several occasions, with the youngster also securing a very special keepsake following this year's Championships. After the gripping match, footage showed sibling duo George and Charlotte chatting with Jannik. Charlotte held up two tennis balls, which the Wimbledon champ then proceeded to sign with his autograph. As she thanked the Italian athlete for signing their balls, saying: "Thank you so much, that's very kind of you," Charlotte handed him a third tennis ball for their younger brother Louis, who couldn't attend. "They've brought one for their brother as well," the Princess of Wales explained. The racket sport is also said to be a firm favourite of William and Kate's, though the royal couple have admitted that their competitive spirit can sometimes get in the way. During a previous appearance on Mike Tindall's The Good, The Bad and The Rugby podcast, Zara's husband jokingly said to Kate: "I'm not going to say you're uber competitive, butâ¦", which prompted Kate to reply: "I'm not competitive at all." Kate reportedly took tennis lessons at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham when she and Prince William lived at Kensington Palace. She also played doubles alongside Swiss great Roger Federer ahead of the 2023 Wimbledon tournament, and teamed up with British star, Emma Raducanu, in 2021 at a homecoming celebration, hosted by the Lawn Tennis Association. At the time, Emma said of Kate's tennis skills: "Her forehand was incredible. It was a lot of fun to play tennis with the Duchess."

The Spanish former world number two has worked her way back into the top 10 this year after a string of injuries, including a chronic lower back issue, had left her contemplating retirement.

Badosa lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 to Katie Boulter in the first round of Wimbledon earlier this month, and in a statement on Monday said she had suffered a tear in her psoas, the muscle which connects the lower back to the top of the leg.

"These are really challenging times for me but I'm staying hopeful that things will turn around soon and the light at the end of the tunnel will start to shine through," Badosa said, adding that the injury had occurred before Wimbledon.

Badosa is scheduled to play alongside Stefanos Tsitsipas in the US Open's revamped mixed doubles event, which will take place a week before the August 24 to September 7 singles main draw.</p>

It's that same fighting spirit she'll need to lean on more than ever in order to move beyond her last match of the tournament. Anisimova confronted Iga Swiatek in her first Grand Slam final and was beaten 6-0 6-0 by the Polish superstar, who improved her own record in Slam finals to a perfect 6-0. In her post-match press conference, Anisimova was realistic when analysing the defeat, yet determined to use the experience as an opportunity for growth. âIt was a bit tough to digest obviously, especially during and right after. It's not how I would have wanted my first Grand Slam final to go,â she said. I mean, that's not an easy thing to go through, losing 0 and 0 in a Grand Slam final. âIf anything, I can look at it as a positive and something I can look at as motivation going forward. Until that point of the tournament, Anisimova had enjoyed a brilliant run. She opened her own campaign with a 6-0 6-0 win over dangerous grasscourter Yulia Putintseva, then showed outstanding grit and fighting spirit to hold off Dalma Galfi and 30th seed Linda Noskova in back-to-back three setters to reach the quarterfinals. There, she survived a late fightback from Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to set up a semifinal with world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, whom she outplayed on Centre Court â in another intense three-set affair â to reach her first major final. Even before the nerves of a maiden Grand Slam final kicked in, she was already physically drained. The empty tank could have contributed to her serving performance; she landed less than half of her first serves and won just 26 per cent of first-serve points. Anisimova was clear all these areas of her game required attention as she moved forward. I think it's more experience for me on how to handle nerves. It's my first slam final, so at least I have that experience now. âI don't really know what was going on with my serveâ¦ I'm sure me and my team will get to the bottom of it. âTo honestly make it to the finals of Wimbledon with a mediocre serveâ¦ I obviously have to look back at film, but I feel like I've been fighting my way through with an average serve.â Her first WTA 1000 title in Doha, a trip to the fourth round at Roland Garros and a finals appearance at Queen's have been other highlights in 2025, during which Anisimova has won 31 of 44 matches. âWhen I got back to the locker room, I kind of had that switch in my mind of: âYou know what? This is probably going to make you stronger in the end,â Anisimova said, âand to not really put myself down after today and just try and focus on how I can come out stronger after this. âI think it's honestly, like, a fork in the road. âI think that's going to help me reach my goals.â</p>
