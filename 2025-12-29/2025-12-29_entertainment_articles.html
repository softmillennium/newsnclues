But there's one sequence the film that critics and audiences have singled out as a standout: the stomach-churning, incredibly suspenseful road chase along a winding desert highway path that serves as the film's tense climax. “The road, man,” Luke Lynch, editor of “BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions,” told “One Battle” editor Andy Jurgensen during IndieWire's Editors craft roundtables.

A funny thing happened when Netflix put the “Stranger Things” finale in theaters: Fans bought tickets. The AMC Kips Bay in New York City listed 11 screenings as “almost full” on New Year's Eve alone. (There are New Year's Day showings, as well.) The 34th Street theater filled up nine screenings, and Lincoln Square had five showings nearing capacity. Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, and more cities where the finale is playing saw similar demand, and all of these sales took place days before showtime. (These figures were tallied on Sunday, December 28.) By New Year's Eve, Netflix's latest “event” screenings should be even busier. Related Stories Here's What's Entering the Public Domain in 2026 All the ‘Stranger Things' Main Characters Should Live, Actually Now, this may not be surprising to some of you — “Stranger Things” is one of the most-watched properties on Netflix and has been for nearly a decade — but it took me off guard. So much of the discussion (online and off) around the last few seasons has skewed negative — egregious episode lengths, repetitive storytelling, lackluster thrills — I forgot that the silent majority either still likes what they're seeing or likes it enough to keep tuning in. That thousands of people will ring in the new year by watching TV at their local cineplex — despite its simultaneous availability at home, on the same platform where fans have watched every other episode — tells us just how popular the series remains. (And just how popular communal viewing experiences remain.) I doubt Netflix will announce exactly how well (or how poorly) “Stranger Things” does in its limited theatrical run, but even the anecdotal evidence supports an unconventional path forward for the series. Maybe what's next for the Hawkins gang isn't another series at all. Maybe they should stay in theaters long-term. OK, before unpacking that plan, I hear you: The finale hasn't even been released yet, so why are we jumping ahead to what's next? Well, because we know “Stranger Things” isn't really going to end with Season 5, Episode 8, “The Rightside Up.” Short-term, there's an animated spinoff, “Stranger Things: Tales from '85,” set to premiere in 2026. Long-term, “Stranger Things” is one of the few properties Netflix can even claim as a legitimate franchise. That's because it didn't last long.) Even if the Warner Bros. acquisition goes through, granting Netflix access to the studio's treasure trove of proven I.P., the surviving executives aren't simply going to forget about their old toys because they can now play with Batman and Superman. And believe me: I'd love it if they did forget. “Stranger Things” was originally conceived as a limited series, and each new season only underscored why its narrative wasn't meant for unlimited growth (personified quite well by the main cast's awkward, timeline-shattering growth spurts). Netflix has been churning out supplemental products in ancillary markets for years, and all of them — the books, games, even the Broadway show — feel like the secondary stories they are. It's too soon to say, but given it takes place “between Seasons 2 and 3,” I'm not holding my breath. So while contemplating what that franchise could look like — aka while staring down the barrel of watching (and reviewing) umpteen “Stranger Things” spinoffs, prequels, and side quests — I came to the (professionally convenient) conclusion that the series needs a reinvention. It shouldn't jump back to show us the origins of Hawkins Laboratory or “fill in the gaps” between preexisting seasons. It shouldn't launch a spinoff centered on Holly Wheeler or “Delightful” Derek. In other words, “Stranger Things” shouldn't become a universe. Their series is fueled by nostalgia, and that nostalgia largely stems from classic films like “E.T.,” “The Goonies,” and “Alien” (among many, many other influences). Their narrative structure can also skew closer to a long movie than a proper TV show, since seasons tend to distinguish themselves more clearly than episodes do. When trying to pinpoint a notable hourlong arc — not a moment or set piece, but an identifiable story contained within a single episode — my mind first went to the show's biggest flop (Season 2's “The Lost Sister,” in which the Duffer brothers tried their hands at a backdoor pilot). That catastrophe very much included, it often feels like the Duffers look down on television. They've repeatedly referred to their TV show as a movie, and they eschew TV terminology in describing “Stranger Things” whenever possible: Episodes are called “chapters,” and seasons are labeled like movie sequels. Seasons also don't appear to be their priority going forward. When the brothers moved their overall deal from Netflix to Paramount, they mentioned their “ambition to write, produce, and direct large-scale theatrical films.” Sure, the deal includes TV and streaming projects, too, but including this particular language in the official announcement sure sounds like they'll be concentrating on the big screen for a bit. Sure, what the Duffer brothers want may be beside the point — I won't pretend to know how to sort out the legal complications between their new deal with Paramount, Netflix's rights to “Stranger Things,” and its pending acquisition of Warner Bros. — but if we assume the creators will somehow be involved in the franchise moving forward, the case for moving forward with movies makes even more sense. Not only might movies spark the brothers' creative interest (in a way the last few seasons clearly haven't), but they could also reignite cultural interest. Call it wishful thinking, but aren't we tired of Hollywood's modern franchise playbook? Maybe it's a limited series that gets turned into an ongoing series, so long as the first season hits. Maybe it's a reboot that brings in a new cast, only to bring back the old cast when audiences are bored with the new one. People are exhausted with prequels; for every “Andor” there's an “Obi-Wan Kenobi” and a “Book of Boba Fett,” for every “House of the Dragon” there's a “Rings of Power” and “Dune: Prophecy.” Spinoffs aren't as out of favor at the moment, but their long TV history has taught us just how tricky they are to pull off; usually, the best ones require a revamp, like “Frasier” (after “Cheers”) or “The Good Fight” (after “The Good Wife”), or they're so formulaic, they just need to keep the train on the tracks (like your “NCIS” and “Chicago” shows). “Stranger Things” isn't really conducive to either tack. As much as Netflix would love to launch “Stranger Things: Normal, IL,” the series isn't rooted in a case-of-the-week structure — spinoffs will need their own narrative engines. And as much as Netflix loves spinoffs (“Wednesday,” “The Gentlemen,” “Queer Eye,” every new season of “Monster” — all of which are treated like new shows: accessible to anyone and everyone, with the added benefit of serving as a gateway drug to a preexisting properties), it's moving away from the risks typically required to make good ones. (We're still in the “gourmet cheeseburgers” era.) So rather than try to turn “Stranger Things” into something it isn't, or play by modern TV's rulebook for expanding a franchise, why not retreat to the relative safety of an old Hollywood strategy? (I'm sure many of them will be available for the right price.) Release a new entry every five years or so (to protect the brand and build anticipation the old-fashioned way — waiting). Plus, TV doesn't need more blockbusters, while movies (and theaters) still do. (No more new characters to fill out side quests that only exist to pad out an eight-hour season.) The movies can be movie-length without people complaining about two-hour “episodes,” and the narrative timeline can be adjusted to accommodate whoever comes back. Making sequels into movies also fits Netflix's presumed future (with Warner Bros.), and it fits the show's original inspirations. But most of all, movies feel like what “Stranger Things” has always wanted to be. After all, TV doesn't need more blockbusters, but movies — and theaters — still do. “Stranger Things” Season 5, Volume 3 — the series finale — premieres Wednesday, December 31 at 8 p.m. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron weighs in on Kathryn Bigelow's nuke thriller and explains why its cliffhanger ending was actually perfect. James Cameron made waves when he called Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer a “moral cop-out” for not depicting the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Netflix Drops First Look at 'Take That' Docuseries, Promising "Deeply Personal" Story of U.K. Boyband A House of Dynamite was directed by Kathryn Bigelow — Cameron's friend, former spouse and frequent collaborator — and the Avatar filmmaker tells The Hollywood Reporter that he had dinner with Bigelow just a few weeks ago and they discussed the ending. Continued Cameron: “But that's not even really the point. We cannot countenance these weapons existing at all. Cameron has used his work to warn about the threat of nuclear war going back to his 1984 feature debut, The Terminator. His films Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Abyss and True Lies also revolved around nuclear threats. Cameron promised Yamaguchi on his deathbed in 2010 that he'd make the film. On the subject of Oppenheimer, Cameron previously told Deadline, “it's interesting what he stayed away from. He's got one brief scene in the film where we see — and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film – but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him. I don't know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn't want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail.

List joins a cast that includes Casey Likes, Kuhoo Verma, Jackera Davis,  Elizabeth Teete, Kerry Butler, among others. Since beginning previews at New World Stages on June 22 and officially opening July 10, Heathers, directed by Andy Fickman, has broken the house record four times as well as building the largest advance in the venue's 21-year history. Matthew Broderick To Star In David Ireland's 'Ulster American' Off Broadway Rachel Dratch, Campbell Scott, Claybourne Elder & Wayne Brady Join New York City Center's Upcoming Encores! “Heather Chandler is an icon for a reason – she's larger than life, hilarious, terrifying, and deeply symbolic. Stepping into this role is thrilling, and I can't wait to enter my bad girl era. The series returns for its third season this month. On Netflix's Cobra Kai, which ended its sixth and final season as one of Netflix's most popular series earlier this year, List played Tory Nichols. Previously, List played Emma Ross on Disney Channel's Jessie before reprising the character in the spinoff series Bunk'd. Other television credits include Hulu's supernatural thriller Light as a Feather, the dystopian feature The Thinning, and CBS' Happy Together. Heathers has had three West End productions and three tours, which have broken box office records throughout the UK and Ireland. The synopsis: Welcome to Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death, and Veronica Sawyer is just another nobody dreaming of a better day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The BBC's most famous fringe is coming to a sofa near you. Deadline can reveal that The Claudia Winkleman Show has been officially commissioned and will launch next spring. Broadcast information and guests will be revealed “in due course.” 'The Traitors' Host Alan Cumming To Present 2026 BAFTA Film Awards Jeremy Clarkson Says He Doesn't Believe 'The Traitors' Gameplay Is Real We revealed that the long-gestating chat show was being produced by The Graham Norton Show maker So Television and Little Arrow in October. Those plans, we understand, will see Winkleman's series broadcast when The Graham Norton Show is off-air in the spring, meaning there will be no clashes between the shows and they will not be competing for guests. The BBC recently renewed The Graham Norton Show for another three years, while its recent run of episodes has boasted eye-catching bookings including Taylor Swift. Winkleman  earned her chat show stripes by stepping in for Norton earlier this year when the Irish presenter was on a break from his BBC duties. ITV Studios-backed So Television has made more than 550 episodes of his Friday night talk show since 2007. “Claudia is a true national treasure – warm, witty and endlessly entertaining,” said BBC commissioning editor Kalpna Patel-Knight. “She has an extraordinary ability to put people at ease and bring out the very best in them, whether they're global superstars or members of the audience.” Winkleman's star has soared since hosting the first season of The Traitors in 2022 and its celebrity spin-off several weeks back. She will have more time on her hands, however, now that she has presented her final episode of Strictly Come Dancing, the BBC Saturday night juggernaut that she has fronted with Tess Daly since 2010. Winkleman has been in the press overnight teasing “truly extraordinary” twists and “hardcore” round tables for the murder mystery reality series, with a red-cloaked figure keeping fans guessing. So Television Managing Director Graham Stuart added: “Graham Norton has made the Friday night talk show slot a dazzling appointment to view. So Television's co-production partner on Winkleman's chat show, Little Arrow, is the management and production company launched by Winkleman's agent, Holly Bott, in July 2024. Executive producers on The Claudia Winkleman Show are Stuart and Ruth Phillips. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lisa Rinna had a long run on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” but it could have been even longer. The former RHOBH cast member revealed in a recent interview that she auditioned for the first season of the Bravo reality show in 2010, but that Andy Cohen stopped her from being hired. “I was up for Housewives season one,” Rinna, 62, revealed on the “Skinny Confidential Him & Her Show.” “I went in for casting. And  Andy said, ‘I don't want any actresses on the show.' “Season five, when I came in, he decided to let actresses come, and they hired me and Eileen Davidson,” the former “Days of Our Lives” star continued. “So it did change the game because we came in as soap actors, like together.” Rinna added that she “only” had fun with Davidson, who appeared on three seasons of the show. She announced her exit from the show in January 2023. Cohen, who serves as an executive producer on Bravo's “Real Housewives” franchise, said Rinna had “an iconic run” on RHOBH, according to People magazine. “I actually have mixed feelings about having stars on the show,” Cohen told The Hollywood Reporter in a May 2024 interview. “When Lisa Rinna was trying out for Season 1 of ‘Beverly Hills,' I was very much against the idea. But then she came, and it made perfect sense.” “First, you've gotta give props to Lisa Rinna for being, by the way, eight years,” said Cohen. ‘[She] has been really a huge part of ‘Beverly Hills,'” he added. “I really do hope that this is a pause. …I just hope that Lisa will humor us and comes back. …I  do hope that this is a pause, because I always enjoyed Lisa Rinna on my TV.” Despite being behind some of RHOBH's messiest scenes, Rinna has been very adamant that her days as a Bravo star are done. In a 2024 interview on “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” Rinna said she would “never” return to the “Real Housewives” after leaving on her own terms.

All I had to do is stay away from my family.” But that carefully erected barrier crumbles when his parents, Hal (Bryan Cranston) and Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), insist their middle child attend their 40th wedding anniversary party. The new teaser doesn't give much away in terms of plot, though it is filled with plenty of hijinks: a pink-clad army toting confetti cannons, Malcolm hiding from Lois in a bathroom stall, and Hal bashing some poor guy over the head with what looks like a typewriter. There's also a glimpse at one of the reboot's new dynamics, between Malcolm and his own teenage daughter (Keeley Karson), who encourages her dad to reunite with his family.

When the Grammy winner continued to stand there silently, Cole joked they were having a “good, healthy conversation.” The “Average Joe” star then asked West if he had any forthcoming projects audience members should be “looking out for,” to which the Yeezy founder replied, “New album coming out.” Cole then joked that he would like to be featured on an interlude on West's new album, also asking whether he could be sent a care package of clothing. Cole shared a video of the moment via Instagram, with fans labeling the back and forth “AWKWARD AF.” Start your day with Page Six Daily.

The three-part limited series, arriving Jan. 27, will feature 35 years of rare archive and new interviews with members Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen.

	“Nothing beats being in a band,” says Gary Barlow in a new clip from Netflix‘s Take That docuseries.


	The streaming giant has released a first-look clip — showing the band backstage ahead of a gig in the '90s — and images from its three-part limited series, set to drop Jan. 27.




	In Take That, viewers are taken behind the scenes with members Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen, Jason Orange, and Robbie Williams as they reveal their personal experiences in a band that captivated millions of fans, playing sold-out shows, topping the charts with 12 huge U.K. No. 1 hit singles and selling over 45 million records worldwide.

	Featuring 35 years of rare archive, never-before-seen footage and personal material, as well as brand new interviews with Barlow, Donald and Owen, the series promises to offer an “intimate look at the highs, the heartbreaks, and the enduring legacy of one of the U.K.'s most successful bands of all time.”


	“From their early beginnings as [a] five piece formed in Manchester to becoming pop superstars, relive the camaraderie, chaos, and resilience that fueled their meteoric rise, dramatic split, and one of the greatest comebacks in British music history,” says a plot synopsis. “Told in their own words, this is the deeply personal and definitive story of Take That.”

	











	Produced by Fullwell Entertainment, Take That is directed by David Soutar (Bros: After the Screaming Stops, Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All) and is executive produced by Gabe Turner.

The post appeared to be in response to a festive photo shared earlier in the week by her younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, which showed Jamie Lynn celebrating the holiday with her husband Jamie Watson, daughters Maddie, 17, and Ivey, 7, as well as their mother Lynne Spears and Britney's son Sean Preston Federline. In a separate line within the same post, Spears directly referenced her niece Ivey, writing, “Hello, beautiful Ivey… I just want to hold you, my love… Godspeed, friends.” According to People, Spears spent Christmas Day with her younger son, Jayden James Federline, 19. Spears shares Jayden and Sean with her ex-husband, Kevin Federline. Since its termination, Spears has repeatedly spoken — often through social media — about the emotional toll of that period and her fractured relationships with relatives involved in the arrangement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NewJeans' long-awaited full-group return has hit another obstacle after their agency, ADOR, terminated member Danielle Marsh's exclusive contract, complicating plans for the K-pop group's reunion. The agency said it determined Danielle could no longer continue as both a NewJeans member and a company artist following recent legal rulings and internal discussions. The announcement comes as ADOR works to stabilize the group after more than a year of legal disputes that stalled NewJeans' activities and placed their future in question. Once seen as one of K-pop's most promising global acts, the group now faces renewed uncertainty just as a comeback appeared possible. A Seoul court ruled earlier this fall that NewJeans' exclusive contracts with ADOR remain legally binding, according to The Korea Herald. The agency also said Minji remains in talks and has not finalized her position. ADOR said it formally terminated her contract after concluding that continued collaboration was no longer possible. In its statement, ADOR also said it plans to pursue legal action against a member of Danielle's family and former ADOR chief executive Min Hee-jin, whom the agency accused of contributing to the prolonged conflict that delayed NewJeans' return. The contract termination surprised many fans, particularly after earlier reports suggested all five members had expressed interest in returning to ADOR after the court decision. Danielle, along with Minji and Hanni, had previously been included in discussions about restoring full-group activities, according to Forbes. Industry observers say the loss of a founding member could complicate future releases, branding, and tour plans, especially given the group's strong identity as a five-member act. ADOR has not announced a timeline for NewJeans' next release or performance. With negotiations ongoing and legal tensions unresolved, the group's path forward remains unclear.
