                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florian Wirtz has been placed on a ‘special bulk programme' as Liverpool's summer signing continues to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League. After enduring a tough start to his journey in England following his £116million ($156.5m) summer arrival, the Germany international finally opened his account in the Premier League last weekend as he scored the winning goal against Wolves. The German attacking midfielder had an underwhelming start to his journey in the Premier League after Liverpool broke the bank to sign Wirtz for a then-British record transfer fee from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer transfer window. After his initial struggles in Merseyside, the Liverpool coaching staff placed Wirtz on a special programme to bulk up in order to match the intensity of the Premier League, according to the Daily Mail. The hard shifts in the gym and intense weight training have clearly paid off as Wirtz has gained two kilograms in weight and was seen at the very best of his abilities against Wolves at Anfield last weekend. Liverpool fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief that Wirtz has found his old form from Germany and is now ready to light up the Premier League. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. After Wirtz's heroics at Anfield, Reds boss Arne Slot had told Sky Sports: "The team have seen how much he (Wirtz) did already for us, creating chances and being so close to a goal. He will go on and score many more goals than one for us. I think Florian did more than only score today." I wanted to start earlier scoring and assisting but it was like this and I have to accept it. I just know that it will come and I try to keep going like that. We lost the game and got it back. In the last 20 minutes, we made it a bit difficult. That's how we want to do it. It's not been an easy start for us but we're doing better and getting the points." Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk also showered the youngster with praise as he said: "I was very happy for him. Everyone was outstanding in the first half. He's getting used to playing for Liverpool and what we want to do as a team. He's getting used to the intensity. After about 70 minutes I think he had some cramp. He just has to keep going. It was an important goal for us and now on to New Year's Day. He's a very intelligent player who is so comfortable on the ball. He finds space between the lines and can be very important. "He wants to be important in terms of goals and assists. The work rate he puts in and the chances he creates is what I think is even more important. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Wirtz will now aim to push forward in 2026 and play a decisive role reminiscent of his price tag in Liverpool's push for silverware come the end of the season. His Anfield career is still in its infancy and there will be many more opportunities for the playmaker to affect games in the Premier League and show just why he was one of the most sought-after players in world football over the summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In some instances, ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup are five times more expensive than in the previous tournament in Qatar in 2022, prompting swift and severe backlash from fans all over the world. “We have six to seven million tickets on sale,” Infantino said via BBC Sport. “And in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests. So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is. “In the almost 100 years of the World Cup, FIFA has sold 44 million tickets in total. So, in two weeks we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. The high prices will make going to stadiums across the United States, Canada and Mexico during the World Cup for a once in a generation event simply unaffordable for fans. FIFA's response to the backlash was to open a new, restricted tier of tickets at $60 for every game. It's no secret that FIFA will get a massive piece of the World Cup ticket pie. Speaking on the matter, Infantino made sure to detail where FIFA will be reinvesting the revenue from its handsome slice. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup which we reinvest all over the world.” Only time will tell if Infantino's repeated promise to help the sport develop all over the world becomes a concrete reality. What's certain is that the economic revenue generated from World Cup ticket sales could make a significant impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo has expressed his determination to score 1,000 goals by the end of his career. And the 40-year-old Portugal superstar is in no doubt he'll get there. "I will reach that number for sure, if no injuries," Ronaldo said late Sunday at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, where he was named as the best player in the Middle East. Ronaldo moved onto 956 career goals by scoring twice for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League on Saturday. His tally includes men's international record of 143 goals for Portugal, which Ronaldo is set to lead into next year's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. "I am still very motivated to carry on," the former Real Madrid, Manchester United and Juventus striker said on stage after receiving his award. "You know what my goal is: I want to win more trophies and I want to reach the number that you will all know." He won the European Championship with Portugal in 2016.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Competing in this year's Champions League while pushing for qualification to next year's European competition, the Blues are in a battle for a top five spot in the domestic standings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA president Gianni Infantino has claimed that World Cup ticket revenue is necessary for sustaining football in 150 countries. After widespread backlash to general ticket prices and those for fans of participating member associations (PMAs), released on December 11, FIFA introduced the “supporter entry tier” five days later, which offers around 1,000 tickets per game for $60 to supporters of the two competing teams. At the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday, Infantino spoke publicly for the first time since those ticket prices were announced. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup, which we reinvest all over the world.” As a matter of fact, FIFA expects to reinvest more than 90 per cent of its budgeted investments for the cycle 2023-2026 back in the game to significantly boost global football development. For example, the average price across Category 1-3 prices released by FIFA earlier this month for games involving Germany in the group stage was $422. It shows how powerful the World Cup is. So, in two weeks, we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. A press release from FIFA later on Monday repeated Infatino's claim, stating that “over 150 million ticket requests have been submitted to date by fans from over 200 countries.” The “random selection draw” ticketing phase that opened on December 11 will conclude January 13. FIFA then randomly selects an unknown number of applicants, charges them the listed price before they are given their requested tickets at some point on or after February 5. Any remaining tickets will be sold on a “first-come-first-served” basis. Sam Joseph  is a Junior News Editor at The Athletic, based in London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fulham have their sights set on bringing U.S. men's national team forward Ricardo Pepi to Craven Cottage this winter, a report claims. Mexico national team talisman Raúl Jiménez, who is set to turn 35 in May, only has five goals to his name in 2025–26, while Rodrigo Muniz has been sidelined since November with a hamstring injury. According to Daily Mail, Fulham view Pepi as an exciting reinforcement for Marco Silva's squad, one that would bring a spark of life to a frontline that has only scored two or more goals in four of the club's last 16 games. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. The Cottagers were previously interested in the American last summer, while West Ham United made an offer a year ago. Pepi has already found the back of the net 10 times in 21 appearances, on pace to shatter his previous personal-best production of 17 goals in a single campaign. The Dutch club is thought to value the 22-year-old at around $54 million, a price tag that could keep increasing should Pepi keep up his form into 2026. Fulham not only would have to splash some serious cash to snag his signature, but also convince the No. Pepi missed significant time last season due to a knee injury, keeping him sidelined for the majority of the USMNT's 2025 calendar year. His lengthy stay in the infirmary opened the door for Haji Wright and Patrick Agyemang to impress new boss Mauricio Pochettino instead. Pepi's return to top form, though, gives Pochettino a welcome problem. Now the Argentine has a wealth of options up top to test out during the March international break against Belgium and Portugal.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Demand for the 2026 FIFA World Cup isn't just high, it's record-breaking.

On Monday, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that with just 7 million tickets available, more than 150 million ticket requests have been received. This interest represents “3.4 times more than the overall number of spectators who have attended the 964 matches that make up all 22 editions of the competition combined since 1930.”

For those still looking to get their hands on tickets, the current Random Selection Draw phase lasts through Jan. 11, 2026. Fans have an equal chance at receiving tickets through this draw, but will be able to buy tickets in future draws if they are unsuccessful. 

Ticket prices are divided into tiers, including the new Supporter Entry Tier that offers $60 tickets at each match. It was created in response to backlash over unaffordable ticket prices.

“The FIFA World Cup 2026 is set to be the greatest and most inclusive show on the planet, with more than 150 million tickets already requested in only the first 15 days, making this edition 30 times oversubscribed - a true showcase of incredible demand from fans from over 200 countries,” said Infantino.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The veteran Polish forward, who will soon enter the final six months of his current contract, has yet to decide on his future at Barcelona and has not penned a fresh extension yet. Lewandowski, whose contract is nearing its expiry, has acknowledged that no clear decision has yet been made over whether his journey in Catalonia will continue beyond the 2025-26 campaign after overcoming a few injury issues this year. While speaking to Polish journalist Bogdan Rymanowski earlier this month, Lewandowski offered a candid assessment of his situation, revealing both reflection and restraint. He said: "I still have time to make a decision. "I am not talking to the coach about interested clubs," he added. A lot depends on the club's plan and what I want." As Lewandowski's future remains uncertain, Barcelona have begun their search for the Polish forward's replacement. According to Marca, the Catalan giants have reportedly identified Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic as a like-for-like replacement of Lewandowski. While Hansi Flick considers Ferran Torres to be a perfect option to replace Lewandowski in his starting lineup, the club would also want someone to bolster the attack and fill the hole left by Lewandowski's departure next summer. He also suffered an abductor injury only a month back and won't return to action at least until the first match of 2026.

Chelsea loanee Nicolas Jackson might leave Bayern Munich next summer once his loan deal expires, as the Bavarian giants are unlikely to make his move permanent. With Jackson's future uncertain, the German champions have begun to look elsewhere and Fabrizio Romano claimed that Bayern held talks in October with representatives of Juventus striker Vlahovic. The 25-year-old Serbian forward is considered a strong candidate and will likely be a more affordable option, particularly given his contract is set to expire next summer.

According to Spanish outlet AS, his agent Pini Zahavi is set to hold fresh talks with officials from the Saudi Pro League ahead of the January transfer window. The Saudi Pro League has already lured some of the sport's most recognisable names, including Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad's Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante. Earlier this month, the BBC reported that Lewandowski's representatives had also held discussions with Chicago Fire over a possible move to Major League Soccer. Chicago Fire have made no secret of their desire to sign a global star and are believed to have identified Lewandowski as a priority target for several months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA president Gianni Infantino has defended the exorbitant cost of World Cup tickets, described by fan groups as 'scandalous'. Tickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup. The cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from supporters. 'We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,' argued Infantino at the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday. It shows how powerful the World Cup is. So, in two weeks we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup which we reinvest all over the world.' After the enormous backlash from fans at the pricing, FIFA did guarantee a small selection of tickets would be available at a reduced cost of £45, thought to be around 10 per cent of the overall allocation handed to each nation taking part. In England's case, the tickets – which will be available for all games - will go to members of the official supporters' club. While the figure is relatively small, the move represents a significant victory for campaigners and fans. A FIFA spokesperson said: 'Fans of the national teams that have qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2026 will benefit from a dedicated ticket pricing tier, which has been designed to make following their teams on football's greatest stage more affordable. That means for the opener against Croatia in Dallas, they will be given 4,000 in total with 400 available at £45. However, there are more than 600 ‘top cappers', the highest tier in the group, so FA bosses will have to decide how to distribute them. A ballot is thought to be most likely. ‘Loyalty has been thrown out of the window and supporters of the participating nations have been completely let down', they added. Football Supporters' Europe went further, saying they were ‘astonished by the extortionate ticket prices imposed by FIFA on the most dedicated supporters for next year's FIFA World Cup'.</p>

The Johnson County Parks and Recreation District wants artists from across the Kansas City region to help create flags for the 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer celebration. They're using an unexpected material – fabric from a decommissioned hot air balloon. JCPRD is seeking 10 local artists who will each design four flags measuring three by six feet. Flags have long served as symbols that bring people together and celebrate cultures worldwide, and Angi Hejduk from JCPRD says that was important to the project. "The idea of public art as part of FIFA World Cup 2026 is that it was so easy to lean so directly into a soccer theme, versus using it as an opportunity to highlight the incredible artistry that exists in the Kansas City Metro Area," says Hejduk, JCPRD public arts specialist. Hejduk said this also aims to bridge the gap between the art community and sports, giving artists and opportunity to contribute to events where they might not traditionally see their role. Applications for interested artists are currently open and will remain available through January 11.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dominic Calvert-Lewin will offer Thomas Tuchel 'something different' at the World Cup. That is the view of talkSPORT's Darren Ambrose as he backed calls for the Leeds United striker to receive an England re-call. Calvert-Lewin is currently the highest-scoring Englishman in the Premier League ahead of next summer's World Cup. Discussing his current form, Ambrose told The Final Word: "He's got seven in his last six, but he has eight this season. His last appearance for the Three Lions came in July 2021 against Ukraine in the quarter-finals of that tournament. However, Tuchel's options up front appear lacking behind all-time leading scorer Harry Kane. Asked if there is a chance Calvert-Lewin goes to the World Cup, Ambrose added: "Yes, I certainly think there is. "If you look at the forwards that they have. "You've got Ollie Watkins, you've got Dominic Solanke, where that guy is I don't know. You don't even get updates about Dominic Solanke anymore." Dominic Solanke has been limited to just two league appearance for Tottenham Hotspur this season due to injury. Meanwhile, Ollie Watkins' brace against Chelsea on Saturday took his tally to five in 18 league outings for Aston Villa this term. The depth in attack is a concern for Rory Jennings, who admitted: "I feel like the drop off from Harry Kane to whoever we have to go for is stark." Ambrose believes this helps Calvert-Lewin's case as he argued: "Dominic Calvert-Lewin offers you something different to Harry Kane. "The goal he scored today, it was instinct.
