Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., defends her COVID-era MEALS Act amid USDA fraud allegations, telling Fox News Digital she doesn't regret the bill. A pair of companies owned by Tim Mynett, the husband of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., have exploded in value in recent years, growing more than 20 times in under a year, according to congressional disclosures, prompting questions about how the companies achieved their apparent rapid success. It's a picture that contrasts bleakly with mounting revelations of fraud in Minnesota as investigations indicate the losses through abuse of government programs could top $9 billion. Ballpark revelations about Omar's assets show a steep increase in the value of her husband's company holdings since 2020. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she has "absolutely" no regrets about the 2020 MEALS Act because "it did help feed kids." Omar disclosed 2024 evaluations of Rose Lake Capital LLC, a business firm co-founded by her husband, at somewhere between $5 million and $25 million in 2024. Just one year before, in 2023, she reported that the same company's value was between $1 and $1,000. Congressional disclosures, categorized in ranges of value, don't provide the precise details of how much a member's holdings are worth. The company roster of employees included an impressive cast of figures like Adam Ereli — a lobbyist and former ambassador to Bahrain under the Obama administration. Mynett, Omar's third husband, co-founded the company in 2022. With mounting public pressure on Omar surrounding multi-billion fraud schemes in Minnesota — and questions about whether the congresswoman could have benefited from them — the company has since stripped its website of all its team member names and bios. It's unclear if any of them remain affiliated with the company. Omar's office did not respond to a request for comment about the company's growth or why it removed the names of its employees. It was evaluated at just $15,000 to $50,000 the year before. Despite its increased evaluation, the company's portal for purchasing wine doesn't appear to work. The company also lacks a recent social media footprint, with its last post having gone up in January 2023. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is facing pressure to answer questions over the rampant fraud in Minnesota. The phone number displayed on its website also is not in operation. Omar's office did not respond to a request for comment about the evaluations of either company. Leo Briceno is a politics reporter for the congressional team at Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and rocket troops to conduct joint military drills around the island of Taiwan, a move Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces.

In this image taken off video, a Taiwan fighter jet prepares to land at the Hsinchu Airbase in Taiwan on Monday, Dec. 29, 2025. In this image taken off video, Sun Li-fang, Taiwan Defense Ministry spokesperson speaks about China's latest military drills during a press conference in Taipei, Taiwan on Monday, Dec. 29, 2025. HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.” Taiwan's aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions. The drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan's prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule. China's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party's targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said. Shi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland's government claims it as sovereign territory. China's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. “Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them. The Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added. Commercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China. Last week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. Under U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter's administration recognized and established relations with Beijing. Asked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted “to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.” There was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills. “Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base. The military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,” during a trip to Shanghai.</p>

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins 'Fox News Live' reacting to China and Russia's public condemnation of U.S. military pressure against Venezuela as oil tanker blockades continue to impact their economies. China on Monday launched its largest military exercises ever around Taiwan, surrounding the island with warships, aircraft and live-fire drills as tensions spiked following a record U.S. arms sale to Taipei. The drills, known as "Justice Mission 2025," involve coordinated deployments of ground forces, naval vessels, fighter jets, drones and artillery across seven maritime zones encircling Taiwan. China's Eastern Theater Command said the exercises include simulated strikes on land and sea targets and rehearsals to blockade Taiwan's main ports, a scenario analysts say would be central to any attempt to isolate or coerce the island. Live-fire exercises are scheduled to continue through Tuesday, with China designating large danger zones for artillery firing closer to Taiwan than in any previous round of drills. The scope of the operation has already disrupted civilian air and sea traffic, forcing airlines to reroute flights and Taiwan's aviation authority to plan alternative airspace corridors. Chinese military officials defended the exercises as a response to separatism and foreign involvement. Beijing denounced the deal, warning it risks turning Taiwan into a "powder keg" and driving the region toward "military confrontation and war." China launched its largest military exercises ever around Taiwan on Monday. The package includes 82 HIMARS rocket launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, giving Taiwan a new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait. It also includes 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced unmanned aerial vehicle systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed." As the drills unfolded, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said 89 Chinese military aircraft, 14 naval vessels and 14 coast guard ships were operating around the island, with additional warships spotted farther out in the Western Pacific. Some Chinese vessels were engaged in close stand-offs with Taiwanese ships near the island's contiguous zone, about 24 nautical miles from shore. "Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait … would not only constitute military pressure on us, but could also pose more complex challenges and impacts for the international community and neighboring countries," Hsieh Jih-sheng, Taiwan's deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence, told reporters. Taiwan placed its military on high alert and said it was prepared to conduct rapid response exercises if the drills escalated. The defense ministry released a video highlighting its own capabilities, including U.S.-made HIMARS systems, while the coast guard deployed large patrol ships to monitor Chinese vessels near its waters. Chinese state media said the exercises focus on sealing off Taiwan's key deep-water ports, including Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, reinforcing concern that Beijing is refining blockade options short of an outright invasion. A screen in Beijing displays China's live-fire drills. China also released propaganda videos and posters alongside the drills, including footage depicting automated humanoid robots, swarms of micro-drones and weaponized robotic dogs attacking the island, as well as imagery appearing to show civilian vessels that analysts say could support an amphibious assault. "I think these drills are just meant to scare us," said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher in Taipei. "Similar drills have happened before … the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan's current government and how they choose to respond." China claims Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Across the country this year, fugitives on the run turned quiet neighborhoods, rural towns and college campuses into crime scenes. Five major manhunts, each chaotic in its own way, sent police scrambling, triggered lockdowns and highlighted how quickly suspects can disappear. Ten inmates, including several accused of murder, escaped through a hole behind a toilet at Orleans Justice Center in the early morning hours of May 16, triggering a monthslong, multi-agency manhunt across Louisiana and beyond. The inmates taunted authorities on their way out, leaving handwritten messages on the cell wall, including one that read, "To easy LOL." New Orleans jail escapee Gary Price is escorted to a helicopter by police who captured him. Jail staff did not realize the inmates were missing until about 8:30 a.m., hours after the escape, officials later acknowledged during a City Council meeting. "First of all, that jail had been deemed a train wreck in terms of just basic jail operations," former federal prison Warden Cameron Lindsay previously told Fox News Digital. "It would appear that basic security inspections were not taking place. Inmates should never be able to tear a toilet off a wall and go straight to the perimeter fence. By October, all 10 escapees had been captured, but the incident triggered intense scrutiny of jail oversight and leadership. Former police chief and convicted killer Grant Hardin, 56, slipped out of the Calico Rock prison on May 25 by disguising himself as a corrections officer — a breach made possible when a guard mistook him for staff. Nicknamed the "Devil in the Ozarks," Hardin escaped through a sally port wearing a makeshift Arkansas Department of Correction-style uniform, prison officials said, noting it was not an official uniform. Grant Hardin allegedly used a black marker and soup can to disguise himself before escaping prison. After submitting DNA samples when he was booked for the murder case, his DNA was linked to the 1997 cold-case rape of a teacher. I mean, this guy is a sociopath," survivalist Shawn Hendrix previously told Fox News Digital. "[Hardin] has no care for humans or anybody but himself. … I would not want to be out looking for this guy." "Thanks to the great work of local, state and federal law enforcement, Arkansans can breathe a sigh of relief and I can confirm that violent criminal Grant Hardin is back in custody," Gov. "I am grateful for all law enforcement who contributed to his capture and give special thanks to the Trump administration and Secretary Kristi Noem, who sent a team from Border Patrol that was instrumental in tracking and apprehending Hardin." After murdering his three daughters, Travis Caleb Decker vanished into rural Washington state, setting off one of the largest manhunts Chelan County has ever seen. Investigators began searching for Decker in late May after he failed to return his daughters, Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5, to their mother following a scheduled visitation. The children's bodies were later found near Rock Island Campground along Icicle Creek with bags over their heads. An Army veteran with extensive survival training, Decker managed to evade capture as teams from multiple counties and federal agencies combed vast stretches of wilderness. His remains were eventually discovered in September, bringing the manhunt to a close. "To Whitney, we apologize it's taken this long to get the closure we were looking for in this case," Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison said in a news conference, referring to Decker's ex-wife and the mother of the three slain girls. "But I hope you can rest easier at night knowing Travis is accounted for. A deadly mass shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda left four people dead on Aug. 1, prompting a weeklong, multi-agency manhunt through rugged terrain after the suspected gunman fled the scene. Authorities identified 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. Army soldier, as the suspect in the fatal quadruple homicide and said he was tracked for days before being taken into custody about five-and-a-half miles from the crime scene, near a barn west of Anaconda. During the search, officials warned Brown was armed and extremely dangerous as law enforcement expanded operations across steep, heavily wooded areas. The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, where Michael Paul Brown allegedly killed four people. Greg Gianforte praised the coordinated response of local, state and federal authorities at a news briefing, saying officers "didn't waste a second" in the effort to locate the suspect. Attorney General Austin Knudsen said approximately 130 personnel assisted in the manhunt and credited community tips with helping lead investigators to Brown. The victims were identified as Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64; David Allen Leach, 70; and Tony Wayne Palm, 74, all residents of Anaconda. Investigators said Brown initially fled the bar on foot and was later believed to be using a stolen vehicle, allowing him to evade capture for several days before his arrest. Some residents told Fox News Digital they had previously described Brown as volatile, with individuals saying they warned neighbors he might "snap" before the shooting. A deadly classroom attack inside Brown University's Barus and Holley engineering building killed two students and wounded nine others during a finals-week review session on Dec. 13, triggering a massive multi-agency manhunt. A split image shows Claudio Neves-Valente, identified as the Brown University gunman, wearing the same jacket as a man identified earlier as a person of interest in the case. The victims were identified as Ella Cook, a vice president of the College Republicans from Birmingham, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an aspiring neurosurgeon from Virginia. Authorities later identified 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a Portuguese national, as the suspected gunman. He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, during the search. Investigators believe he was also responsible for the fatal shooting of an MIT professor days later. The manhunt and its aftermath left campuses nationwide reexamining safety measures, as investigators worked to retrace Neves-Valente's movements using surveillance video, public tips and physical evidence.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing criticism after he welcomed home a recently released Egyptian prisoner who allegedly posted violent and antisemitic language on his social media in the past. Successive British governments have pushed for the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a dual British Egyptian national who had been behind bars in Egypt for most of the last 14 years. He was released from prison in September following a pardon by the Egyptian president, but remained in the country under a travel ban that was only recently lifted, allowing him to return to the U.K. on Friday. Starmer celebrated Abd el-Fattah's return by saying he was "delighted" that the activist had been reunited with his family in Britain. Pro-democracy activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah after he received a presidential pardon. Meanwhile, a senior member of the opposition Conservative Party criticized Starmer for giving a "personal, public endorsement" to Abd el-Fattah. Robert Jenrick, the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor, wanted to know whether Starmer was aware of past social media posts in which Abd el-Fattah allegedly endorsed killing Zionists and police. Jenrick also demanded that Starmer condemn Abd el-Fattah's remarks and withdraw his "unalloyed endorsement" of the activist. "Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily nor for peaceful dissent," Jenrick wrote. Jenrick, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have called for Abd el-Fattah's British citizenship to be revoked and for him to be deported. Prime Minister Keir Starmer celebrated Alaa Abd el-Fattah's return by saying he was "delighted" that the activist had been reunited with his family in Britain. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement that it had been "a long-standing priority" of governments under both major parties to push for Abd el-Fattah's release, but it said that does not imply an endorsement of his social media posts. Abd el-Fattah issued an "unequivocal apology" on Sunday, describing his past comments as the "expressions of a young man's anger" during regional crises and police brutality in Egypt. The U.K. government said it considers Alaa Abd el-Fattah's social media posts to be "abhorrent." Abd el-Fattah's family in the U.K. had argued that he spent most of the past 14 years behind bars because of his opposition to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's government. Shortly after Abd el-Fattah arrived at London's Heathrow Airport, critics began circulating his past social media posts. Abd el-Fattah has previously said the comments were taken out of context and were part of a "private conversation" that happened during an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip, according to The Times of London.

The Interoceanic Train linking the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz went off the rails Sunday as it passed a curve near the town of Nizanda. (AP Video shot by Janet Cabrera) MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AP) — Officials said a train accident in southern Mexico killed at least 13 people and injured dozens, halting traffic along a rail line connecting the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico. “The Mexican Navy has informed me that, tragically, 13 people died in the Interoceanic Train accident,” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum posted on X, adding that 98 people are injured, five of them seriously. In a message on X Sunday, Oaxaca state Gov. Officials said that 241 passengers and nine crew members were on the train when the accident occurred. The Interoceanic Train was inaugurated in 2023 by then President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The rail service is part of a broader push to boost train travel in southern Mexico, and develop infrastructure along the isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The Mexican government plans to turn the isthmus into a strategic corridor for international trade, with ports and rail lines that can connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Interoceanic train currently runs from the port of Salina Cruz on the Pacific Ocean to Coatzacoalcos, covering a distance of approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) .</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When New York-based model and influencer Wisdom Kaye went shopping at the Italian fashion label Miu Miu and returned home with a haul of clothes he says he spent $18,000 on, he didn't expect some of the items would fall apart in front of his eyes. In now-viral videos posted to his TikTok account, where he counts over 13 million followers, Kaye can be seen unveiling his purchases from the brand. In the first clip, posted to the social media platform in early September, he calls himself a “big Miu Miu fan” before launching into a scathing blow-by-blow of how some of his new purchases fell apart as he was unpacking them, saying: “As soon as I get home, everything broke.” Kaye said he had “never gone and gotten multiple pieces from a place and things are just breaking as soon as I get home. Three days later, Kaye popped up on TikTok feeds again. However, as he began to undo the buttons of his vest, a button fell off once again. His mouth was wide in disbelief before exclaiming: “There's no way! Kaye is not the only one taking their concerns to social media. Some onlookers might immediately assume that it was natural wear-and-tear, but Kim said that she had only purchased it a month prior. Elsewhere, on X, a video posted by Elena Qiu in November shows the Seattle-based designer attempting to squeeze various objects into the heel of her leather split-toe tabi boots, to demonstrate its surprisingly hollow interior. “I felt so sad and disappointed when the shoe cap came off,” Qiu later told CNN over email. “As a fashion designer myself, I understand how laborious artisanal craft is, and I don't expect fashion to stay pristine after excessive wear, but these shoes were not worn excessively. I had worn them less than once a month, mostly for special occasions.” Asked what she ended up doing with the shoes, Qiu said she took them to a cobbler to get the heel cap replaced, but has since become more cautious about wearing them regularly and creating further damage — “which defeats the purpose of why I bought them in the first place,” she said. These widely circulated videos have since sparked outrage among social media users, with some questioning the value of high-end goods, especially as prices have been rising exponentially over time. “As fashion consumers we need to put our foot down and stop buying Miu Miu until they learn how to produce clothing that doesn't fall apart,” wrote Odunayo Ojo, the content creator better known as Fashion Roadman, as he reshared Kim's video. Asked whether the Prada Group, which owns Miu Miu, is aware of these videos, and what it is doing to prevent future issues with product quality, the company told CNN that “These were two isolated incidents and they are not indicative of quality issues for the brand. Maison Margiela did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The recent incidents may coincide with a broader issue in luxury fashion, where some experts believe high prices no longer guarantee a certain level of craftsmanship. They have also prompted some comparisons with high street and fast fashion brands, which are often associated with trend-driven pieces that are not always built to last. Speaking on the phone from her Paris apartment, Thomas recalled past trips to Milan that would result in a shopping spree at well-known luxury Italian brands. What used to be a knitted one-piece were now pieces sewn together. As a reporter, I was writing stories about how these companies were booming.” She saw sales growing minimally for brands, yet their profits were significant. “I'm terrible at math but there was an extreme difference between the two. Meanwhile, as a consumer, I could see that the quality was going down,” she said. Her suspicions that some brands were “totally focused on the bottom line” and that “they were switching their focus from beautiful products to beautiful profits” thus became the impetus for her book. Based in Dallas, Texas, Yilmaz has amassed 1.3 million followers on TikTok, over 780,000 on Instagram and another half a million on YouTube for ripping apart and deconstructing bags and other leather goods from luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton and Chanel, with the view to answer a simple question: “Is it worth it?” On a video call, he acknowledged that the rise of social media platforms has made it easier for customers to share their opinions, and therefore, videos expressing disappointment with luxury purchases may seem much more frequent than in years' past, but he believes that there has also genuinely been a shift towards lesser quality products. Yilmaz didn't name specific high-end brands but said that on dissecting bags that had recently been produced, he felt that older styles – and the techniques used to make them – were comparatively “more sophisticated,” the materials “more artisanal.” However, “they are harder to do and are not that quick to make in large quantities,” he said — which may not align with the needs of big companies, several of which have resorted to mass production-like methods to keep up with high consumer demand. While some production still happens in traditional luxury hubs like Italy, the final assembly or component creation of a product often occurs elsewhere, as many high-end brands outsource manufacturing to third-party factories in low-cost regions. These probes revealed that brands frequently outsourced production to a network of subcontractors — many Chinese-owned — who utilized undocumented labor in sweatshop-like conditions to maximize profit margins. Yilmaz added that the luxury sector's exorbitant price hikes — as brands seek to navigate a global market slowdown and rising production costs — has only exacerbated the problem. He caveated: “This is not to say that everything being made is garbage, but unfortunately, increasing prices doesn't mean an increase in quality.” You're taking four or five steps out of the process. So, it wasn't just a style trend, but an economic one.” On writing “Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster,” Thomas recounted visiting a factory “with the same workers, on the same assembly line” making bags for both luxury and mall brands. In the case of Maison Margiela, the brand is not alone in using plastic inside its shoe heels — this has become widespread industry practice, according to Caroline Groves, a UK-based bespoke shoemaker. From the 17th century onwards, people began using wood inside a heel and then fold leather or silk over it,” she said on a call from her workshop in the Cotswolds, England. “Plastic overtook wood at some stage, because people could just churn out hundreds and thousands at a time, very cheaply.” However, she noted that “it is legitimate and gives a strong interior to a heel that is then covered.” Kakkar said that throughout 2025 she has had several conversations with brands about cost-saving, including a reduction in fabric quality. But the cost of 100% silk with beautiful finishing can be quite staggering, because it is almost £50-£60 a meter now, if not more. So, they'll ask if we can do viscose, which is like, maybe, £25. It can be even cheaper, £10, depending on the various qualities. And then, even if those margins are not hitting them, we start looking at viscose polyester blend. “You can see how this slippery slope starts,” she said. For Yilmaz, the cycle of constant, often frantic, creation and consumption across the luxury sector (in the form of new collections, endless content and bigger sales) marks a shift away from historical practices of scarcity and craftmanship. How is that going to happen if everything lasts forever?” When Hermès listed on the stock market in 1993, the founding family maintained a substantial majority ownership, listing only a small proportion of shares. Subsequently, the company was able to emphasize craftsmanship and scarcity, and stick to a highly selective business model that has remained largely unchanged for nearly two centuries. Companies that are 100% publicly traded, for Thomas, “feel like an oxymoron.” She explained: “If your entire raison d'etre is to bring profits to shareholders, you are no longer in the business of making luxury; you're just in the business of making money.” When John Galliano, the former creative director of Maison Margiela, contacted Groves in 2023 to collaborate on footwear that would be shown at the brand's haute couture show in Paris a year later, it ended in “a sad but mutual acknowledgement that we could not reconcile the two worlds of fashion and craft,” Groves recalled. “He would require around 70 pairs made within a very short time frame (6-8 weeks at most). Groves, who has been in business for 40 years, shared that there have been several occasions in which she considered developing footwear for retail. But not all brand founders share this sentiment, and Groves fears that shoppers “who can afford luxury are getting further and further away from the real deal and are therefore losing appreciation of what that really is.” However, increasing scrutiny — and in some cases, distrust — of luxury brands has also created new opportunities. According to McKinsey & Company's 2026 “State of Fashion” report with the Business of Fashion, the mid-market is “the fastest growing segment,” and through attractive price points that correspond with high product quality and elevated store experiences, brands in that range are “replacing luxury as fashion's main value creator.” (Indeed, see the success of contemporary labels like Polene, Toteme or Studio Nicholson.) “You can only say so much to convince people that luxury is high quality. If your products are falling apart in front of them, then it's not believable, no matter how much you spend on marketing,” he said. “So many new brands are entering the space to address this issue, and their products don't cost thousands of dollars. The quality has to start delivering again,” he noted – otherwise, why shop at all?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani has promised to transform New York City government when he becomes mayor. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, already faces intense scrutiny, even before taking office in one of the country's most scrutinized political jobs. Some of his fellow Democrats have deemed him too far left. Progressives are closely watching for any signs of him shifting toward the center. For Mamdani, starting off strong is key, said George Arzt, a veteran Democratic political consultant in New York who worked for former Mayor Ed Koch. “You've got to set a mindset for people that's like, ‘Hey, this guy's serious. That push should begin with Mamdani's first speech as mayor, where Arzt said it will be important for the city's new leader to establish a clear blueprint of his agenda and tell New Yorkers what he plans to do and how he plans to do it. Then in the afternoon, he will be sworn-in a second time on the steps of City Hall, while his supporters are expected to crowd surrounding streets for an accompanying block party. From there, Arzt said Mamdani will have to count on the seasoned hands he's hired to help him handle the concrete responsibilities of the job, while he and his team also pursue his ambitious affordability agenda. Mamdani campaigned on a big idea: shifting the power of government toward helping working class New Yorkers, rather than the wealthy. His platform — which includes free child care, free city bus service and a rent freeze for people living in rent stabilized apartments — excited voters in one of America's most expensive cities and made him a leading face of a Democratic Party searching for bright, new leaders during President Donald Trump's second term. But Mamdani may find himself contending with the relentless responsibilities of running New York City. That includes making sure the trash is getting picked up, potholes are filled and snow plows go out on time. “He had a movement candidacy and that immediately raises expectations locally and nationally,” said Basil Smikle, a Democratic political strategist and Columbia University professor, who added that it might be good for Mamdani to “Just focus on managing expectations and get a couple of good wins under your belt early on.” “There's a lot to keep you busy here,” he said. A large part of Mamdani's job will also be to sell his politics to the New Yorkers who remain skeptical of him, with Smikle saying “the biggest hurdle” is getting people comfortable with his policies and explaining how what he's pushing could help the city. Mamdani's universal free child care proposal — perhaps one of his more expensive plans — is also one that has attracted some of the strongest support from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate from Buffalo who endorsed the mayor-elect. The governor, who is up for reelection next year, has repeatedly said she does not want to raise income taxes — something Mamdani supports for wealthy New Yorkers — however she has appeared open to raising corporate taxes. “I think he has allies and supporters for his agenda, but the question is how far will the governor go,” said state Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, a Mamdani ally. “There's an acknowledgement that the voters have spoken, and there's very clear policies that were associated with his successful campaign,” he said, “so to not make progress on them would be us thumbing our noses at the voters.” But that proposal — perhaps the best known of his campaign — is already facing headwinds, after the city's departing mayor, Eric Adams, made a series of appointments in recent weeks to a local board that determines annual rent increases for the city's rent stabilized units. His relationship with some of the city's Jewish community remains in tatters over his criticisms of Israel's government and support for Palestinian human rights. The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish advocacy organization, plans to track Mamdani's policies and hires as it pledged to “protect Jewish residents across the five boroughs during a period of unprecedented antisemitism in New York City.” Earlier this month, a Mamdani appointee resigned over social media posts she made more than a decade ago that featured antisemitic tropes, after the Anti-Defamation League shared the posts online. The group has since put out additional findings on others who are serving in committees that Mamdani set up as he transitions into his mayoral role. Tensions between Trump and Mamdani have appeared to cool — for now — after months of rancor led into a surprisingly friendly Oval Office meeting. Future clashes may emerge given the sharp political differences between them, particularly on immigration enforcement, along with anything else that could set off the mercurial president.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Director Kash Patel announced that he is surging federal agents and “investigative resources” to Minnesota as a fraud scandal mostly involving Somali immigrants continues to grip the state. In a update on Sunday, Patel said the bureau's investigation will look to “dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs,” some of which have already been uncovered. Patel pointed to numerous indictments and convictions handed down last month against individuals involved with Feeding Our Future, a Minnesota-based organization that stole $250 million worth of federal funds meant for vulnerable children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other alleged fraud schemes have since been uncovered, including by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In a video that has been widely shared, including by lawmakers, Shirley is repeatedly stonewalled by workers at multiple supposed Minnesota daycare centers, which reportedly have no enrolled children. Tim Walz (D-MN) for allegedly turning a blind eye to the fraud. “Tim Walz sat idly by while billions were stolen from hardworking Minnesotans. What Walz refused to address for SEVEN YEARS, Nick Shirley uncovered in ONE DAY. Walz has been pushing back on such accusations, saying he would instead “welcome more” Somali immigrants into Minnesota amid the fraud scandal. None of those officers were charged with fraud, and Omar, who is Somali American, has denied any personal connection to the separate scandal. Most of that valuation is tied up in Rose Lake Capital assets.</p>

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News' CB Cotton and former assistant U.S. attorney for D.C. Cully Stimson join 'Fox News Live' to discuss the arrest of Brian Cole Jr., a ruling allowing the National Guard to remain in D.C. and the probe into the Minnesota fraud scandal. Federal prosecutors said Sunday the man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, told investigators he felt compelled to "speak up" for people who believed the 2020 election was stolen and said he targeted the two major political parties because they were in charge of the political system. Prosecutors detailed the allegations in a memo filed with the Justice Department, arguing that Brian J. Cole Jr., arrested earlier this month, should remain detained as the case moves forward. Cole was arrested in Woodbridge, Virginia, after investigators identified him as the suspect accused of placing pipe bombs near the Capitol complex and outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters, marking the first major break in a case that had gone cold for years. Sunday's memo provides the most detailed government account to date, including statements prosecutors say Cole made to investigators. It also cites evidence such as bomb-making materials recovered from his home after his arrest, which officials say link him to the crime. Brian J. Cole Jr., the D.C. pipe bomb suspect, made his first court appearance on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. Undetonated homemade bombs were discovered Jan. 6, though prosecutors said Cole denied his actions were connected to the events at the Capitol that day. Although he initially denied involvement, prosecutors allege Cole later confessed to placing the devices outside the RNC and DNC. Cole also allegedly said he was disillusioned by the election outcome and sympathetic to claims by President Donald Trump and some allies that it had been stolen. "In the defendant's view, if people ‘feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being – you know, relegated null and void, then, like, someone needs to speak up, right? They added that when agents returned to ask questions about his motive, Cole explained that "something just snapped" after "watching everything, just everything getting worse." The suspect is seen walking outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters moments before placing one of two pipe bombs discovered near party offices in Washington, D.C. (FBI) "The defendant wanted to do something ‘to the parties' because ‘they were in charge,'" prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors said Cole also told investigators the idea to use pipe bombs stemmed from his interest in the historical conflict in Northern Ireland. Cole's attorneys are expected to argue against his detention at a hearing scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The allegations were laid out in a Justice Department memo arguing that Brian J. Cole Jr., who was arrested earlier this month on charges of placing pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees, should remain locked up while the case moves forward. The memo provides the most detailed government account of statements Cole is alleged to have made to investigators and points to evidence, including bomb-making components found at his home after his arrest, that officials say connects him to the act. Cole, 30, denied to investigators that his actions were connected to Congress or the events of January 6, the memo says. But after initially disputing that he had any involvement in the pipe bombs, prosecutors say, he confessed to placing them outside the RNC and DNC. He acknowledged feeling disillusioned by the 2020 election, fed up with both political parties, and sympathetic to claims by Trump and some of his allies that the contest had been stolen. According to the memo, he told agents who interviewed him that if people “feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being — you know, relegated null and void, then, like, someone needs to speak up, right? He said “something just snapped” after “watching everything, just everything getting worse” and that he wanted to do something “to the parties” because “they were in charge,” according to the Justice Department's memo. Prosecutors say when Cole was asked why he had placed the explosives at the RNC and DNC, he responded, “I really don't like either party at this point.” Cole was arrested on the morning of December 4 at his Woodbridge, Virginia, house in what law enforcement officials described as a major breakthrough in their nearly five-year investigation. During a search of Cole's home and car after his arrest, prosecutors say, investigators found shopping bags of bomb-making components. He at first denied having manufactured or placed the pipe bombs, prosecutors say, and when pressed about his whereabouts on the evening of January 5, 2021, initially told investigators he had driven by himself to attend a protest related to the 2020 election. I didn't think that was a good idea, so I went to the protest,” the memo quotes him as saying. But over the course of hours of questioning, prosecutors say, Cole acknowledged he went to Washington not for a protest but rather to place the bombs. Neither device exploded, a fact Cole says he was “pretty relieved” about; he planted them at night because he did not want to kill anyone, the memo says. The fact that the devices did not detonate is due to luck, “not lack of effort,” prosecutors said in arguing that Cole poses a danger to the community and must remain detained pending trial. “The defendant's choice of targets risked the lives not only of innocent pedestrians and office workers but also of law enforcement, first responders, and national political leaders who were inside of the respective party headquarters or drove by them on January 6, 2021, including the Vice President-elect and Speaker of the House,” prosecutors wrote. Cole's lawyers will have an opportunity to state their position on detention ahead of a hearing set for Tuesday in Washington's federal court.</p>

LATAKIA, Syria (AP) — Clashes broke out on Syria's coast between protesters from the Alawite religious minority and counterdemonstrators Sunday, killing at least four people and injuring dozens of others, health officials said. The clashes came two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers. Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven't publicly identified a suspect in Friday's bombing. A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates. Sunday's demonstrations were called for by Ghazal Ghazal, an Alawite sheikh living outside of Syria who heads a group called the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council in Syria and the Diaspora. An Associated Press photographer in Latakia saw pro-government counterprotesters throw rocks at the Alawite demonstrators, while a group of protesters beat a counterdemonstrator who crossed to their side. Security forces tried to break up the two sides and fired into the air in an attempt to disperse them. Syria's state-run television reported that two members of the security forces were wounded in the area of Tartous after someone threw a hand grenade at a police station, and cars belonging to security forces were set on fire in Latakia. Later, state-run news agency SANA reported that a member of the security forces was killed by gunfire. Three of them had head wounds that appeared consistent with being hit by rocks, while one had a bullet wound in the chest. The state-run SANA news agency said 60 people were wounded by “stabbings, blows from stones, and gunfire targeting both security personnel and civilians.” The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December 2024 that brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad, an Alawite, fled the country to Russia. Since then, although the situation has calmed, Alawites have been targeted sporadically in sectarian attacks. They have also complained of discrimination against them in public employment since Assad's fall and of young Alawite men detained without charges. Government officials condemned Friday's attack and promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but haven't yet announced any arrests.</p>

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday insisted Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace deal as he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort, but he acknowledged the negotiations are complex and could still break down, leaving the war dragging on for years. The president's statements came after the leaders met for talks following what Trump said was an “excellent,” two-and-a-half-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine launched the war nearly four years ago. Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations. “Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said during a late afternoon news conference as he stood with Zelenskyy after their meeting. Trump and Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure it's not invaded again in the future. Zelenskyy said Trump had agreed to host European leaders again, possibly at the White House, sometime in January. Trump said the meeting could be in Washington or “someplace.” Trump said he'd follow the meeting with another call to Putin. Earlier Sunday, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side and was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike.” Ushakov said Trump and Putin agreed to speak again “promptly” after Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy. But Ushakov added that a “bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv” on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a “complete cessation” of hostilities. Trump said the parties were inching closer to agreement. That's why President Trump said this is a very tough question and, of course, we have with Russia different positions on it.” Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is “very serious” about ending the war, even as Russia continued striking targets in Ukraine as Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. Trump said, “I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also.” He held out the possibility that negotiations could still fall apart. “In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think,” Trump said. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is “about 90% ready” — echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Trump's chief negotiators met with Zelenskyy in Berlin this month. The proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country's bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks. Zelenskyy also spoke on Christmas Day with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The Ukrainian leader said they discussed “certain substantive details” and cautioned “there is still work to be done on sensitive issues” and “the weeks ahead may also be intensive.” Gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day. After hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and “stop at the battle line,” implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine. Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces. Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. It warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance and would view them as a “legitimate target.” Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk -– one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region — even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.</p>
