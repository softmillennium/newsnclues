December 29, 2025 @ 12:56 pm By Omar Faridi 

BLIFE Protocol, a “decentralized” protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain focused on integrating Web3 applications and cultural experiences, announced it has merged with Portal, an interoperability and liquidity infrastructure for Web3 gaming centered on the utility token PORTAL. The combined business will “operate under the Portal brand.”

Portal will now reportedly maintain its support for cross‑chain gaming and broader interoperability while “integrating BLIFE's Bitcoin‑based projects.”

 Benjamin Charbit, former Ubisoft game director for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, will lead Portal as CEO.

Animoca Brands, a global firm focused on digital assets and Web3 and an early supporter of BLIFE, will support “the relaunch of Portal by providing new capital and relevant gaming portfolio connections to strengthen Portal's business and advance its roadmap.”

G-20 will also support as an “ecosystem and strategic partner.”

BLIFE develops Web3‑native experiences “for the Bitcoin ecosystem, aiming to bridge Bitcoin with broader Web3 activity.”

Over the past two years BLIFE has built and “accelerated key infrastructure and products to expand Web3 adoption on Bitcoin, including BLIFE.ID, the first identity passport inscribed on Bitcoin, and Odin.fun, a fast-growing memecoin trading platform.”

​BLIFE has cultivated one of the largest Bitcoin communities “focused on Web3 and gaming.”

BLIFE's products have brought Bitcoin users into Web3, “creating a highly engaged community that complements Portal's cross chain audience.”

​In mid-2025, BLIFE acquired Beyond, “a tridirectional Bitcoin L1 bridge that connects Bitcoin to other major chains.”

Beyond is preparing for its mainnet launch and “will become part of Portal's interoperability stack.”

This addition will provide Portal with native Bitcoin connectivity and a proprietary cross chain bridge, “positioning Portal as the natural entry point for Bitcoin users who want to access Web3 gaming.”

​The merger of BLIFE and Portal brings BLIFE's ecosystem into Portal's interoperability-focused infrastructure, which “includes Portal Hub, the discovery and interoperability platform of Portal.”

Portal's mission is to connect “every chain, pool, and game into one universal liquidity layer, allowing any on-chain game to tap into deep liquidity across the entire Web3 ecosystem, and establishing a definitive infrastructure layer for cross-chain gaming.”

Portal is an omnichain Web3 gaming platform designed “to unify the fragmented blockchain gaming landscape, establishing a single ecosystem for both game distribution and player engagement.”

Its core mission is to make “discovering and playing Web3 games seamless and frictionless, enabling users to engage with titles across various blockchain networks without the need for complex asset bridging or swapping.”

Portal's flagship discovery and interoperability platform is called Portal Hub.

Portal utilizes an omnichain infrastructure, “including a proprietary cross-chain liquidity layer called Portal Pay.”

Portal Pay allows users to pay with any “supported cryptocurrency while ensuring merchants receive their preferred asset.”

Portal's native utility token, PORTAL, is an Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) with “a total supply of one billion.”

PORTAL token is central to the ecosystem, “serving as the key currency for transactions, governance participation, and staking to drive economic activity within the Portal network.”

BLIFE Protocol is setting a course “at the forefront of Bitcoin‘s core principles and the uncharted territories of the Bitcoin ecosystem.”

Facing a digital ecosystem that is said to be riddled with fragmentation and limited accessibility, BLIFE's stated goal / aim is to effectively “reshape the future of digital currency and virtual interaction.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Agentic commerce company Rezolve Ai has launched a service called “Revenue Pools” for its enterprise customers. The new offering, from the company's SQD Network subsidiary, is designed to bolster rising demand from large enterprise and institutional customers, Rezolve said in a Monday (Dec. 29) news release. “SQD provides high-performance blockchain data services to major global organizations, including Deutsche Telekom and top DeFi protocols such as Morpho and PancakeSwap whose platforms are designed to require continuous, large-scale access to real-time and historical data,” the release said. Resolve said large customers pay to subscribe to data services, and delivering that service at scale requires committed infrastructure capacity by SQD. Tokens are retained by the owner but cannot be moved or sold while locked. When customers pay, a piece of that payment may be shared with the participants, who are compensated in stablecoins. Rezolve says this is important for the SQD ecosystem because as blockchain data “becomes increasingly mission-critical across business operations, payments, analytics and enterprise systems, infrastructure economics matter.” PYMNTS spoke earlier this year with Rezolve Ai CEO Daniel Wagner about the changing face of eCommerce as consumers seek personalization, guidance and immediacy. But Wagner said he believes that a transformation is taking place, one where digital retail, helped by artificial intelligence, must finally provide the intuitive, responsive experience consumers have long taken for granted in brick-and-mortar stores.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) is one of the best beaten-down technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On December 22, analysts at Citi reiterated a Buy rating on Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) but cut the price target to $325 from $485. Likewise, it has echoed legislative reform expected to catalyze the industry's stocks. On December 16, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Strategy Inc. at ‘B-' with a stable outlook, noting the company's new U.S. dollar reserve as a credit positive. The reserve helps cover preferred dividends and coupon payments for 12–24 months, reducing liquidity risk during periods of limited market access and delaying any need to sell bitcoin. On the other hand, between December 8 and December 14, Strategy sold 163,306 shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock. During the week, Strategy also acquired 10,645 Bitcoins at an aggregate price of $980.3 million at an average price of $92,098 per Bitcoin. As of December 14, 2025, the company held 671,268 Bitcoin valued at about $50.33 billion. It also provides AI-powered enterprise analytics software for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence to global customers in sectors like retail, finance, and healthcare, aiming to help businesses make data-driven decisions. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) said its combined crypto, cash and higher-risk “moonshot” investments have reached $13.2 billion, driven by an ether ETH$2,940.97 position that now totals more than 4.1 million tokens. "Year-end tax-loss related selling is pushing down crypto and crypto equity prices and this effect tends to be the greatest from 12/26 to 12/30, so we are navigating markets with this in mind," he added. Bitmine said it has currently staked 408,627 ETH, worth about $1.2 billion, and is working with three staking providers as it prepares to launch its Made in America Validator Network, or MAVAN, in early 2026. The company also released a special chairman's message ahead of its annual shareholder meeting on Jan. 15, 2026, at the Wynn Las Vegas, urging investors to vote in favor of four proposals tied to its long-term strategy. Ether was trading little-changed over the past 24 hours around $2,950 at publication time. L1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins. 2025 was defined by a stark divergence: structural progress collided with stagnant price action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC and ETH ETFs continue to see another week of outflow. At a time when BTC and ETH investment products continue to see outflows, Solana and XRP ETFs have maintained their market-defying momentum, recording their most significant weekly inflows since inception. Crypto investment products saw outflows  of $446 million last week, bringing total outflows since the October 10th shock price decline to $3.2 billion. Despite the recent drawdown, year-to-date inflows remain robust at $46.3 billion, slightly below 2024's $48.7 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) are still up 10% YTD. Bitcoin investment products accounted for the bulk of last week's outflows, shedding $443 million, while Ethereum products followed with $59.5 million in outflows. In contrast, newer products continued to attract capital. Solana and XRP ETFs both posted their strongest weekly inflows since launch, defying the broader trend. The divergence suggests investor confidence is becoming increasingly selective, with capital rotating toward XRP and Solana exposure even as funds continue to exit Bitcoin and Ethereum products. However, like several past instances since October, both tokens failed to sustain the bullish momentum and lost all of their gains within hours of breaking past key resistance. On the other hand, altcoin spot prices remain in the bearish zone; however, due to the recent launch of these products, investors are more open to taking risks with them, as evident from XRP's zero outflow days, while Solana has seen key inflows from time to time.</p>

While many users secured the NFT via the Fortune Draw, Ourbit also opened a public sales channel for those who missed out or wished to accumulate more. Furthermore, Ourbit established an official buyback mechanism at 300 USDT, providing a clear value anchor and downside protection for the asset. “Cosmic Wheel” represents a milestone for Ourbit SuperCEX, successfully blending high-stakes trading, interactive tasks, and long-term equity through its multi-layered design. As 2025 concludes, the campaign provides a reference point for future product development and user-focused initiatives at Ourbit. Ourbit is a new-generation cryptocurrency exchange that merges the best of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) trading into one seamless app. Since its launch, Ourbit has rapidly climbed into the global Top 30 exchanges (CoinGecko & CoinMarketCap), becoming the go-to platform for memecoin lovers and active traders worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 5% tax on billionaires' wealth in California has erupted into sharp warnings this week, with prominent figures from both the tech and crypto sectors, such as Larry Page, Peter Thiel, and David Sacks, threatening to relocate if the proposed tax model is approved. The ballot initiative, California's proposed 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, would impose a one-time 5% tax on net wealth above $1 billion, including unrealized gains on paper assets. A 5% theft of unrealized gains and assets taxes were already paid on is about the most retarded thing I've ever heard. Billionaires will take with them all of their spending, hobbies, philanthropy and jobs. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley posted on X how the application to unrealized gains could force the billionaire residents to sell their stakes or assets to meet tax liabilities, which can, in turn, disrupt the investment and business growth. <2 years ago Ro was pushing against the policy he's advocating for today. While the typical person speaks when they have robust conviction, politicians of this… https://t.co/h4HAHCvZyq Palmer Luckey, cofounder of Anduril, a defense technology firm, publicly denounced the proposal, stating it could compel founders to sell large shares of their companies to pay the bill, while other prominent billionaires warned that the tax might be an “organized government seizure of private property.” Billionaire Bill Ackman said California is on a path to “self-destruction” if the tax act moves forward. He posted on X (formerly Twitter) that “Hollywood is already toast, and now the most productive entrepreneurs will leave, taking their tax revenues and job creation elsewhere. US Representative Ro Khanna defended the bill, saying that this act could help in the betterment of California's economy, including sectors such as childcare, housing, and education. My district is $18 trillion, nearly 1/3 of US stock market in a 50 mile radius. He mocked Peter Thiel and Larry Page as they consider leaving California if the tax bill is implemented, saying that he will miss them very much. As Ro Khanna received tremendous criticism and was accused of “scaring away billionaires”, he counter-argued that “We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places, but where 70% of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, and education are unaffordable. What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.” “Those saying that we wouldn't have a future NVIDIA in the Bay if this tax goes into effect are glossing over Silicon Valley history. He started NVIDIA in my district because of the semiconductor talent, Stanford, innovation networks, and venture funding.” Chamath Palihapitiya warned the tax would “kill entrepreneurship in California,” arguing that “founders whose wealth is tied up in illiquid equity could be forced into untenable cash demands just to cover the levy.” Even *David Sacks, a prominent tech executive and White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, shared on social media that  “5 % across-the-board confiscation of net worth,” hinting that he may reconsider his own California residency in response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MUSE ENT NFT USD (MSCTUSD) is currently priced at $0.00015000663, with a change percentage of 0.0%. Though it seems to be at a standstill, it's crucial to examine why the price is stable and what future forecasts predict for this cryptocurrency. Currently, MSCTUSD is holding steady at $0.00015000663, unchanged in its percentage move for today. The RSI, MACD, and ADX are all at 0.00, showing neither oversold nor overbought conditions, which predicts continued stability in the absence of new market catalysts. This neutrality is reinforced by the absence of significant trends as observed in envelopes and oscillators. However, forecasts can change due to macroeconomic shifts, regulations, or unexpected events affecting the crypto market. The significant drop from previous highs indicates past bearish pressures, but the potential for recovery suggests latent investor interest that may resurface with broader industry developments. While MSCTUSD remains stable today, the data indicates potential long-term growth. Investors should watch for any developments in the NFT space that could drive future price changes, keeping in mind the volatile nature of crypto markets. As of now, MSCTUSD is priced at $0.00015000663 with no percentage change for the day. Technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and ADX are at 0.00, suggesting no current trend direction. This neutrality means the price is likely to stay stable unless influenced by new market factors. Yes, macroeconomic shifts, regulatory changes, or unexpected market events can influence MSCTUSD prices, as with any cryptocurrency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has been having a hard time over the last few months after hitting a brand new all-time high back in August 2025. As crypto analyst Alpha Trade Scope points out in a TradingView post, the Ethereum price chart is still showing major signs of weakness. For example, the digital asset saw its price crash below a descending trendline, and this has marked the continuation of the downtrend that began three months ago. There has also been a major shift in the market structure of the Ethereum price. For one, there was a Change of Character (CHoCH), which shows that the Ethereum price is no longer bullish, but is rather more bearish at this point. Resistance has also mounted at the $3,000 level over time, and the price has been trading well below this resistance for a while now. Also, the Ethereum price is caught in a tight range, trading within the Fair Value Gap (FVG) mapped out between $2,930 and $2,960. This shows the rising resistance at this level, that could serve as a rejection in the case of a recovery attempt. How Low Can The ETH Price Go? However, it is not the final target. In the case of a further break, then $2,800 is expected to give way, leading to the second major target at $2,748. This target is more of a major demand zone and is more likely to trigger a bounce due to the mounting buying pressure at this point. “The chart presents a classic bearish continuation setup, favoring downside expansion if support breaks with confirmation,” the analyst said.

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act proposes a 5% levy on wealth over $1B, including unrealized gains, raising concerns for startup founders and crypto investors. Crypto and tech leaders warn California's wealth tax could drive founders, capital, and innovation out of the state amid fears of illiquid asset taxation. California's proposed billionaire wealth tax is quickly becoming a major flashpoint for the cryptocurrency and technology sectors. While state leaders say the policy will help fund public services, critics argue it could weaken the startup and innovation economy that helped make California a global powerhouse. The core issue, according to industry leaders, is that the tax misunderstands how modern wealth is created, particularly in crypto companies, startups, and venture-backed businesses, where most wealth exists on paper rather than in cash. The revenue would be directed toward healthcare and social programs. What sets this plan apart is its inclusion of unrealized gains, meaning individuals could be taxed on assets they have not sold. This includes private company equity, startup shares, and long-term crypto holdings, assets that are often illiquid and difficult to convert into cash. Critics say it creates financial pressure for founders whose wealth is tied to business ownership rather than income. Many startup founders take modest salaries and rely on equity for long-term value. This situation, critics argue, forces founders to make difficult choices, including selling equity early or taking on personal debt just to meet tax obligations. Several industry leaders, including Hunter Horsley, Nic Carter, and Jesse Powell, have warned that the tax could accelerate capital flight from California. They argue that startups, venture capital firms, skilled workers, and philanthropic investment could gradually shift to regions with more predictable tax environments. In a digital-first economy, capital and talent are highly mobile, and policy signals play a major role in where innovation settles. He argues that the tax is not gradual but an immediate 5% charge on total wealth, which can create serious cash-flow problems for founders. In some cases, founders could owe tens of millions of dollars based on short-term valuations, even though their assets remain illiquid. If those valuations later fall, the tax liability may still stand, leaving founders financially exposed. It reflects a growing gap between policymakers and innovation-driven industries. Crypto leaders worry that policies targeting paper wealth could discourage builders at a time when global competition for talent and capital is intensifying. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. Founders with wealth tied to equity may owe large taxes without cash, forcing early share sales or debt and increasing financial risk. Industry leaders warn unpredictable taxes may drive founders, investors, and companies to states with more stable, innovation-friendly policies.
