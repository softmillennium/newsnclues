                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The administration's deep cuts to humanitarian assistance come at a time when aid is needed more than ever. Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. The Trump administration on Monday announced a commitment of $2 billion to United Nations humanitarian assistance efforts, a fraction of what the US has previously provided as President Donald Trump's foreign aid cuts continue to wreak deadly havoc worldwide. “Afghanistan is not included on the list, nor is Palestine, which officials say will be covered by money included in Trump's yet-to-be-completed Gaza plan.” The Associated Press observed that “even as the US pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought, and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.” A conservative tracker maintained by Boston University epidemiologist Brooke Nichols estimates that the Trump administration's assault on foreign aid programs has killed more than 700,000 people — a majority of them children. In a blog post for the Center for Global Development earlier this month, Charles Kenny and Justin Sandefur wrote that “while quantification is difficult, there is little doubt many people have died as a result, and without action many more will die in the future.” Thanks to a generous supporter, your one-time gift today will be matched immediately.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It seemed, at least superficially, to have been one of the better face-to-face meetings between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, their sixth in a year that has seen this relationship fray to breaking point and require regular and painstaking repairs. Trump called the meeting “terrific” and asked if Zelensky and his general who “looks like central casting” had enjoyed the food. And yet, beneath the veil of politeness, there was rhetoric from the US president that suggests his default position in negotiations is still to pressure Kyiv, while appeasing Moscow. On the toughest question of all – territory – Trump at one point suggested it might anyway be “taken” in the coming months,  asking, “are you better off making a deal now?” It was a line eerily similar to that of Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, summarizing a call between President Vladimir Putin and Trump earlier on Sunday: “Given the situation on the front lines, it would make sense for the Ukrainian regime to adopt this decision regarding Donbas without delay.” Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted on a call with journalists that Trump “apparently reminded them (the Ukrainian side) that Ukraine is losing land and will continue to lose it.” While Russian forces continue to inch forward in the eastern Donbas region, Putin has demanded that Ukraine cede land that Russia has yet to seize. In the lead-up to the Alaska summit between Trump and Putin in August, European leaders worked hard to bring Trump round to the idea that a ceasefire was needed before peace negotiations, something Moscow has always dismissed. In the end, it was Putin who won that argument, and, more than four months later, Trump still appears to support his view. “He (Putin) feels that, look, you know, they're fighting to stop and then if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn't want to be in that position. While Ukraine is sounding increasingly open to discussion of territorial concessions, Zelensky has made it clear that giving up, or changing the status of, Ukrainian land would likely require a referendum, something he says cannot happen without a ceasefire lasting at least 60 days. War, missiles, artillery,” Zelensky said in comments to journalists Monday morning. As he spoke, most Ukrainian regions started a new week with regular blackouts, and more than 9,000 households in the Kyiv region woke up with no power at all. Hardly surprising then, that the Ukrainian president shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other as he listened to Trump describe Putin as “very good” on the issue of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia seized by force in March 2022 and has occupied ever since. “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open. The facility has been cut off from its external power supply 12 times since Russia's occupation, and earlier this month the UN's nuclear watchdog warned that Moscow's constant attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure are also a threat to its security. “Persistent instability in Ukraine's electrical grid continues to undermine nuclear safety,” said Director General Rafael Grossi. On one critical issue for Ukraine there has been a small step forward: security guarantees. Up until now, Kyiv only had verbal assurances the US would participate in post-war security guarantees, after Trump shifted his position in August. Now these assurances are in writing, albeit with a 15-year expiry date – which Zelensky wants extended – and still in need of congressional approval. The guarantees would not mean US troops on the ground, but at least there would be support for Europe if they decided to send theirs. And yet until Russia and Ukraine can come together for direct talks, which Zelensky hopes could happen in January after another circuit of discussions with allies, all of this is hypothetical. That prospect seemed even more remote Monday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Kyiv of attacking one of Putin's residences, promising Moscow would “review” its negotiating position as a result. Zelensky rejected the claim as “another lie” from Russia. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, reiterated Monday that Russia wants “the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from Donbas beyond its administrative borders.”  That, of course, includes territory Russia hasn't been able to occupy in nearly four years of war. Takeaways from Trump's meeting with Zelensky in Florida The diplomatic merry-go-round revs up again now going into 2026, with adviser-level meetings followed by a gathering of the “Coalition of the Willing” in Paris in early January, and then a potential Washington summit with Trump, Zelensky said Monday. Meanwhile the Trump administration has proposed that discussions continue in several working groups, an idea endorsed by Moscow. And yet in this now largely predictable cycle, you can't rule out a sudden shift. In October, a frustrated Trump slapped sanctions on Russia's oil giants, a move that has caused Russian oil prices to plummet to their lowest level since the February 2022 invasion. The leaders are meeting, conversations ongoing,” wrote Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at London-based think tank Chatham House in a post on X. Former Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev struck a less optimistic tone. “If you want to delay anything for (an) indefinitely long time – create a few working groups,” he wrote.

Faster, stealthier missiles, accelerated weapons development, and the threat of an unrestrained nuclear arms race, set against the backdrop of a withering arms control regime, point to a worsening global nuclear threat as 2025 comes to a close. On top of that, just before meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping in October, President Donald Trump abruptly, and very imprecisely announced in a social media post, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” The suggestion that the United States might break with a more than three decade-long moratorium on explosive tests sparked a global wave of uncertainty, anxiety, and speculation about the impacts of a potential return to explosive nuclear testing. This comes in the final months of a year when five of the world's nine nuclear armed countries have been engaged in active warfare. That two-page document, the Nobel Laureate Declaration, calls for a recommitment to a moratorium on nuclear explosive testing, enhancement and expansion of nuclear diplomacy, and for scientists, academics, communities of faith, and civil society to create pressure on global leaders to take nuclear risk reduction measures. Everyone interviewed for this story agreed that nuclear threats have increased in recent months, underscoring the urgent need to reduce risks and begin new conversations. “That conversation has been picked up by a lot of people around the world but it has not yet, in my opinion, changed the dial, but it is the beginning,” said Brian Schmidt, a professor of astrophysics at Australian National University and a Nobel laureate (2011 physics). “I see it as that first step, and we are now looking at how we do the next steps and keep bringing it up in conversations.” The deteriorating nuclear threat landscape is reflected in the symbolic Doomsday Clock, now set at 89 seconds to midnight, its closest-ever setting to global catastrophe. As nuclear nations increase spending and reliance on their arsenals with some people even calling for more countries to acquire nuclear weapons, Laura Grego, senior research director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, was under no illusion that a two-page document alone would change the world, but calls it a necessary step. “I didn't expect that everybody would put their pens down and say, ‘the laureates have spoken. '” Rather, she compared the declaration to a protest or demonstration which, by itself, does not bring immediate change, but must be part of a longer, sustained effort. Even as Trump has made ambiguous and alarming statements about testing nuclear weapons, he has called for a comprehensive missile defense system called “Golden Dome” intended to “defend against all types of missiles from any adversary,” something Grego describes as “fantastical.” Others find the idea ill-defined and flawed. “This massive investment in strategic missile defense is really unhelpful,” Grego told Truthout. Breaking through to policy decision-making circles, Grego said, can be difficult as they are often sequestered in the Pentagon and may not be elected officials responsive to voters. Grego says members of Congress are rarely questioned by their own constituents on nuclear issues and that lack of public input is just fine with the powerful, highly organized corporate interests who stand to make a lot of money building expensive weapon systems. In particular, on rarely challenged issues like nuclear weapons, small, incremental steps can have a positive impact. They were the result of sustained movements and public pressure. She recognized that people today have a long list of concerns — the economy, health care, crime, the precarious state of democracy — but she said, “[We]'ve got to make room for the nuclear threat as well because it's here whether or not you want to focus on it…and lack of attention is not going to make the problem better. She urged people to start talking about nuclear issues and ask their elected leaders how they are addressing the threat. He said the nuclear threat seems distant and gigantic, but, he added, “We know eventually our luck will run out.” He said, “We need to be gripped by some sense of urgency that we have made this deal with nuclear weapons to base our security on them and we know that deal is not going to work forever.” Given the enormity of a global nuclear catastrophe, Lewis said, “The fate of the world is everybody's problem, and everybody has a role to play.” “It's a shame because [Trump] has real political power,” said Lewis. Those recommended steps could begin, he said, if there was a single leader among the nine nuclear weapons states who had the courage and moral conviction to prioritize nuclear risk reduction. “I am somewhat encouraged that President Trump has said more than once that he is fearful of the effects of nuclear war. I think he appreciates how dangerous nuclear weapons are on a strong personal level,” Countryman said. “The problem is that neither he nor any of his counterparts in other nuclear weapon states have yet taken a meaningful step forward.” Although he has little confidence that Washington or Moscow will make significant progress on nuclear arms control in the next few years, Countryman says he has hope — “not confidence, but hope”— that China is in a unique position to do so. Countryman will be watching the anticipated Trump-Xi summit in China next April closely. While he expects the meeting will focus on economic issues, it may be possible to address some nuclear matters too. “That may be too ambitious for both bureaucracies, but if both presidents have a little bit of courage and imagination, it could be done.” And while it could be possible, he fears there are “too many political and bureaucratic obstacles from any of the other nuclear armed states from moving forward on something dramatic.” He conceded that conveying practical nuclear risk steps like those in the Nobel declaration is an uphill battle because, as he put it, in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing, “those who favor more nuclear weapons are in the ascendancy… all of them are feeling more confident and have the ear of their respective leaders much more frequently than those who are advocating for reduction of nuclear risk.” That UN study, like the Nobel declaration and depictions of nuclear weapons in books, music, movies, and popular media, as well as concerns about nuclear testing, nuclear proliferation, and the collapse of arms control, underscores the urgent need for more public engagement. “Once the public is aware and engaged, as it should be, because they will be impacted if this goes wrong … then policy makers start to pay attention.” Thanks to a generous supporter, your one-time gift today will be matched immediately.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of Detroit home demolition sites were potentially backfilled with toxic construction debris from a demolished shopping mall and other sources, creating an unfolding public health threat in the city's neighborhoods. It was left with tens of thousands of empty structures as industrial plants closed and people left the city in past decades – Detroit's population dropped from nearly 2 million people around 1950 to fewer than 700,000 today. Despite repeated requests from the Guardian, Mayor Mike Duggan's administration and state regulators have so far not disclosed which toxins have been detected. Independent environmental health experts and a former regulator say lead, mercury, cadmium, PAHs, and asbestos – chemicals that are toxic at very low exposure levels – are likely in the type of slag used to backfill the neighborhood sites. The problem could have been avoided, some demolition experts say. Contaminated sites were found three times previously, and in 2018 drew federal scrutiny. The latest round of contaminated sites – potentially 424 so far – is on pace to be the widest scale, and comes as Duggan leaves office this week to campaign full-time for governor as a pro-business independent. He has touted his blight elimination program as a top achievement. Steve Hoin, a former state regulator who worked on previous Detroit demolition site remediations, questioned whether the administration followed advisory protocols developed in 2018 with state and federal regulators. The 2018 protocols also may not have been rigorous enough because they did not require the city or contractors to test all dirt. “Regardless, it's mismanagement because clearly they had knowledge in 2017, and before that, that contaminated fill was coming in, and they haven't fixed the problem,” said Hoin, a former geologist with the Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE). “I'm not sure if it was competence, or ‘we don't care about the protocol because we want to get the demos done in time. Duggan's replacement, Detroit city council mayor pro tem Mary Sheffield, will inherit the problem, which Duggan estimated could cost about $18,000 per property to remedy, though some experts said it could be higher. “It's not possible to prevent all unscrupulous contractors from using bad soil, but no one has been more effective than the City of Detroit at holding them accountable when they do.” Roach said the test results will be publicly released. A spokesperson for EGLE said the agency “will continue working with the City to determine appropriate actions, including possible remediation or enforcement if contamination is confirmed”. At a 22 December press conference, Duggan announced that 424 sites had been identified as potentially contaminated, but did not name the contaminants. Duggan said 32% of 50 sites tested so far were “above regional background levels”. The regional background levels are important because an exceedance triggers a mandatory environmental cleanup and indicates a risk to the public. In effect, the city may now have small toxic waste dumps scattered throughout its neighborhoods, which is a “gargantuan problem”, said Allen Burton, an ecosystems management researcher with the University of Michigan. However, it opened an opportunity for contractors to lie and claim their dirt came from residential areas to avoid testing, said RJ Koscielniak, an Eastern Michigan University geology professor and urban decline scholar. The contaminants likely in the shopping mall debris are linked to health issues like cancer and reduced cognitive ability in children. Hoin and Burton added that chemicals like lead are so toxic that even those below background levels can still be a danger. During his 22 December press conference, Duggan downplayed the health threat, stating that there would only be a risk “if you were to dig through the foot of topsoil and spend a lot of time digging in the dirt.” Burton said hazardous waste sites are capped with specialized liners or several feet of clay, which Detroit has not put in place. Burton added: “I don't buy what the mayor said. “I think the mayor is just trying to get people off his back.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for UN humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump's administration continues to slash US foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to “adapt, shrink or die” in a time of new financial realities. The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of US demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services. The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional US humanitarian funding for UN-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to UN data. US officials say only $8 to $10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its UN membership. Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease and harmed US soft power around the world. The move caps a crisis year for many UN organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in US foreign aid, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Even as the US pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes. They have already received billions less from the US this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration — or even during Trump's first term. Now, the idea is that Fletcher's office — which last year set in motion a “humanitarian reset” to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent — will become a funnel for US and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered US contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid. The United States wants to see “more consolidated leadership authority” in UN aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the US diplomatic mission in Geneva. “This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars — providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,” said US Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz. US officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA's annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. “Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.” “Today's agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump's commitment to remaining the world's most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.” At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine. One of the world's most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Trump's as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan. The project, months in the making, stems from Trump's longtime view that the world body has great promise, but has failed to live up to it, and has — in his eyes — drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Greene gives lengthy interview with New York Times days before stepping down as congresswoman for Georgia Marjorie Taylor Greene, now just days away from stepping down as a congresswoman for Georgia, has said in her latest mea culpa interview that she “was just so naive” for believing that Donald Trump was a man of the people. In a lengthy interview with the New York Times that examines her break with the president after years of devotion, Greene explained that a series of minor ruptures with the president culminated in a total breach after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was killed in September. The third-term Georgia congresswoman said she was watching Kirk's memorial service on TV when his widow Erika said she forgave her husband's killer. But then Trump took the stage to say that unlike Kirk – “a missionary with a noble spirit” who did not “hate” his opponents, Trump said he disagreed. And that's the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.” Green said that her turn away from unrepentant Maga acolyte came in that moment and she abandoned her training “to never apologize and to never admit when you're wrong”. “As a Christian, I don't believe in doing that,” she said. “I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.” Greene said she later told a friend that after Kirk died, “I realized that I'm part of this toxic culture. The Maga landscape post-Kirk has been showing signs of fracture, and Greene has found herself at odds with administration and Republican positions, declaring the war in Gaza a “genocide” as well as casting doubt on economic, healthcare and foreign policy positions that she says do not prioritize working-class Americans. “I was just so naive and outside of politics,” Greene said, adding: “It was easy for me to naively believe.” Greene said the Epstein files represented “everything wrong with Washington” and said it was a story of “rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. After meeting with victims, she claimed, Trump called her and yelled “my friends will get hurt” if the files were released. In the interview, Greene said that she had been wrong to accuse Democrats of treason.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIRE is a personal finance movement which stands for 'financial independence, retire early. Kristy Shen retired in her 30s and is an author of the bestselling book Quit Like a Millionaire. She wants IVF fertility treatments to have children, and would like to spend some money on coaching as an endurance athlete. Would it be a good idea to forgo those things to achieve her early retirement FIRE (financial independence, retire early) goal at age 45? As someone who retired in their 30s after working a stressful job and investing for nine years, I understand the allure of having infinite time to pursue your passions, travel the world and spend time doing whatever you want, whenever you want. It might seem quite logical to pursue this dream by accumulating money as quickly as possible, even at the detriment of everything else. After all, I'd been taught by my mom that “money is the most important thing in the world.” When you grow up living on 44 cents a day, you focus constantly on making more money. A summer camp for grown-ups trying to escape the work force forever with FIRE Money is a tool to help you buy back your time. But what good is free time if you spend it sad, sick or alone? Even Warren Buffett, one the world's most celebrated investors said in his biography, that the highest measure of success in life comes by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. “Some people die filthy rich and get buildings named after them, but the truth is that nobody in the world loves them.” I feel it whenever my husband laces his fingers through mine as we walk down the street. You can “draw” on it for financial security when you need to step back from work to spend time with family. Or for when work gets overwhelming, and you need to downshift or pivot to another career for your health. Since water is fluid and adaptable, so are your FIRE plans. You can continue your dreams of building a family, supporting loved ones, or occasionally go back to participating in the working world to earn money rather than closing off the well once you've hit a specific financial target. Don't draw from it mindlessly to pay for status symbols that only feed your ego. I would rather you retire later with the family you want, and in amazing physical shape, rather than retiring at 45 with no family and in worse health.” Measure your life by love instead of money, and you'll be truly wealthy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Ukraine's cemeteries, some graves are more than symbols of memory. Through a guided tour of Lukianivske Cemetery in Kyiv, visitors can discover how these artists contributed to art amid empire collapse, war, and repression. "Russia's long-standing colonial policy toward Ukraine has historically led many Ukrainian artists to be mistakenly associated with Russian culture, or for their legacy to have been suppressed in the USSR," said journalist Darka Hirna, who conceived the project. "The ongoing full-scale war has intensified discussions in Ukrainian society about these artists and how they often had no choice but to study and work in Russia, yet still identified themselves with Ukrainian culture." An interactive website allows people to explore their legacies in greater depth. There are around 40 artists buried at the cemetery in total. However, "The Invisible Gallery" focuses specifically on artists Oleksandr Bohomazov, Mykola Murashko, Viktor Palmov, Fedir Krychevskyi, Oleksandr Murashko, Volodymyr Orlovskyi, Serhii Sviatoslavskyi, and Mykola Pymonenko. Mykola Murashko (1844–1909) was a founder of the Kyiv Drawing School and authored some of the earliest manuals for art students in Ukraine. Volodymyr Orlovskyi (1842–1914) is considered one of the founders of Ukrainian Realist landscape painting, while Serhii Sviatoslavskyi (1857–1931) specifically excelled in plein air landscape painting, capturing Ukrainian outdoor life with atmospheric sensitivity. Realist painter Mykola Pymonenko (1862–1912) documented urban and rural Ukrainian life with ethnographic precision, and among his students was a young Kazimir Malevich. Oleksandr Murashko (1875–1919), nephew of Mykola Murashko, studied under Ilya Repin at the Imperial Academy of Arts before evolving from realism into a vivid, colorful Impressionism influenced by his time in Munich and Paris. His psychologically penetrating portraits, including the iconic "Girl in a Red Hat", established him as one of Ukraine's most famous artists. Oleksandr Bohomazov (1880–1930) emerged as a leading figure in Ukraine's avant-garde scene, developing a distinctive Cubo-Futurist style that fragmented form and color into dynamic, energetic compositions. Viktor Palmov (1888–1929) pushed avant-garde experimentation even further through bold color contrasts and expressive techniques that challenged conventional artistic approaches. "Ms. Oksana revealed to attendees (of the tour) details about the artists' burials, how they lived, what they did for their country beyond creating incredible paintings, as well as information about their families, estates, and the sculptures on their graves," Samboryk said. By drawing visitors' attention to these artists' through visits to their graves, Hirna hopes the project will do more than revive interest in their work. In France, the Pantheon serves as a secular mausoleum, a place where the country's most celebrated writers, scientists, and political figures are laid to rest, their collective achievements enshrined as a testament to their impact on French society. Embracing this European tradition of cultural memory, "in which a historical cemetery is not only a place of mourning but also a cultural space," would help strengthen Ukrainian society during one of its most difficult periods, according to Hirna. I always love a good cemetery story, not to mention one that's mixed in with decolonizing historical memory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump is correct to say that Ukraine peace talks are in their final phase, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Trump hosted Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky in Miami on Sunday for the latest round of discussions on a possible peace proposal for Russia. Asked whether Trump was right to assert that the world is now much closer to peace, Peskov said that “certainly” was the case. During his joint press conference with Zelensky, Trump said the deal was 95% ready, even though he personally didn't like to measure progress in percentages. Peskov said Trump is yet to brief Putin on the details of his latest talks with Zelensky, which the two leaders agreed would happen in a phone call soon. He also reiterated Moscow's reluctance to make public comments about the specifics of American mediation. Earlier, Zelensky revealed a 20-point plan that he claimed was under consideration, but Trump did not express support for the draft during the joint press conference. When asked later whether the US had a ‘Plan B' should its mediation fail, Zelensky said that Russia should be the party thinking about a backup, because allegedly “Russia's ‘Plan A' is war.” Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly stated that Moscow has always preferred to seek diplomatic solutions to all differences and considers military action only as a last resort, which was the case with Ukraine. Russia sees NATO's increasing involvement in Ukraine and Kiev's discriminatory policies targeting ethnic Russians as the key causes of the crisis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts say taxes, lifestyle factors and immigration rules are just some of the reasons Canadians with dreams of moving abroad end up staying put.Illustration by Photo illustration by The Globe and Mail/Getty Images/iStockphoto But while interest in emigrating appears to be rising, many of those inquiries never turn into an actual move. Rahul Sharma, a partner at law firm Fasken, describes many would-be emigrants as “tire kickers.” They're typically wealthy Canadians over the age of 50 who explore their options, imagine a different lifestyle and shop around for a new country, only to stay put in Canada once they confront the true costs and legal complexity of leaving. “I think we should be alarmed about these individuals and their desire to leave,” Mr. Sharma said. He has seen many young people want to go because they “simply do not see Canada as providing them with an environment in which to succeed at the entrepreneurial level.” That concern comes as Canada appears to be losing some of its appeal among high-net-worth individuals more broadly, according to a 2025 report from advisory firm Henley & Partners. Using data from research firm New World Wealth, the report estimates Canada will see a net inflow of about 1,000 wealthy migrants in 2025, the lowest figure on record. Many Canadians feel 'disadvantaged' by the country's tax system, experts say.GEOFF ROBINS/AFP/Getty Images Still, the most persistent driver among middle-aged wealthy Canadians is taxes, said Brandon Davies, founder of Clarity Cross Border, a financial planning firm, and a financial planner certified in both Canada and the United States. He said that many wealthy Canadians feel “disadvantaged” by the high tax rates they are subject to. In Ontario, for example, the surtax on personal income can reach 56 per cent. For some, the idea of relocating to a lower-tax jurisdiction is tempting, especially when they compare potential savings abroad to the heavy tax burden at home. “They want to be the people on a yacht while others are shovelling snow,” he said. From Portugal to Mexico, snowbirds are scouting beyond the U.S. for vacation homes For young entrepreneurs, Greg Moore, a partner at Richter Family Office, which manages many high-net-worth clients, said many want to be surrounded by people similar to them. There's a culture of risk-taking that is more evident within the United States.” A recent study from Toronto venture-capital firm Leaders Fund found that just 32.4 per cent of Canadian-led “high-potential” startups launched in 2024 were headquartered in this country. The survey defined these startups as having raised US$1-million, with most of their senior leaders educated in Canada, and tracked 2,932 such companies over a decade. But the reality of emigrating is often far more complicated than clients expect. While the tax can be deferred, Ms. Schwartz said doing so requires months, and sometimes years, of planning. “They take a sober second look and say, ‘Okay, is this really something that I want to do?' Young entrepreneurs tend to face fewer obstacles, and that's why they are the ones who typically end up leaving Canada, experts say. With smaller portfolios and fewer family obligations, they often incur less departure tax and may not need to move an established business, Ms. Schwartz said. While Canada's system covers most medical costs, emigrants often face steep private insurance premiums abroad. For clients moving to the U.S., annual coverage can easily exceed $20,000. The holders of TN visas, which permit qualified Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the U.S., for example, must leave if they lose their job, and spouses may not be permitted to work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky took place at the US leader's Mar-a-Lago estate near West Palm Beach, Florida. On December 28, Trump received Zelensky at his Mar-a-Lago estate near West Palm Beach, Florida. Following more than two hours of bilateral talks, Trump and Zelensky participated in a video conference with European leaders. The hour-long video conference focused on security guarantees. After the talks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X that good progress had been made. At a joint press conference, Trump acknowledged that the territorial issue remains unresolved in the Ukrainian settlement process. He opined that Russia, the US, and Ukraine are now "much closer" to a deal than ever before. According to the US president, an agreement could be reached in "a few weeks." However, Trump admitted that it may not be possible to reach a deal at all. In turn, Zelensky stated that Ukraine's position on territorial concessions still differs from Russia's. He also said that 90% of the peace plan has been agreed upon and that security guarantees for Kiev have been agreed upon entirely. The US working group on Ukraine will include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, businessman Jared Kushner, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Kane.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Undersecretary of State Sarah Rogers has defended Washington's decision to sanction several Europeans, saying that “extraterritorial censorship of Americans” undermines free speech and innovation. Last week, the US State Department imposed sanctions on five individuals, including British nationals Imran Ahmed and Clare Melford, German citizens Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, and former EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said those targeted had “led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Rogers said the measures were aimed at protecting free expression and the competitiveness of the US technology sector. “These are people who, in many cases, took government money to destroy American businesses for the purpose of suppressing American speech,” she said. “These are, ultimately, serious decisions that rest with the Secretary of State and take into account all of our foreign policy priorities. But free speech is one of those priorities, and so is the continued ability of the American tech sector to lead and innovate,” she added. Elon Musk, whose platform X was fined about €120 million ($140 million) by EU regulators for what they described as violations of transparency rules set out in the bloc's Digital Services Act, welcomed the move, calling it “so great.” Earlier, Musk blasted the penalty, calling the EU a “bureaucratic monster” that should be abolished, while accusing Brussels of trying to pressure X into censoring speech. French President Emmanuel Macron, who appointed Breton himself, accused Washington of “coercion and intimidation.” UK Labour MP Chi Onwurah said banning individuals over speech disputes undermines the free speech the US administration claims to defend. The rift was reflected in Washington's latest National Security Strategy, which warned that the EU faces potential “civilizational erasure” due to curbs on free speech, suppression of political opposition, and regulatory pressure on innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump said he agreed with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that a ceasefire amid arrangements for holding a referendum in Ukraine would not work. Reporters asked the US leader to share the details of his phone call with Putin regarding whether Russia had agreed to a ceasefire for the period of holding a referendum in Ukraine. "Not a ceasefire, and that's one of the points that we're working on right now. Look, you know, they're fighting, and to stop, and then if they have to start again, which is a possibility. He doesn't want to be in that position. I understand that position," Trump said at a joint press conference with Vladimir Zelensky at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on December 28. "The [Russian] president feels strongly about that or something, but I think we're finding ways that we can get around that. But I understand President Putin from that standpoint. And you know, I'm on the side of peace. Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov revealed that in the phone call on December 28 the two presidents "generally shared the view that a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and Europeans — whether to prepare for a referendum or for other reasons — would only prolong the conflict and could lead to a resumption of hostilities."</p>
