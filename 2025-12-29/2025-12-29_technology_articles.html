TSMC has quietly revealed that it had commenced volume production of chips using its N2 (2nm-class) fabrication process. From an improvement standpoint, N2 is designed to deliver a 10%–15% performance gain at the same power, a 25%–30% reduction in power at the same performance, and a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E for mixed designs that include logic, analog, and SRAM. For logic-only designs, transistor density is up to 20% higher than N3E. This geometry improves electrostatic control, reduces leakage, and enables smaller transistors without sacrificing performance or power efficiency, ultimately increasing transistor density. In addition, N2 also adds super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal (SHPMIM) capacitors to the power delivery network. These offer more than twice the capacitance density of the prior SHDMIM design and cut both sheet resistance (Rs) and via resistance (Rc) by 50%, which improves power stability, performance, and overall energy efficiency. "N2 is well on track for volume production later this quarter, with good yield," said C.C. Wei, chief executive of TSMC, during the company's earnings call in October. "We expect a faster ramp in 2026, fueled by both smartphone and HPC AI applications." Previously it was expected that TSMC would begin ramping up N2 production at Fab 20 (near Hsinchu, Taiwan), which is adjacent to its new global R&D center, where N2-series fabrication technologies were developed. Fab 20 will likely commence mass production a bit later. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. TSMC will be ramping up mass production of N2-based chips at brand-new fabs, which is always a bit tricky. What is noteworthy is that the company will ramp production of both smartphone and larger 'AI' and 'HPC' designs at new fabs (note that HPC is a vague term that describes everything from game console SoCs all the way to heavy-duty server CPUs), which will add some additional complexities. Normally, TSMC ramps new nodes with mobile and small consumer designs. Ramping up two N2-capable fabs at once is a result of strong interest for the new process technology by a variety of TSMC partners, so it needs to offer decent capacity for all of them. Furthermore, starting late 2026, both fabs will be used to build chips on N2P, a performance-enhanced version of N2, and A16, a version of N2P with the Super Power Rail backside power delivery that is aimed at complex AI and HPC processors. We also introduced A16 featuring our best-in-class Super Power Rail, or SPR. A16 is best suited for specific HPC products with complex signal routes and dense power delivery networks. Volume production is on track for second half 2026." Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Founders in the Seattle area are busy building software for health insurance, AI model tuning, construction processes, and hospital operations. Our latest Startup Radar spotlights four early stage tech startups in the region: Amera, Clara, Oiyko, and Specbook. Read on for brief descriptions of each company — along with pitch assessments from “Mean VC,” a GPT-powered critic offering a mix of encouragement and constructive criticism. Its product converts medical claim documents into structured data, replacing manual entry and supporting newer payment models. Amera is generating revenue, working with multiple plan administrators, and participating in the Fall 2025 cohort at Y Combinator. Leadership: CEO Deep Kapur previously worked at Microsoft, Protocol Labs, and most recently Rupa Health. Co-founder Louise Tanski was also at Rupa Health and co-founded Moonshot Brands (acquired by Infinite Commerce). The key will be proving your structured data actually drives measurable cost or accuracy improvements — not just faster paperwork.” The business: A self-described “AI-powered operating room orchestration” platform for hospitals. Clara aims to be like Apple's “Find My” app, but for patient care, helping hospital staff quickly locate equipment and people. She was named a 2025 “Up and Comer” at the PSBJ Healthcare Leadership Awards. Co-founder Aaron Cooke was previously a senior software engineer at Viome and Julep. Mean VC: “The problem is clear to anyone who's worked in a hospital, and your background gives you credibility where it counts. But unless you can tie this to patient outcomes or hard ROI, hospital budgets may treat it as a luxury.” The business: Helps companies fine-tune AI models using their own data, enabling employees to add business-specific context. Mohan was a senior technical program manager at Microsoft for more than four years. Mean VC: “Fine-tuning with business context is a sharp idea, especially as enterprises grow wary of generic AI outputs. Leadership: Co-founders Gordon Hempton and Wes Hather co-founded Outreach, the Seattle-based sales software company. More recently they launched two startups: B2B sales software company FullContext and virtual work platform Spot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Holiday cheers turned to jeers directed at Amazon last week as some film fans were surprised by a gutted version of the Christmas classic “It's a Wonderful Life” on Prime Video. It's unclear if Amazon recently added the “abridged” labeling on that version. The Post story, and an accompanying video (below), detailed how the missing sequence factors into the film as a distraught George Bailey — who wishes he'd never been born — sees how his hometown of Bedford Falls devolves into a corrupt, neon-lit “Pottersville” without his existence. The sequence helps Bailey realize how important his simple life is in shaping the fate of many, and his despair turns to joy. A 2022 University of Connecticut law school blog post explains how the film fell into the public domain when its distributor failed to renew its copyright in 1974. This lapse helped turn “It's a Wonderful Life” into a holiday classic because TV stations freely aired the movie for decades around Christmas without paying royalties. Television networks were directed to stop playing “It's a Wonderful Life” without permission or the payment of royalties. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Kirkland, Wash.-based tech company is suing its New York-based acquisition advisor, alleging it was pushed into a $5.2 million acquisition that was supposed to generate $1 million annually but has instead required ongoing cash infusions just to stay afloat. Its affiliate, TGP GP Management, a management and acquisition advisory firm, entered into an agreement to advise SmarTek21 on acquisitions and related matters. According to the complaint, TGP almost immediately began pressuring SmarTek21 to acquire IT Avalon, as a complementary business that would augment SmarTek21's existing model and diversify its customer base. The suit says TGP represented that IT Avalon would generate at least $1 million annually in free cash flow, before other benefits from the combination. The complaint alleges that TGP's principal Ashray Prasad dismissed concerns raised by SmarTek21 executives about IT Avalon's deteriorating finances in the days before closing. According to the suit, Prasad repeatedly called Lalji urging him to close the deal — placing many of these calls while Lalji was undergoing treatment for a serious medical condition. According to the suit, IT Avalon's revenue had been declining since 2022, and its operating income had dropped significantly, while its vendor relationships deteriorated. TGP structured the deal so that any working capital shortfall would be offset against future earnout payments to IT Avalon's sellers. But that proved worthless, the suit alleges, because IT Avalon had almost no chance of hitting the revenue targets that would trigger those payments. “The combined entity now benefits from an expanded client base, talented personnel, and a robust pipeline of opportunities. We intend to vigorously defend against these baseless claims.” “We are building a category-defining platform,” said TGP's Prasad, who is also a member of SmarTek21's board of managers, in the press release. According to the company's public materials, SmarTek21 provides product engineering and enterprise software services to Fortune 250 clients in industries including financial services, healthcare, and telecom. Lalji and SmarTek21 did not respond to requests for comment.

That said, it helps that it's someone returning to their roots rather than a private equity firm looking to strip-mine the assets. You cannot sell Steam keys without being Steam or the developer itself, and not be called a "reseller". Or what sites are you referring to here, stuff like Humble Bundle where you get Steam keys with the bundles? Real stores sell steam keys because they are selling directly from the developers. Steam is actually nice (or preempting monopoly talk, depending on your view) in that it allows that (I think there are limits, but IIRC rather generous) You can sync up your Steam wishlist (it's a little weird to setup but once you figured it out it works).I almost never buy games directly from steam anymore, there's almost always someone else with a discount on steam keys.And sometimes GOG has the best deal!

GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year. In fact, we've seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.I'm really happy to hear this, as I always feared their hard stance on no-DRM would scare off publishers and developers, but seems that fear might have been overstated. This year I personally also started buying more games on GOG than Steam, even when they were available on Stream. Prior to 2025 I almost exclusively used Steam unless it wasn't available there, but now GOG is #1 :)Glad it's moving in even better directions, thank you Team GOG!

It's kinda a idealist vs realist stance for me. I picked up a bargain bin CD ROM of this game in 1996 and it works under dosbox as well as it ever did. Which is to say mostly ok but sometimes hilariously crashy. CD Project makes great games, but gaming industry is all-or-nothing. They already had colossal flop at their previous release. You have to give kudos to CD PROJEKT for not just abandoning the game after a bad launch (which is what every other major studio would have done in its place) but patiently fixing problems and constantly adding content over 5 years to get to the state it is in today. Just one paid expansion which added a ton of new content. Rare to see this behavior in the industry today. If one flops, that might be the end of them. CD PROJEKT wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stranger Things has just one more episode left in the tank, which means, for the particularly fearful fans among us, one more chance for the show to make some big sacrifices in its final season to stop Vecna once and for all. The show has definitely been teasing the potential for some big tragedies to occur, but fear not, aforementioned fearful fans: you won't necessarily spend your New Year's Eve in horror as Hawkins' finest get wiped out. “There's not going to be a Red Wedding situation.” Instead, the showrunners want the show's end to focus on a feeling of satisfaction, rather than necessarily shock value. “I think some things happen in the finale that are very surprising, but we're not trying to shock or upset anyone,” Duffer continued. “I hope by the time people get to the end of the finale that it just feels like there's something inevitable about what happens, and that it doesn't feel painful but feels satisfying. But for all that talk of less pain and more resolution, that doesn't necessarily mean there won't be a final sacrifice by anyone on the show… and that it still won't be a prominent character. The Duffer brothers are painfully aware that poor Steve Harrington has been getting death flag after death flag spotted by fans as the show's progressed, making him an oft-dreaded candidate for most likely to die in the series finale—but naturally they're still staying mum until the credits roll on if he'll make it out of the show in one piece. “The only way we could take it further is death.” The final episode of Stranger Things hits both Netflix and theaters in a limited capacity this Wednesday, December 31.

The final battle begins December 31—but first, we have praise and a few nitpicks to pass along to Netflix and the Duffer Brothers. The actor behind Vecna, Henry, and Mr. Whatsit breaks down his complex role in season five. However, viewers were kept in the dark until season five's second batch of episodes, now streaming on Netflix. Season five's second volume has some familiar padding, but it mostly satisfies as the Netflix show races toward its end.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're not ending 2025 without a last bit of awful news: Wildlife officials are sounding the alarm about a dangerous brain illness spreading among deer in North America. Over the last several weeks, officials in Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Manitoba, Canada, have reported cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in new areas. The mad cow-like illness can spread easily between deer and has a 100% fatality rate. When a rogue prion encounters its regular counterpart, it somehow forces the latter to misfold as well, almost like a zombie infection. Over time, this amassing army of bad prions will destroy the animal's brain, leading to death. Prion diseases have been found in many animals, humans included. The most infamous one might be bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow disease. Much like mad cow, deer and related cervids afflicted with CWD will experience neurological symptoms like confusion, trouble walking, and rapid weight loss (the titular wasting). CWD was first discovered in the U.S. over 50 years ago, though it took longer for scientists to determine that prions are behind it. And it's been spreading further across North America ever since. Cases have now been documented in at least 36 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces. Last week, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources confirmed its first positive CWD test result of a deer in La Crosse County. The increasing presence of CWD in North America is concerning for several reasons. CWD can be transmitted relatively easily, compared to other prion diseases like mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common, but still rare, prion disease that affects humans. CWD can spread directly through contact with infected animals and bodily fluids like saliva, and might also spread through prions left behind in the environment by urine or feces. That means CWD has the potential to cause sustained outbreaks of illness in both free-ranging and captive deer populations. There's also the scary, if still only theoretical, danger of transmission to humans. Mad cow has sparked outbreaks of CJD in humans, caused by people eating contaminated beef. The possibility exists that a similar event could happen with hunters who eat CWD-tainted meat. Last year, for instance, a team of researchers argued in a case report that two hunters who died from CJD may have been infected after consuming CWD-infected deer. Here's What We Know About the Risk to Humans So even if CWD never directly harms us, it could cause a serious ecological disaster—large outbreaks could devastate local deer populations, which in turn would affect other species in the area, or cause the closure of deer farms, a $7.9 billion industry. To that end, Wisconsin officials have extended an existing baiting and feeding ban in La Crosse County (baits can attract large populations of deer to an area). Three people in Hood River County have contacted Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease over the span of eight months, an unusual pattern for an incredibly rare disease. A recent case report has stoked fears that deer can transmit universally fatal prions to humans. Two recent cases of prion disease in the U.S. may have been caused by contaminated deer meat, though the connection is still unproven.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosecutors allege handwritten notebooks detailed hundreds of optimized manufacturing steps developed over five years. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Last week, South Korean prosecutors indicted multiple individuals in a case alleging that a former Samsung engineer leaked advanced DRAM manufacturing process data to China's ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), shedding light on how leaked trade secrets may have accelerated China's push into 10nm-class memory. This may have caused trillions of losses in Korean Won for both Samsung and South Korea. The formerly employed Samsung Electronics engineer is accused of bypassing internal digital security systems by manually recording sensitive process data in handwritten notes. These notes are believed to have covered more than 600 individual manufacturing steps, including detailed parameters such as gas flow ratios, reactor pressures, and photoresist settings used during critical lithography and deposition stages. It's estimated that Samsung invested roughly 1.6 trillion KRW over five years to develop its 10nm DRAM technology. The core allegation is that CXMT was able to bypass much of that learning curve and, by extension, cost by calibrating its own production equipment using the stolen process “recipes,” adjusting them as needed to account for differences in toolsets and materials. This would not have eliminated the need for validation work, but it could have dramatically reduced the time and cost required to reach acceptable yields at advanced nodes. As a result of this, CXMT has emerged as China's most advanced DRAM producer over the past several years, beginning volume shipments of 17nm DRAM in 2022 and moving into 10nm-class production in 2023, a transition that surprised many, given the technical difficulty of scaling DRAM without access to leading-edge lithography tools. While companies have invested heavily in digital access controls, monitoring, and data loss prevention systems, handwritten notes remain difficult to track or audit. Investigators say the accused engineer exploited this gap by memorizing and transcribing process flows, which is virtually impossible to police effectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nintendo Switch family of consoles is great at a lot of things, but you know what they're not any good at? OK, it's probably a highly specific market lamenting that one oversight, but if you find yourself in that niche, then UK-based peripheral maker iMP Tech might have just the thing for you. It's built around an eight-button base unit with a retro-style eight-way joystick, emulating the look and feel of classic rigs, with your console slotting in to serve as the screen. It also packs in a few touches you wouldn't find in the arcade, like a mappable Turbo feature. Given the Switch is home to a host of classic arcade-style games—thanks to titles included in the Nintendo Switch Online libraries for NES, SNES, and Genesis/Mega Drive, and through various retro releases such as Namco Museum over the years—this should make for a gadget perfect for delivering some (slightly gimmicky) throwback fun. Each of those is hinged, allowing you to insert the core tablet of either console, and then seals magnetically to hold it safely in place. A rear panel adds stability and 12 storage slots for Switch game cards, and then the console tray slides into place, docking onto a male USB connector. A marquee strip then snaps onto the top, holding everything together. The arcade base draws power from the console, but a through-port underneath allows you to plug a USB-C charger. The unit pairs with the console as a controller, which involves a little bit of menu diving and telling your Switch to regard it as a Pro Controller in wired communication mode. With four large, rubber feet, it feels nice and stable on most surfaces—you'd have to be engaging in some vigorous joystick wiggling to send it flying. There is a hitch using this cabinet with the Switch 2, specifically—the recent 21.0.0 system update means that Mini Arcade Pro units with batch number 0925 need a firmware update to work properly. It's not only iMP Tech caught out by this—many third-party peripherals seem to be having issues as a result—but the fix requires a cable with a female USB-C port to apply the update. iMP says it will provide an appropriate cable to customers who need one, on proof of purchase. You'll also need a Windows PC environment to run the updater, as it's an .exe file. Unfortunately, after you've done all that construction and updating, the Mini Arcade Pro presents one major problem: You have to look at it. Sure, building it around the Switch's widescreen display means digressing from the boxy 4:3 displays that many originals had, and the shrunken-down structure is a wholesale departure, but it still sits on your desk like a sense memory given form. This is, bluntly, absolutely atrocious on multiple levels. The headline marquee juxtaposes two terrible fonts—a sort of jaunty Comic Sans-on-acid for “MINI ARCADE” and a blocky, italicized, faux-pixelated “PRO”—into an overly colorful mess that feels juvenile and childish, rather than retro. The side panels feature a quartet of layered arrows extending along the height and depth of the unit, an idea that could have a bit of simplistic ‘80s charm to it, but applied in slapdash fashion, with different widths to each arrow that make it look like badly pasted clip art. While the arrow's color order is consistent with the cabinet's face buttons—red, yellow, green, blue—that feels more like a happy accident than a deliberate choice. Each side panel has a hallucination of nightmarish faces—I think they're faces—and distended hands; jagged teeth and what looks like bunched-up intestines, all grasping at impossibly-shaped gaming controllers and exploding out of some sort of apocalyptic meat grinder. Elsewhere, the main control panel and that already-blighted marquee have more malformed controllers, flying out of yet more explosions. Even if these elements had been applied with intent and drawn by an actual human—one who knew what a controller looks like or realized that internal organs don't typically leave the body for a gaming session—the aesthetic is far too busy, leaving this looking like a complete mess. I reached back out to iMP to ask about its clear use of AI imagery for the Mini Arcade Pro. In response, a representative said: “Due to time constraints, the production team in China relied on various imagery for use on the outer marquee to hit production timelines; however, that is now under consultation and is due to be revised as part of a running change.” A potential sliver of good news for future buyers, then. However, there's no word yet on when a revised design may enter production, what that design may be, or if it would be more AI slop. If you can look past the dreadful aesthetics, or fancy redecorating it yourself (hey, it's an art project, too! ), then the Mini Arcade Pro is at least decent fun to use. The joystick feels especially delightful—nicely responsive and satisfyingly “clicky” as it moves around. However, this is actually a trick borrowed from other console arcade sticks, and it works surprisingly well for 2D fighters such as Ultra Street Fighter II. Capcom's classic series builds combos from light, medium, and heavy punches and kicks, which is best suited to a six-button layout. Played on a ‘regular' controller, those inputs usually extend from the four face buttons to the right-hand shoulder buttons. Here, the B, A, and ZR buttons, and the Y, X, and R buttons line up in rows, so the game plays just like it would on an actual cabinet. As the Mini Arcade Pro is only designed for one player, it feels better suited to arcade puzzlers, shooters, and side-scrolling beat-'em-ups anyway. The Golden Axe games in Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Collection, the entire roster of Capcom Beat-'Em-Up Bundle, and Namco Museum's Splatterhouse all fared well, as did classics Pac-Man and Galaga. Shooters in particular are where that Turbo feature does come in handy—hold down the Turbo button, then the input you want to apply the feature to, and blast away to your heart's content. That's probably not enough to salvage this for most players, though. Unless you're using your Switch or Switch 2 to near-exclusively play old-school games—or at least old-school style games, like Streets of Rage 4 or Terminator 2D: No Fate—then this has limited appeal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal warrants name four suspects who posed as U.S.-based developers using company hardware. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The FBI has published a public wanted notice naming four individuals accused of operating as fraudulent remote IT workers on behalf of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), tying the group to identity theft, wire fraud, and the alleged theft of more than $900,000 in virtual currency from U.S. companies. The FBI has issued a $5 million reward for information "that leads to the disruption of financial mechanisms of persons engaged in certain activities that support North Korea." Prosecutors allege the defendants used stolen or falsified identities to obtain remote software engineering and IT roles, then abused their access to company systems and digital wallets during 2022. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice, in a related operation, said that they searched 29 suspected “laptop farm” locations across 16 states, seizing dozens of financial accounts and websites used to support the scheme. In 2022, the FBI said that North Korea "has dispatched thousands of highly skilled IT workers around the world" who "in many cases misrepresent themselves as foreign (non-North Korean) or U.S.-based teleworkers, including by using virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private servers (VPSs), purchased third-country IP addresses, proxy accounts, and falsified or stolen identification documents" in a bid to evade detection for as long as possible. It's not difficult to see why crypto-linked companies are frequent targets. Access to internal repositories, signing keys, and wallets can be far more valuable than traditional payroll fraud, particularly when attackers maintain long-term access under the guise of legitimate employment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea is you chat with it like you would chat with a friend, interruptions and all, even if the actual answers are the same as you'd get from typing your queries into Gemini as normal. Now, about a year and a half after its debut, Gemini Live has been given what Google is describing as its “biggest update ever.” The update makes the Gemini Live mode even more natural and even more conversational than before, with a better understanding of tone, nuance, pronunciation, and rhythm. There's no real visible indication that anything has changed, and often a lot of the responses will seem the same as before too. The update is rolling out now for Gemini on Android and iOS. Gemini Live can now add more feeling and variation to its storytelling capabilities—which can be useful for history lessons, bedtimes for the children, and creative brainstorming. The AI will even add in different accents and tones where appropriate, to help you distinguish between the characters and scenes. You could get Gemini Live to give you a retelling of Pride and Prejudice from the perspective of each different Bennett sister, for example, or have the AI spin up a tale of what life would have been like in your part of the world 100, 200, or 300 years ago. Another area where Gemini Live's new capabilities make a noticeable difference is in educating and explaining: You can get it to give you a crash course (or a longer tutorial) on any topic of your choosing, anything from the intricacies of human genetics to the best ways to clean a carpet. The AI can now go at a pace to suit you, which is particularly useful when you're trying to learn something new. If you need Gemini Live to slow down, speed up, or repeat something, then just say so. As usual, be wary of AI hallucinations, and maybe don't trust that everything you hear is fully accurate or verified. If you're wanting to learn something like how to rewire the lighting in your home or fix a problematic car engine, double-check the guidance you're getting with other sources, but Gemini Live is at least a useful starting point. This extends to the language learning mentioned above, because you can hear words and phrases spoken as they would be by native speakers—and then try to copy the pronunciation and phrasing. While Gemini Live doesn't cover every language and accent across the globe, it can access plenty of them. There are certain safeguards built into Gemini Live here, and your requests might get refused if you veer too close to derogatory uses of accents and speech, or if you're trying to impersonate real people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Kevin Hartz's security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren't good enough. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year. The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham's startup lab Atomic, and Hartz's investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel. After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said. “Securing people's homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people's minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don't respond because they assume it's a false alarm.” The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.” The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage. As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. I don't want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we're such a small company,” he said. “Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it's because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron's three founders, which include roboticist and engineer Vasumathi Raman. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.” The surveillance state questionFacial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said. Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron's approach. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco's Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats. “We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We've seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron's path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.) It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality. The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.
