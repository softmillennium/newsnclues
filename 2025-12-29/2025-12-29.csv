            President Donald Trump said the United States had taken out a “big facility” last week as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela but did not provide further details on the reported US action.
    


            “We just knocked out — I don't know if you read or you saw — they have a big plant, or a big facility, where the ships come from. Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard,” Trump told John Catsimatidis, the major Republican donor whose radio show airs on WABC. The interview occurred on Friday.
    


            The stray comment came amid a discussion of the president's ongoing campaign against Venezuela and its leader Nicolas Maduro, including strikes on alleged drug boats and a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers.
    


            Trump did not expand on the action that he claimed took out a plant or facility, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment. It is also unclear to what facility the president was referring or where it was located.
    


            One US official said the president was describing a drug facility, but declined to provide further detail about the action. There have been no reports from Venezuela of a major facility being destroyed.
    


            Trump has been threatening strikes on land in Venezuela for weeks as the US has launched strikes destroying 30 boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. American officials have said previously that targets could include drug production facilities or known trafficking routes.
    


            The president has also authorized covert CIA action inside Venezuela as part of the campaign to increase pressure on Maduro.
    


            During a Christmas Eve phone call to troops aboard the USS Gerald Ford, which Trump recently ordered deployed to the Caribbean Sea, Trump called the region an “interesting place” to be, and said the US would be “going after the land.”
    


            If the timing the president referred to during his interview is correct, the strike on the facility would have occurred around the same time.

            Former world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua suffered bruises in a car crash that resulted in the deaths of two individuals on Monday, according to local police in Ogun State, Nigeria.
    


            The incident occurred around 11 a.m. (5 a.m ET) on a busy stretch of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, which connects Ogun to the commercial center of Lagos, police reported.
    


            “Anthony Joshua is well and responding to treatment,” Babaseyi Boluwatife, a spokesperson for the Ogun State Police Command, told CNN.
    


            Joshua, who has family ties in Ogun, sustained only “minor bruises,” but Boluwatife said two other occupants in the vehicle with him, including the driver, were killed. Those who died were foreign nationals, Ogun officials said.
    


            According to a statement from Nigeria's Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Joshua was traveling in a Lexus SUV that collided with a parked truck while attempting to overtake.
    


            It said preliminary findings indicated that the Lexus Jeep, “which was suspected to be traveling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit on the corridor,” lost control while overtaking and crashed into the stationary truck at the side of the road.
    


            The agency added, “The primary causes of the crash being excessive speed and wrongful overtaking constitute serious traffic violations and remain among the leading causes of fatal road crashes on Nigerian highways.”
    


            A video showing Joshua being rescued from the wreckage has been circulating on social media. The boxer, born to Nigerian parents in Watford, near London, has stayed connected to his roots.
    


            Joshua could not immediately be reached for comment.

Houthi rebels in Yemen have declared any Israeli presence in the breakaway region of Somaliland a legitimate military target. The warning comes days after Israel became the first country to recognize the independence of the Somalian territory. 

In a statement on Sunday, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi stated that Israel's move constitutes “aggression against Somalia and Yemen, and a threat to the security of the region,” stressing that the militant group will “consider any Israeli presence in Somaliland a military target for our armed forces.”

The group, which has halted attacks on Israel since a Gaza truce in October, framed the threat as an act of solidarity, while accusing Israel of seeking to conduct “hostile activities.”

The warning follows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's signing of a declaration on Friday recognizing Somaliland as a sovereign state, making West Jerusalem the first government to officially do so.

Located on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden in East Africa, Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 but has remained internationally isolated. Netanyahu stated that the move was made “in the spirit” of the Abraham Accords and invited Somaliland's president for an official visit.

Somalia's government denounced the move as a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty. Israel's actions have also triggered a wave of international condemnation as a broad coalition of nations and organizations have rejected the move. 

Critics include Egypt, Türkiye, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League, and the European Union, all of which have reaffirmed support for Somalia's territorial integrity. US President Donald Trump has also indicated that he does not currently intend to follow Israel's lead.

The African Union warned it “risks setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent,” affirming that Somaliland remains part of Somalia. 

Experts note the strategic motive behind Israel's recognition could be to gain access to Somaliland's port of Berbera, which could provide Israel with better access to the Red Sea, enhancing its ability to monitor or strike Houthi positions in Yemen.

Poland must remain “ready to defend the western border” with Germany, President Karol Nawrocki has declared. The remarks drew pushback from Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who insisted that as long as Germany is an EU and NATO member, it poses no threat.

Nawrocki delivered his warning on Saturday at an event marking the anniversary of a 1918 uprising against German rule, recalling that Poles had lived under “severe German imperialism” during historical partitions, when “aggressive” efforts were made to “take away our culture and national heritage.”

Poland, he said, is a “national community open to the west, but also a national community ready to defend the western border of the republic.” Nawrocki, who was elected this year with the support of the right-wing opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, stressed that “we must do everything we can to ensure that Poland remains Poland.”

The remarks drew an immediate response from Foreign Minister Sikorski. “As long as Germany is in NATO and the EU, and is governed by Christian or social democrats, there is no threat to our western border,” Sikorski said.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed the criticism, saying that the remarks reflected “the essence of the dispute between the anti-European bloc… and our coalition. A deadly serious dispute… over our values, security, sovereignty. East or West.” Nawrocki fired back by noting that “it's hard to believe that we graduated from the same department – history.”

PiS, with which Nawrocki is aligned, has long presented Germany as a threat to Polish sovereignty. In 2023, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski warned that the EU is seeking to introduce a “German plan” that would result in the “annihilation of the Polish state.” He has accused Tusk – whom he compared to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler – of leading a “pacification operation” to destroy Poland's independence and “turn us into farmhands for people from Western Europe, especially Germany.”

The distrust harks back to the brutal Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II, for which Warsaw has recently demanded up to $1.3 trillion in reparations. Berlin has rejected the claim, saying the legal matter has long been put to rest.

US President Donald Trump is correct to say that Ukraine peace talks are in their final phase, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

Trump hosted Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky in Miami on Sunday for the latest round of discussions on a possible peace proposal for Russia. Asked whether Trump was right to assert that the world is now much closer to peace, Peskov said that “certainly” was the case.

During his joint press conference with Zelensky, Trump said the deal was 95% ready, even though he personally didn't like to measure progress in percentages. “We're doing very well,” he added. “We could be very close.”

Peskov said Trump is yet to brief Putin on the details of his latest talks with Zelensky, which the two leaders agreed would happen in a phone call soon. He also reiterated Moscow's reluctance to make public comments about the specifics of American mediation.

Earlier, Zelensky revealed a 20-point plan that he claimed was under consideration, but Trump did not express support for the draft during the joint press conference. When asked later whether the US had a ‘Plan B' should its mediation fail, Zelensky said that Russia should be the party thinking about a backup, because allegedly “Russia's ‘Plan A' is war.”

When asked about the remarks, Peskov said Kiev should heed Trump's warnings that the situation on the front was getting worse for Ukrainian troops every day. He stressed that “Russia is seeking the suspension of the military conflict in the context of achieving its objectives.”

Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly stated that Moscow has always preferred to seek diplomatic solutions to all differences and considers military action only as a last resort, which was the case with Ukraine. Russia sees NATO's increasing involvement in Ukraine and Kiev's discriminatory policies targeting ethnic Russians as the key causes of the crisis.

WASHINGTON, December 29. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said he agreed with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that a ceasefire amid arrangements for holding a referendum in Ukraine would not work.

Reporters asked the US leader to share the details of his phone call with Putin regarding whether Russia had agreed to a ceasefire for the period of holding a referendum in Ukraine. ""Not a ceasefire, and that's one of the points that we're working on right now. No, not a ceasefire. He (Putin - TASS) feels that. Look, you know, they're fighting, and to stop, and then if they have to start again, which is a possibility. He doesn't want to be in that position. I understand that position,"" Trump said at a joint press conference with Vladimir Zelensky at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on December 28.

""The [Russian] president feels strongly about that or something, but I think we're finding ways that we can get around that. But I understand President Putin from that standpoint. You know, you have to understand the other side. And you know, I'm on the side of peace. I'm on the side of stopping the war,"" the US leader added. ""I think that's a problem that's going to get solved,"" he concluded.

Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov revealed that in the phone call on December 28 the two presidents ""generally shared the view that a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and Europeans — whether to prepare for a referendum or for other reasons — would only prolong the conflict and could lead to a resumption of hostilities.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON, December 29. /TASS/. The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky took place at the US leader's Mar-a-Lago estate near West Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump said that the territorial issue is one of the remaining unresolved issues in the negotiations to settle the conflict in Ukraine. Trump and Zelensky also announced the formation of working groups to address the issue.

TASS has compiled the main information on the meeting results.

On December 28, Trump received Zelensky at his Mar-a-Lago estate near West Palm Beach, Florida.

Following more than two hours of bilateral talks, Trump and Zelensky participated in a video conference with European leaders.

The hour-long video conference focused on security guarantees. After the talks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X that good progress had been made.

At a joint press conference, Trump acknowledged that the territorial issue remains unresolved in the Ukrainian settlement process.

He opined that Russia, the US, and Ukraine are now ""much closer"" to a deal than ever before.

According to the US president, an agreement could be reached in ""a few weeks."" However, Trump admitted that it may not be possible to reach a deal at all.

In turn, Zelensky stated that Ukraine's position on territorial concessions still differs from Russia's.

He also said that 90% of the peace plan has been agreed upon and that security guarantees for Kiev have been agreed upon entirely.

In addition, Zelensky changed his position, admitting that the peace deal could be approved by a vote in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) instead of a referendum.

At a joint press conference, Trump and Zelensky announced the composition of the working groups on the settlement.

The US working group on Ukraine will include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, businessman Jared Kushner, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Kane.

The Ukrainian working group on the settlement will include Security Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, Chief of the General Staff Andrey Gnatov, and First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Kislitsa.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Toxic chemicals like lead and asbestos are likely in dirt used to backfill demolished structures in city, experts say

Hundreds of Detroit home demolition sites were potentially backfilled with toxic construction debris from a demolished shopping mall and other sources, creating an unfolding public health threat in the city's neighborhoods.

Detroit, the nation's lowest income big city, is in the US industrial heartland. It was left with tens of thousands of empty structures as industrial plants closed and people left the city in past decades – Detroit's population dropped from nearly 2 million people around 1950 to fewer than 700,000 today. The city's demolition program is widely considered the largest ever in the US.

Despite repeated requests from the Guardian, Mayor Mike Duggan's administration and state regulators have so far not disclosed which toxins have been detected. Independent environmental health experts and a former regulator say lead, mercury, cadmium, PAHs, and asbestos – chemicals that are toxic at very low exposure levels – are likely in the type of slag used to backfill the neighborhood sites.

The problem could have been avoided, some demolition experts say. Duggan's demolition program brought down tens of thousands of homes at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars over his 12 years in office. Contaminated sites were found three times previously, and in 2018 drew federal scrutiny.

The latest round of contaminated sites – potentially 424 so far – is on pace to be the widest scale, and comes as Duggan leaves office this week to campaign full-time for governor as a pro-business independent. He has touted his blight elimination program as a top achievement.

Steve Hoin, a former state regulator who worked on previous Detroit demolition site remediations, questioned whether the administration followed advisory protocols developed in 2018 with state and federal regulators. The protocols were designed to avoid a repeat of the same problems.

The 2018 protocols also may not have been rigorous enough because they did not require the city or contractors to test all dirt. Testing is the best way to ensure dirt is safe, but it would have slowed the demolitions.

“Regardless, it's mismanagement because clearly they had knowledge in 2017, and before that, that contaminated fill was coming in, and they haven't fixed the problem,” said Hoin, a former geologist with the Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE). “I'm not sure if it was competence, or ‘we don't care about the protocol because we want to get the demos done in time.'”

Duggan's replacement, Detroit city council mayor pro tem Mary Sheffield, will inherit the problem, which Duggan estimated could cost about $18,000 per property to remedy, though some experts said it could be higher.

In a statement, Duggan administration spokesperson John Roach said contaminated backfill dirt is a problem around the country, and the suggestion that the issues in Detroit reflect bad city management “is false”.

“The only reason this has come to light is because of the City of Detroit's investigation and testing,” Roach said. “It's not possible to prevent all unscrupulous contractors from using bad soil, but no one has been more effective than the City of Detroit at holding them accountable when they do.” Roach said the test results will be publicly released.

A spokesperson for EGLE said the agency “will continue working with the City to determine appropriate actions, including possible remediation or enforcement if contamination is confirmed”.

The current problems came to light earlier this year when a Detroit office of inspector general investigation found a contractor hired by the city had used dirt contaminated with construction debris from the demolition of the Northland Shopping Mall. Testing reported in early November found 42 of 47 sites exceeded pollution thresholds, and much of that was “unsafe for direct human contact”.

At a 22 December press conference, Duggan announced that 424 sites had been identified as potentially contaminated, but did not name the contaminants.

Duggan said 32% of 50 sites tested so far were “above regional background levels”. The regional background levels are important because an exceedance triggers a mandatory environmental cleanup and indicates a risk to the public.

In effect, the city may now have small toxic waste dumps scattered throughout its neighborhoods, which is a “gargantuan problem”, said Allen Burton, an ecosystems management researcher with the University of Michigan.

“There might be a bag of really toxic stuff there,” Burton said.

The 2018 protocols were developed after debris from a freeway demolition was used to fill neighborhood demolition sites. The protocols increased scrutiny of dirt sources and required testing of dirt sourced from commercial land.

However, it opened an opportunity for contractors to lie and claim their dirt came from residential areas to avoid testing, said RJ Koscielniak, an Eastern Michigan University geology professor and urban decline scholar. He did his doctoral dissertation on Detroit demolitions and has reviewed hundreds of thousands of program documents.

Koscielniak said the city never “put in place legitimate controls” in part because regulations were opposed by contractors, and because the administration did not want to slow the demolition program.

“There's an insistence that [the demolitions] get done with a velocity that compromises any regulations,” he said.

The contaminants likely in the shopping mall debris are linked to health issues like cancer and reduced cognitive ability in children. Those living around the sites face a health risk from dust that blows off the property, Hoin said. Children playing on the sites, or others who come into contact with the dirt, may face more immediate health impacts.

Hoin and Burton added that chemicals like lead are so toxic that even those below background levels can still be a danger. The background threshold for lead in Detroit is higher than in other cities, and does not necessarily convey safety, Burton said.

During his 22 December press conference, Duggan downplayed the health threat, stating that there would only be a risk “if you were to dig through the foot of topsoil and spend a lot of time digging in the dirt.”

Burton said hazardous waste sites are capped with specialized liners or several feet of clay, which Detroit has not put in place. Burton added: “I don't buy what the mayor said.

“Anything that is near the surface is going to be a hazard to the neighborhood,” Burton said. “I think the mayor is just trying to get people off his back.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Greene gives lengthy interview with New York Times days before stepping down as congresswoman for Georgia

Marjorie Taylor Greene, now just days away from stepping down as a congresswoman for Georgia, has said in her latest mea culpa interview that she “was just so naive” for believing that Donald Trump was a man of the people.

In a lengthy interview with the New York Times that examines her break with the president after years of devotion, Greene explained that a series of minor ruptures with the president culminated in a total breach after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was killed in September.

The third-term Georgia congresswoman said she was watching Kirk's memorial service on TV when his widow Erika said she forgave her husband's killer. But then Trump took the stage to say that unlike Kirk – “a missionary with a noble spirit” who did not “hate” his opponents, Trump said he disagreed.

“I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them,” Trump said.

Greenesaid: “That was absolutely the worst statement. It just shows where his heart is. And that's the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”

Green said that her turn away from unrepentant Maga acolyte came in that moment and she abandoned her training “to never apologize and to never admit when you're wrong”.

“As a Christian, I don't believe in doing that,” she said. “I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.” Greene said she later told a friend that after Kirk died, “I realized that I'm part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”

The Maga landscape post-Kirk has been showing signs of fracture, and Greene has found herself at odds with administration and Republican positions, declaring the war in Gaza a “genocide” as well as casting doubt on economic, healthcare and foreign policy positions that she says do not prioritize working-class Americans.

“I was just so naive and outside of politics,” Greene said, adding: “It was easy for me to naively believe.”

Her break with Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress was, she told the Times, completed over a vote to release investigative files related to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Greene said the Epstein files represented “everything wrong with Washington” and said it was a story of “rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. And the women are the victims”.

After meeting with victims, she claimed, Trump called her and yelled “my friends will get hurt” if the files were released.

In the interview, Greene said that she had been wrong to accuse Democrats of treason. She acknowledged that she is now a political outcast from both sides of the political divide.

“I'm, like, radioactive,” she acknowledged.

“Everyone's like, ‘She's changed,'” Greene added. “I haven't changed my views. But I've matured. I've developed depth. I've learned Washington, and I've come to understand the brokenness of the place.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Nearly half of Americans believe their financial security is getting worse, poll finds","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/29/americans-financial-security-economy-poll","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Exclusive poll: Americans are also increasingly blaming the White House for their financial woes

Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.

The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump's efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.

Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it's getting better.

57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.

The US is not experiencing a recession, which is typically defined as two quarters of negative growth. And last week, the US posted far stronger than expected economic growth figures for the summer months.

But the pessimism underscores an economically tumultuous year. Americans have reported feeling shaken by Trump's tariffs, mass government layoffs and a crackdown on immigration. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence has dropped for five consecutive months.

The White House has insisted that it's “bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin”, as Trump said in a mid-December speech. “Now, under our leadership, [prices] are all coming down – and they're coming down fast,” the president said.

The new Harris poll underscores the sharp differences between political party, gender, race and income that shape how people see the current state of the economy. Republicans scored Joe Biden's handling of the economy far more harshly than Democrats during his term.

The stark divisions between Democrats and Republicans continue to persist. Democrats are almost twice as likely as Republicans to say their financial security is getting worse – 52% versus 27%.

But more concerningly for Republicans, who will have to fight next year to keep their majority in Congress, Trump hasn't been able to sway independents. A majority (54%) of independents said their financials are worsening, +9% compared with February's polling. Most independents (58%) also believe the country is experiencing a recession.

And more of the blame is being placed on the White House than ever before. When asked to choose between the government or corporations for the question “who is most responsible for any increasing prices”:

76% of Democrats said it was government management of the economy, +17% from February's poll.

72% of independents also pointed to the government, +14% from February.

Republicans were less likely to point to the government, with 55% saying it was government (-6% compared to February) and 45% blaming corporate practices.

Analysis after the 2024 election showed Trump gain with women and Hispanic voters. But in another worrying sign for Republicans, over the course of his first year, these voters have soured on the economy.

While Americans overall have grown more pessimistic this year, women are far less confident about the economy than men. Nearly two-thirds of women (62%) believe the US is experiencing a recession, +12% from February, compared with 52% of men who believe the same. And half of women (50%) believe their financial security is getting worse while 39% of men believe the same.

Stark racial gaps are seen for beliefs on the overall state of the US economy. Two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters (66% and 67%, respectively) think the US is in a recession, compared with 52% of white voters. The jump for Hispanic voters was +11% from February, the highest jump among any race.

The poll also highlighted what some economists have referred to as the K-shaped economy – the divide in economic sentiment between wealthy Americans, who are the largest beneficiaries of a booming stock market, and everyone else. Of those who are making less than $50,000 a year, 59% said their financial security is getting worse, +13% compared to February's poll. In comparison, 37% of those making over $100,000 said things are getting worse.

This survey was conducted online within the US by The Harris Poll from 11 to 13 December 2025, among a nationally representative sample of 2,180 US adults.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Officials said a train accident in southern Mexico killed at least 13 people and injured dozens, halting traffic along a rail line connecting the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico. 

The Interoceanic Train linking the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz on Sunday went off the rails as it passed a curve near the town of Nizanda. 

“The Mexican Navy has informed me that, tragically, 13 people died in the Interoceanic Train accident,” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum posted on X, adding that 98 people are injured, five of them seriously.

She said she instructed the Mexican Secretary of the Navy and a Ministry of the Interior undersecretary to travel to the site and assist the families. 

In a message on X on Sunday, Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara said several government agencies had reached the site of the accident to assist the injured. 

Officials said that 241 passengers and nine crew members were on the train when the accident occurred. 

The Interoceanic Train was inaugurated in 2023 by then Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The rail service is part of a broader push to boost train travel in southern Mexico, and develop infrastructure along the isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

Islamic State (IS) militants yesterday clashed with police in northwest Turkey, leaving three police officers and six militants dead, the Turkish minister of the interior said. 

At least eight other police officers and a night guard were wounded. 

The shooting occurred in Elmali district in Yalova, south of Istanbul, as police stormed a house where the militants were hiding.

Special forces from neighboring Bursa were dispatched to reinforce the operation. 

Turkish Minister of the Interior Ali Yerlikaya said the operation in Yalova was one out of more than 100 simultaneous raids carried out against IS suspects in 15 provinces across the country. 

The operation in Yalova was carried out with “great care,” because women and children were inside the house where the militants were located, he said. 

All five women and six children were safely evacuated from the house, he added. 

All the militants were Turkish nationals, he told reporters. 

The operation began at about 2am and was officially completed at 9:40am, he said. 

Meanwhile, the Yalova Chief Public Prosecutor's Office launched an investigation, assigning five prosecutors to lead the probe, Turkish Minister of Justice Yilmaz Tunc said on social media. 

Five people have been taken into custody as part of the investigation, Yilmaz said, without providing further information on the suspects. 

As the confrontation spread into the streets, five schools in the area were closed for the day, private news channel NTV reported earlier. 

Authorities also cut off natural gas and electricity supplies as a precaution while civilians and vehicles were barred from entering the neighborhood, it said. 

Last week, police launched scores of simultaneous raids, detaining 115 militants of the extremist group who were allegedly planning attacks targeting Christmas and New Year's celebrations. Officials said the group had called for action, particularly against non-Muslims, during the celebrations. 

IS has carried out a series of deadly attacks in Turkey over the past few years, including a shooting at an Istanbul nightclub during New Year celebrations on Jan. 1, 2017, which killed 39 people.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Explosions reportedly rocked the Khanskaya military airfield near the southern Russian city of Maykop as air defenses were engaged early on Dec. 29.

Local residents reported explosions within the city and an attack on the nearby airfield, according to independent outlet Astra.

Maykop is located approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) from Ukraine and about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Meanwhile, air raid sirens reportedly went off in Russia's western Tula Oblast amid the threat of a ballistic missile attack, Telegram channel ExileNova+ reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry later claimed it shot down 89 Ukrainian drones late on Dec. 28 and overnight on Dec. 29 amid the reported explosions.

The claims could not be independently verified, and Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the attack.

Kyiv regularly strikes Russian military targets in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

On Dec. 25, Ukraine's Air Force struck the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia's Rostov Oblast using U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles, the General Staff said.

Rostov Oblast Governor Yury Slyusar confirmed explosions in Novoshakhtinsk but did not identify which facility was hit.

On Dec. 14, a Ukrainian missile attack on the Russian city of Belgorod caused ""serious damage"" to local infrastructure, Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed.

""As a result of the bombardment, there is serious damage to the engineering infrastructure,"" he said on social media. ""Emergency and operational services are engaged in eliminating the consequences.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","Bringing art to the cemetery — How 'The Invisible Gallery' reclaims legacy overshadowed by Russian imperialism","https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-art-masters-how-the-invisible-gallery-reclaims-overshadowed-legacy/","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:00:09 GMT","

In Ukraine's cemeteries, some graves are more than symbols of memory. They hold the truth about the country's enduring place in European culture, testifying to centuries of creative achievement and innovation — and to the lengths Russia has gone to obscure and even try to steal that legacy.

""The Invisible Gallery,"" a new cultural initiative that highlights the lives of eight Ukrainian artists, seeks to bring greater attention to Ukraine's historical contributions to the art world. Through a guided tour of Lukianivske Cemetery in Kyiv, visitors can discover how these artists contributed to art amid empire collapse, war, and repression.

""Russia's long-standing colonial policy toward Ukraine has historically led many Ukrainian artists to be mistakenly associated with Russian culture, or for their legacy to have been suppressed in the USSR,"" said journalist Darka Hirna, who conceived the project.

""The ongoing full-scale war has intensified discussions in Ukrainian society about these artists and how they often had no choice but to study and work in Russia, yet still identified themselves with Ukrainian culture.""

In order to realize Hirna's idea for ""The Invisible Gallery,"" The Ukrainians Media teamed up with Lady Di Atelier, Lukianivske Cemetery, and the National Art Museum of Ukraine. An interactive website allows people to explore their legacies in greater depth.

There are around 40 artists buried at the cemetery in total. However, ""The Invisible Gallery"" focuses specifically on artists Oleksandr Bohomazov, Mykola Murashko, Viktor Palmov, Fedir Krychevskyi, Oleksandr Murashko, Volodymyr Orlovskyi, Serhii Sviatoslavskyi, and Mykola Pymonenko.

Mykola Murashko (1844–1909) was a founder of the Kyiv Drawing School and authored some of the earliest manuals for art students in Ukraine.

Volodymyr Orlovskyi (1842–1914) is considered one of the founders of Ukrainian Realist landscape painting, while Serhii Sviatoslavskyi (1857–1931) specifically excelled in plein air landscape painting, capturing Ukrainian outdoor life with atmospheric sensitivity. 

Realist painter Mykola Pymonenko (1862–1912) documented urban and rural Ukrainian life with ethnographic precision, and among his students was a young Kazimir Malevich.

Oleksandr Murashko (1875–1919), nephew of Mykola Murashko, studied under Ilya Repin at the Imperial Academy of Arts before evolving from realism into a vivid, colorful Impressionism influenced by his time in Munich and Paris. His psychologically penetrating portraits, including the iconic ""Girl in a Red Hat"", established him as one of Ukraine's most famous artists. 

Fedir Krychevskyi (1879–1947), an early modernist painter who synthesized Ukrainian folk traditions with European modernism, also became one of the founders and rector of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts. 

Oleksandr Bohomazov (1880–1930) emerged as a leading figure in Ukraine's avant-garde scene, developing a distinctive Cubo-Futurist style that fragmented form and color into dynamic, energetic compositions. Viktor Palmov (1888–1929) pushed avant-garde experimentation even further through bold color contrasts and expressive techniques that challenged conventional artistic approaches.

The lives of these eight artists spanned periods of massive upheaval for both Ukraine and the world, including World War I triggering the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Ukrainian War of Independence from 1917 to 1921, the Communist authorities' establishment of the Ukrainian SSR in 1922, the Great Terror of the 1930s under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and the mass devastation caused by World War II.

Informational plaques featuring each of the eight artists draw visitors from the hush of the cemetery into their lives and the periods they inhabited.

""The priority (of this project) was the visual appeal of the informational plaques at the cemetery and ensuring that interacting with them was enjoyable and convenient,"" Kateryna Samboryk, co-creator and producer of ""The Invisible Gallery,"" told the Kyiv Independent.

As the project's launch approached, the creators of the project realized it needed to begin with an immersive debut tour that would emphasize the appeal of visiting the cemetery — a task for which they enlisted the help of the cemetery staff. This included a woman whom the creators of the project affectionately refer to as Ms. Oksana.

""Ms. Oksana revealed to attendees (of the tour) details about the artists' burials, how they lived, what they did for their country beyond creating incredible paintings, as well as information about their families, estates, and the sculptures on their graves,"" Samboryk said.

""In the spring, we plan to expand the series of tours and reach an even larger audience.""

By drawing visitors' attention to these artists' through visits to their graves, Hirna hopes the project will do more than revive interest in their work. She also aims to spotlight a larger vision — a public discussion about Ukraine's need to cultivate its own kind of Pantheon.

""We are used to the fact that many of the graves of our state builders and prominent public and cultural figures are scattered across cemeteries around the world due to the terrible events of the 20th century,"" she said.

In France, the Pantheon serves as a secular mausoleum, a place where the country's most celebrated writers, scientists, and political figures are laid to rest, their collective achievements enshrined as a testament to their impact on French society.

Embracing this European tradition of cultural memory, ""in which a historical cemetery is not only a place of mourning but also a cultural space,"" would help strengthen Ukrainian society during one of its most difficult periods, according to Hirna.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army on Monday announced large-scale military drills around Taiwan, in what a spokesperson said was a “stern warning” to the autonomous, democratically ruled island. 

A map released by the PLA showed operations in five areas encircling Taiwan, including in the northern part of the Taiwan Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. 

A statement said air, rocket, army and naval-force troops had been dispatched to take part in the drills, code-named “Justice Mission 2025,” with the bulk of exercises due to take place Tuesday. 

Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theatre Command, said Beijing was sending a “stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces,” adding that the drills were a “legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity.” 

China's military moved army, naval, air force and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its 'Justice Mission 2025' drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilized troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.

Ruled separately from China's mainland since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, and independent for much of its history, Taiwan is nevertheless claimed by Beijing as an integral part of its territory and China has threatened to annex it by force. 

Under President Xi Jinping, as public opinion in Taiwan has moved decisively against any unification with China, Beijing has ramped up diplomatic and military pressure against Taipei. It has picked off Taiwan's few official allies, excluded its government from international fora, and staged aerial, naval and missile drills around the island. 

With calls to Xi and Takaichi, Trump wades into Japan-China spat over Taiwan

Recent months have been particularly tense after Beijing reacted furiously to comments by new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi that Tokyo would regard any invasion of Taiwan as an “existential threat,” that could justify the deployment of Japan's Self-Defence Forces. 

Weeks of intense pressure and boycotts did nothing to shake Tokyo's resolve however, and eventually prompted Washington, which had largely stayed out of the dispute amid efforts to improve relations with China, to publicly state its support for close ally Japan. 

This was followed by a record US$10-billion arms sale to Taiwan, including medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones. The arms are similar to what the U.S. has previously provided Ukraine, with many in Taiwan seeing that country's resistance as a potential model for any future defence against a Chinese invasion. 

Speaking to a Taiwanese broadcaster Sunday, the island's leader, William Lai, said if Beijing was considering invasion, “then we have only one choice: to keep raising the difficulty.”

“Crossing the sea is itself a difficult challenge,” Mr. Lai said. “When Russia invaded Ukraine, it simply drove tanks in directly.”

He warned that Taiwan “cannot be complacent” and must continue to build up its defence capabilities – a scenario many have described as “Porcupine Taiwan” – while reiterating Taipei's commitment to maintaining the peaceful status quo that has lasted for more than seven decades. 

China's Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. arms sale, saying Taipei was “squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg.” 

“This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. 

“The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.” 

A graphic released by the PLA on Monday appeared to reference this, showing two large shields emblazoned with the Great Wall of China on top of a map of Taiwan, warning that “any external interference that touches the shield will lead to destruction!” 

While the PLA has practised blockading missions in the past, this is the first time it has explicitly referenced deterring outside intervention as part of a drill.

FIRE is a personal finance movement which stands for 'financial independence, retire early.'brizmaker/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Kristy Shen retired in her 30s and is an author of the bestselling book Quit Like a Millionaire.

A reader wrote to us recently asking whether to delay her early retirement to spend money on her family and health. She wants IVF fertility treatments to have children, and would like to spend some money on coaching as an endurance athlete.

Neither of those things are cheap. Would it be a good idea to forgo those things to achieve her early retirement FIRE (financial independence, retire early) goal at age 45? After all, she wants to stop working while she's still young. 

As someone who retired in their 30s after working a stressful job and investing for nine years, I understand the allure of having infinite time to pursue your passions, travel the world and spend time doing whatever you want, whenever you want. 

It might seem quite logical to pursue this dream by accumulating money as quickly as possible, even at the detriment of everything else. 

Ten years ago, as a bright-eyed 32-year-old, I would've thought this a noble pursuit. After all, I'd been taught by my mom that “money is the most important thing in the world.” When you grow up living on 44 cents a day, you focus constantly on making more money. 

A summer camp for grown-ups trying to escape the work force forever with FIRE

While I still think FIRE is one of the best things I've pursued, I don't think it's worth sacrificing your relationships and health. 

Money is a tool to help you buy back your time. But what good is free time if you spend it sad, sick or alone?

Even Warren Buffett, one the world's most celebrated investors said in his biography, that the highest measure of success in life comes by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you.

“Some people die filthy rich and get buildings named after them, but the truth is that nobody in the world loves them.”

I understand what he is saying. I feel it whenever my husband laces his fingers through mine as we walk down the street. Whenever my son wraps his sticky fingers around my neck and plants wet kisses on my cheek. Whenever my friends – my chosen family – bring me homemade soup after another harrowing week of household illnesses. 

Instead of thinking of FIRE as a yardstick that measures your life's success, think of it as a well. It gives you a steady source of options. 

You can “draw” on it for financial security when you need to step back from work to spend time with family. Or for when work gets overwhelming, and you need to downshift or pivot to another career for your health. 

It isn't a “one-and-done” goal, but a resource you can continue replenishing and draw from as your life evolves. 

Since water is fluid and adaptable, so are your FIRE plans. You can continue your dreams of building a family, supporting loved ones, or occasionally go back to participating in the working world to earn money rather than closing off the well once you've hit a specific financial target. 

The Decibel: Meet the people who save aggressively to retire early

Replenishing the well and drawing on it in times of need works best when you know your values and priorities. Don't draw from it mindlessly to pay for status symbols that only feed your ego. 

Draw from it to improve your health and water your relationships. Replenish it by forgoing those things you don't care about so you can draw from it for things you do care about. 

Here's how I responded to the reader: “Sacrificing starting a family to achieve FIRE is not worth it. Neither is sacrificing your health. I would rather you retire later with the family you want, and in amazing physical shape, rather than retiring at 45 with no family and in worse health.”

When it comes to FIRE, money is important but it's not everything. Measure your life by love instead of money, and you'll be truly wealthy.

Experts say taxes, lifestyle factors and immigration rules are just some of the reasons Canadians with dreams of moving abroad end up staying put.Illustration by Photo illustration by The Globe and Mail/Getty Images/iStockphoto

Lawyers and financial planners across the country are fielding more calls from Canadians asking what it would take to leave the country. But while interest in emigrating appears to be rising, many of those inquiries never turn into an actual move. 

Rahul Sharma, a partner at law firm Fasken, describes many would-be emigrants as “tire kickers.” They're typically wealthy Canadians over the age of 50 who explore their options, imagine a different lifestyle and shop around for a new country, only to stay put in Canada once they confront the true costs and legal complexity of leaving.

But there are some calls that come in that do turn into action. Professionals who spoke with The Globe and Mail say the more meaningful outflow from the country is happening earlier, among young entrepreneurs with early traction who leave before they ever build or register significant wealth in Canada. 

“I think we should be alarmed about these individuals and their desire to leave,” Mr. Sharma said. He has seen many young people want to go because they “simply do not see Canada as providing them with an environment in which to succeed at the entrepreneurial level.”

That concern comes as Canada appears to be losing some of its appeal among high-net-worth individuals more broadly, according to a 2025 report from advisory firm Henley & Partners. Using data from research firm New World Wealth, the report estimates Canada will see a net inflow of about 1,000 wealthy migrants in 2025, the lowest figure on record.

Experts who spoke to The Globe and Mail said common reasons for wanting to leave the country include dissatisfaction with quality of life and concerns about the economic outlook in Canada.

Still, the most persistent driver among middle-aged wealthy Canadians is taxes, said Brandon Davies, founder of Clarity Cross Border, a financial planning firm, and a financial planner certified in both Canada and the United States.

He said that many wealthy Canadians feel “disadvantaged” by the high tax rates they are subject to. In Ontario, for example, the surtax on personal income can reach 56 per cent. For some, the idea of relocating to a lower-tax jurisdiction is tempting, especially when they compare potential savings abroad to the heavy tax burden at home.

Mr. Davies said that lifestyle factors weigh heavily, too. Canada's harsh winters are a major consideration, particularly for older residents or those seeking a more relaxed, outdoor-oriented lifestyle. “They want to be the people on a yacht while others are shovelling snow,” he said.

For young entrepreneurs, Greg Moore, a partner at Richter Family Office, which manages many high-net-worth clients, said many want to be surrounded by people similar to them. They can often find that in the United States, in places such as Silicon Valley. 

“You also have an environment where raising capital is a lot easier,” Mr. Moore said, referring to the U.S. “There's a lot more money around willing to flow into venture capital to support these young entrepreneurs. There's a culture of risk-taking that is more evident within the United States.”

A recent study from Toronto venture-capital firm Leaders Fund found that just 32.4 per cent of Canadian-led “high-potential” startups launched in 2024 were headquartered in this country. The survey defined these startups as having raised US$1-million, with most of their senior leaders educated in Canada, and tracked 2,932 such companies over a decade.

“All of that creates an environment which is much more supportive of entrepreneurs,” Mr. Moore said.

But the reality of emigrating is often far more complicated than clients expect. “It's not as easy as packing up your bags and leaving,” said Jenna Schwartz, a partner at Richter.

One of the biggest obstacles to leaving the country is the departure tax.

When someone emigrates, the Canada Revenue Agency treats certain assets as if they were sold on the day they leave – a “deemed disposition” that can produce tax bills in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. While the tax can be deferred, Ms. Schwartz said doing so requires months, and sometimes years, of planning.

Flee Canada? Companies considering a U.S. move quickly learn it's costly and complicated – and can even backfire

The process becomes even more complex for business owners. Shares must be valued, and departure tax may be owed on those shares, even if the business is not being sold. “That isn't always an exercise that everyone wants to do, particularly if they're not actually looking to sell that business,” she said.

If a business is moved and begins operating in the U.S., the company itself becomes a separate taxpayer subject to a different regulatory regime, Ms. Schwartz said.

After confronting those realities, many clients reconsider. “They take a sober second look and say, ‘Okay, is this really something that I want to do?' ” Ms. Schwartz said. Often, the answer is no, she said.

Young entrepreneurs tend to face fewer obstacles, and that's why they are the ones who typically end up leaving Canada, experts say. With smaller portfolios and fewer family obligations, they often incur less departure tax and may not need to move an established business, Ms. Schwartz said.

Then there's health care. While Canada's system covers most medical costs, emigrants often face steep private insurance premiums abroad. For clients moving to the U.S., annual coverage can easily exceed $20,000. “I can't tell you how many times I have seen the sticker shock on a client's face when I explained that to them” for U.S. health care costs, Mr. Davies said.

Immigration rules can be another deterrent, he added. It's not easy to move to a different country, and visas may be temporary or tied to employment, making it difficult to move an entire family. The holders of TN visas, which permit qualified Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the U.S., for example, must leave if they lose their job, and spouses may not be permitted to work.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Climate coverage shrinks amid Trump's clean energy misinfo","https://www.dw.com/en/climate-coverage-shrinks-amid-trumps-clean-energy-misinformation/a-75026829","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 08:37:30 GMT","

A strong majority of Americans say they're worried about the climate. So why do they hear so little about it in the news?

Some 89% of people worldwide say they want more action on the climate crisis. Nearly seven in 10 note they would donate 1% of their income to help. In the US, two-thirds are at least somewhat worried about global warming.

And yet, Americans hear remarkably little about a crisis reshaping the global economy, displacing populations, worsening extreme weather, and affecting nearly every facet of daily life. More than half say they receive news about climate change several times a year or less, according to a 2025 Yale Program on Climate Change Communication report.

""If the media's not reporting the issue of climate change, it's out of sight and out of mind for people,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program.

The problem has become even more acute at a time when the US president is openly hostile to the scientific consensus on climate change. Donald Trump and his allies have pushed misleading narratives about the trade-offs of green energy, drawing reporters into covering false controversies instead of facts and making the job of reporting harder.

""The Trump administration is playing reporters like a fiddle on the issue of trade-offs"" by bringing up red herrings and sending reporters down rabbit holes, Jael Holzman, a climate reporter at Heatmap News, told DW.

Among President Trump's misleading claims is that offshore wind projects are ""driving the whales crazy"" and are the hidden cause of the marine mammals washing up dead.

Scientists, however, say there is no known link between the two, noting that vessel strikes and fishing-gear entanglements are the primary causes. Nonetheless, numerous stories still give airtime to unsubstantiated concerns from politicians and community groups, understandably worried about whales.

A similar dynamic emerged after the major fire at California's Moss Landing battery facility when Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA, the federal agency tasked with protecting the environment, visited Long Island to criticize New York's push for battery storage infrastructure.

But remarks by Trump-appointee Zeldin, and much of the subsequent reporting, omitted context that the incident likely stemmed from outdated technology, not representative of much of the country's newer battery-storage facilities.

""The impact of the Trump administration on the coverage is intentional,"" said Holzman, adding that tactics to delay progress on climate change have overtaken outright denialism.

""They don't need everyone to deny the existence of climate change — they just need enough people to deny the importance of dealing with it now.""

Beyond spreading misleading claims, the administration has made it harder for reporters to access the data needed to provide accurate context in the first place.

Holzman described how a government dashboard she used to track progress on environmental regulations mysteriously went dark for more than a month.

""There's just a lot of unexpected chicanery and shenanigans,"" she said.

The team behind climate.gov, a popular federal clearinghouse for climate information about weather, sea level and temperature rise, was fired this summer and users were redirected to a new site, which is no longer being updated. The previous team has since been attempting to relaunch the site.

The EPA has also erased references to human activity being the main driver of climate change, instead focusing on ""natural processes"" such as volcanic eruptions and variations in solar activity. 

""Climate change has been scrubbed from government websites, they've taken down a number of major data sets, they are killing off programs at NASA that are devoted to climate change,"" said Leiserowitz at Yale, referencing the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, a pair of NASA missions that monitor greenhouse gas emissions, and which the administration wants to cancel.

""The US has been a major source of climate information, climate modeling, and so on, and that is having a chilling effect,"" he added.

Still, Trump's return to office is not the only reason for a global dip in climate news coverage. It was on a steady-if-rocky incline throughout the 21st century before peaking in 2021 around the time the Biden administration was debating its landmark climate law.

But coverage fell precipitously the next year and has continued to slide downward, according to the Media and Climate Change Observatory, which monitors mentions of the issue in five major American newspapers, seven television stations, two radio networks and two wire services.

Several reasons are at play. Traditional media outlets have been in long-term decline over the last two decades, consistently losing money and readers. Since 2005, close to 3,500 local newspapers have vanished, according to a Northwestern University study.

Corporate consolidation and evaporating ad revenue have forced tighter budgets and repeated layoffs, squeezing coverage of complex beats like science and climate.

In 2023, CNBC laid off Cat Clifford, who helped found the network's climate desk and wrote that other layoffs had left it ""fundamentally dismantled"" with no dedicated staff covering the issue.

And even when the media does cover climate change, stories must navigate an algorithm-driven information ecosystem that filters news through partisan biases and amplifies disinformation before it ever reaches readers.

That ecosystem rewards Trump's stream of provocative statements — what reporters call a ""fire hose of attention"" strategy — frequently drowning out climate coverage.

Climate change is competing with ""news and entertainment and sports and your kid saying they want ice cream, and everything else going on in our lives that's demanding our attention,"" said Leiserowitz.

Despite the downturn, climate journalism has come a long way over the last few decades.

Sadie Babits remembers the early years of climate journalism well. She filed her first environmental story in 2000 as an intern at Boise State Public Radio, reporting on Montana wildfires when the science linking extreme weather to human activity was still emerging. Back then, any story about climate change required both scientific voices and climate change deniers in the name of 'both-sidesism.'

Today, Babits is the senior supervising climate editor at NPR — a position that did not exist at the start of her career — joining legacy outlets like ​The New York Times, ​​The Washington Post and ​The Associated Press in building and maintaining dedicated climate desks. New niche outlets such as Holzman's ​Heatmap News, Canary Media, ​Latitude Media, ​​The Cool Down and more have sprouted up in the last five years.

""If people weren't interested in these topics, then I wouldn't have a job,"" Holzman said. ""I have readers so religiously interested in every word that I write that I have fans that come up to me in bars.""

Even in a year when Congress cut all federal support for NPR over accusations of liberal bias, Babits said the outlet has not changed its approach.

""We see this as a critical story of our time,"" she said. ""We have not backed down from the kind of work that we would be doing in any other year.""

Germany's perennial debate over safety has flared up once again as fireworks sales resume ahead of New Year. Meanwhile, a spate of black ice has caused numerous accidents across the country. Follow our updates.

Below is a roundup of the main headlines from Germany during the Christmas and New Year week:

The Berliner Stadmission protestant charity has praised the response after two of its three ""cold buses"" providing winter assistance to the homeless in the German capital were put out of action by a fire, with arson suspected. 

""We are overwhelmed by the people's solidarity,"" spokeswoman Barbara Breuer told Germany's DPA news agency, a day after the news of the fire first broke in the city. ""Other organizations and businesses from Berlin have offered their assistance.""

Breuer said initial donations had already come in, though she could not yet provide a precise tally. 

""The cold bus trips are assured again, and we are utterly grateful,"" she said.

The Berliner Stadtmission provides various assistance from more than 70 sites in and around the Berlin diocese, particularly to those in more extreme need or poverty.   

One of the minibuses was found totally burned out on Sunday, with another one parked next to it sustaining minor damage that will put it out of service temporarily. 

Police said they had launched an investigation on suspicion of arson. 

Volunteers use the vehicles on cold winter nights to tour the city, providing hot food and drinks and other assistance like sleeping bags and blankets, as well as transporting some of them to shelters for the night. 

Berlin is typically one of the colder cities in northern Germany, and freezing temperatures are currently forecast overnight on Monday and Tuesday, with the possibility of snow in the early hours of Wednesday.

City authorities estimate that just over 53,000 people were in homeless accommodation or other shelters in Berlin as of the start of 2025. The less reliable estimates for the number of people sleeping on the streets have not yet been published. But in 2024, that figure stood at just over 6,000.

Police in northern Germany are investigating vandalism of a local AfD office in the town of Wismar, after damage was reported on Monday, the first working weekday after the Christmas period. 

""The incident took place during the course of the Christmas holidays, between December 23 at around 2 p.m. and December 29 and 11 a.m.,"" the police precinct in nearby Rostock, which is the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania's most populous city, said in a statement. 

Two windows had been smashed by as yet unidentified suspects, causing damages worth in the region of €2,000 (roughly $2,350), according to police. 

Officers had gathered evidence that was being examined, with investigations ongoing, police said. 

Rostock police have reported thieves targeting fireworks deliveries to supermarkets in the run-up to New Year in three locations innorthern Germany. 

Police said in a statement on Monday that ""as yet unknown perpetrators"" had ""forcibly secured access to a total of three freight containers"" — in Sievershagen on the outskirts of Rostock, in Kritzow to the west of Rostock, and in Lübz to the south. 

The fireworks were being stored in containers ready for distribution to local supermarkets for the annual New Year's exemption on sales restrictions, police said. 

Citing preliminary investigations, police said they believed the materials had been stolen during the Christmas bank holiday period. 

They said that details on the costs in terms of stolen materials and damaged property were not yet ready, but cited the affected company in Lübz as saying that the fireworks stolen at that location had been worth at least €12,000 (roughly $14,150) by themselves.

Police appealed for potential witnesses at any of the three locations to come forward.

Police have seized 330 kilograms (about 730 pounds) of fireworks from a man's cellar on Berlin's Landsberger Allee after he bragged about the stash at a Christmas party.

According to a Facebook post by police, the man told guests he kept large quantities of fireworks in his basement and occasionally sold some of them.

Germany's top criminal police official has warned that a possible role in state government for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could jeopardize the flow of sensitive information between police agencies.

Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) President Holger Münch told the newspaper Tagesspiegel that if the party entered government, it could gain access to protected data, with consequences for cooperation between federal and state criminal police offices.

Münch said the issue was not about drastic steps such as deleting files. ""But we have to think about how openly we could then share information within the network,"" he said, raising questions about risks and how authorities would deal with them.

His comments come as five state elections are due in Germany in 2026, including in the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the AfD is polling close to 40%. It is not ruled out that the party could produce its first state premier by the end of next year.

In the same interview, Münch warned that Germany's role as a strong supporter of Ukraine has put it increasingly in the focus of Russian intelligence efforts aimed at weakening democracy. Münch said the number of investigations involving Russian actors at the federal prosecutor's office has risen sharply.

Germany has approved far fewer arms exports this year after two consecutive record highs, government data show.

Between January 1 and December 8, 2025, export licenses for weapons and other military equipment totaled €8.40 billion ($9.88 billion), according to a response from the Economy Ministry to a parliamentary query from the socialist Left Party.

That's a big drop compared with €13.33 billion in 2024 and €12.15 billion in 2023.

The sharpest fall has been in approvals for Ukraine. Licenses for exports to Kyiv amounted to €1.14 billion this year, down from €8.15 billion in 2024. However, the Economy Ministry said the decline does not signal a pullback in support.

A spokesperson said some aid is still being delivered under licenses granted earlier, while other funds are tied up in long-term projects that will only show up later in export approvals. Not all military assistance requires export licenses, and Ukraine is also investing more in domestic arms production, the ministry said.

Of the total, €5.39 billion in export approvals fall under the current government's tenure. Norway ranks first among recipient countries with €1.31 billion, likely driven by large orders for tanks and submarines. Turkey follows with €726 million, ahead of Ukraine at €483 million.

Medical representatives, police officers, the German Children's Fund, environmental and animal welfare groups, and other organizations are calling for a general ban on the use of pyrotechnics.

Among others, the president of the German Medical Association, Klaus Reinhardt, has pointed to the serious injuries many people suffer every year from exploding fireworks and to overcrowded hospital emergency departments. However, the interior ministers of the federal and state governments have recently failed to agree on a ban on private pyrotechnics.

Germany's GdP police union warned of having too few emergency personnel on New Year's Eve and called for more firework bans and protected zones in cities. Emergency services fear that officers on duty could once again be attacked with fireworks. ""Increasingly, people are becoming reckless and are misusing legal items such as firecrackers or rockets,"" GdP chairman Jochen Kopelke told the DPA news agency.

Reckless use of fireworks cost five men their lives in Germany on last New Year's Evealone. Numerous people suffered, in some cases, severe injuries. Particularly devastating effects were caused by homemade explosive devices and illegal spherical fireworks.

Animal welfare groups warn of the negative effects on animals. Cats and dogs are put under stress, wild animals are startled and use up valuable energy that they need to survive the winter.

Environmental groups, in turn, criticize the littering of the environment and the waste of resources.

Germany's largest listed companies are still feeling the strain of the weak economy, with profits falling sharply despite slightly higher revenues.

An analysis by consultancy EY (Ernst & Young) shows that operating profit at the 100 highest-revenue companies dropped 15% year on year to €102 billion (about $120 billion) in the first nine months.

More than half of the companies earned less than a year earlier, marking the third consecutive decline in profits.
EY said the negative trend has become entrenched, even as turnover offered a rare glimmer of relief.

EY partner Jan Brorhilker said 2025 had been ""another crisis year"" for Germany's economy.

Weak growth, geopolitical tensions, US trade policy, and rising competition from Chinese firms were weighing on investment decisions, he said, hitting export-oriented industrial groups particularly hard.

The difficult environment is also showing up in employment figures. Between January and September, the combined workforces of the top 100 shrank by about 17,500 jobs, a decline of 0.4% to roughly 4.24 million employees worldwide.

The sale of rockets and firecrackers for the New Year period has begun again — for a limited time only.

Pyrotechnics for New Year's Eve may be sold for a few days only at the end of December, with sales this year beginning from the moment shops opened on Monday. Online retailers are allowed to deliver pre-ordered fireworks to customers' homes during the last three working days of the year.

The sales are not universally popular, with an unusual coalition of medical experts, police officers, environmental and animal rights activists calling for a general ban. After a New Year's Eve marked by deaths and injuries last time around, 270,000 Germans signed an online petition calling for a nationwide ban on private fireworks.

Despite this, the Association of the Pyrotechnics Industry (VPI) expects 10 to 15% more goods to be available in stores compared with last year. In 2024, the industry reported sales of €197 million (up from €180 million in 2023) and hopes to increase this figure slightly.

The firecracker industry has said it sees growing demand for ""visually impressive display fireworks, especially compound fireworks and firework batteries."" These products now account for more than 50% of total industry revenue.

Welcome back to our coverage.

It's been a quiet few days as the ""turn of the year"" (or ""jahreswechsel"" in German) usually is. 

We'll continue to bring you the latest news from Germany in this blog as they happen.

Black ice created hazardous road conditions across Germany overnight, leading to numerous traffic accidents.

By early Sunday, police in the eastern state of Saxony had recorded 32 accidents, with further incidents reported nationwide.

The icy conditions also strained medical facilities. In Berlin, hospital emergency departments were overcapacity due to an increase in patients with fractures caused by icy conditions, according to newspaper Tagesspiegel.

The German Weather Service said slippery conditions were expected to continue until mid-morning, with freezing drizzle possible in central regions, before warmer temperatures melted the ice.

Several serious crashes were reported in Saxony and Hesse, including vehicle rollovers and collisions caused by loss of control on icy roads. Police also reported many accidents on Friday night and Saturday, particularly in northern Germany.

Welcome back to our coverage of all things Germany.

Bonn is wrapped in mist this Sunday morning, and as tradition goes, it's a ""ruhetag"", a day for slowing down and taking it easy.

That doesn't mean the news stops, though.

If something happens, you'll find it right here.

We'll be back again on Sunday morning with the latest news in Germany.

The head of Germany's central medical professional body has called for an urgent ban on private firework displays ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations.

""No one has anything against organized fireworks displays in central locations, but illegal fireworks must be banned,"" Klaus Reinhardt, president of the German Medical Association, told the RND media group in comments published Saturday.

Reinhardt said a ban had ""nothing to do with a culture of prohibition,"" but instead reflected ""the maturity of a society that understands when to refrain from something dangerous.""

Public concerns about violent incidents involving fireworks, unintentional injuries and animal welfare are growing in Germany after New Year's Eve celebrations in cities such as Berlin and Munich turned into scenes of chaos.

Fireworks can only be sold legally from December 29 to December 31 in Germany.

Supporters of a ban include the GdP police union, which has warned that officers and other first responders are often targeted with fireworks during celebrations.

Reinhardt noted that fireworks often lead to serious injuries, including blast trauma, eye injuries and burns.

Opponents of a ban insist that emergency rooms are full on New Year's Eve because of alcohol consumption, not fireworks. They argue that home fireworks are a key part of the festivities.

""We have a tradition of celebrating New Year's Eve this way,"" Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder, a member of the conservative CDU party, told the Funke media group.

Roadways in Germany were slippery on Saturday morning because of freezing temperatures and black ice, especially in the north and east of the country.

Early in the morning, there was an accident on the icy Autobahn 1 in the northwestern state of Lower Saxony.

According to police reports, five people sustained minor injuries. The police said a total of seven vehicles collided near Wildeshausen in the Oldenburg district.

A mother and her child were involved in a rollover accident in the district of Cloppenburg in Lower Saxony when their car skidded off a slippery road around a bend in the morning, according to a police spokeswoman. The 22-year-old woman was treated in hospital for minor injuries. The eight-month-old baby was unharmed.

According to preliminary police reports, approximately 120 traffic accidents have been recorded in the eastern state of Brandenburg since Friday evening. Nineteen people were injured. In almost all cases, cars slid out of control on icy conditions.

In addition, no buses were running in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, in the morning due to freezing temperatures. ""Due to weather conditions, bus service in the Potsdam city area is currently suspended,"" Potsdam's public utility company said.

Meanwhile, in the eastern half of the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, there were more than a dozen accidents during the night because of icy conditions on roadways.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

The Turkish Interior Ministry mourned the loss of thee security force members as police moved in on a suspected hideout. Six Islamist militants were reported to have been killed in the operation.

Turkey's interior minister said three police officers and six members of the ""Islamic State"" (IS) militant group were killed on Monday during a clash in northwest Turkey.

The operation follows nationwide raids last week in which police detained 115 suspected militants accused of planning attacks around Christmas and New Year's celebrations.

A gunfight broke out in Yalova, south of Istanbul, as police stormed a house where the militants were believed to be hiding.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said eight other police officers and a night guard were wounded during the operation.

Security forces dispatched special units from the neighboring province of Bursa as the operation spread into streets, prompting heightened security measures.

Private broadcaster NTV reported that five schools in the area were closed for the day, while authorities cut natural gas and electricity supplies as a precaution and barred civilians and vehicles from entering the neighborhood.

State news agency Anadolu reported that none of the wounded police officers were in serious condition.

IS has called for action during the holiday period, particularly against non-Muslims, officials said.

The extremist group has carried out several deadly attacks in Turkey in recent years. These included a shooting at an Istanbul nightclub during New Year celebrations on January 1, 2017, that killed 39 people.

The administration's deep cuts to humanitarian assistance come at a time when aid is needed more than ever.

Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. Please support us with a tax-deductible donation today.

The Trump administration on Monday announced a commitment of $2 billion to United Nations humanitarian assistance efforts, a fraction of what the US has previously provided as President Donald Trump's foreign aid cuts continue to wreak deadly havoc worldwide.

The US State Department said the funds will be tied to reform efforts pushed by the administration, as it warns individual UN agencies to “adapt, shrink, or die” — all while giving massive handouts to billionaires.

“The agreement requires the UN to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,” said the State Department.

Al Jazeera reported that the reduced commitment “is a sharp contrast to the assistance of up to $17 billion the US has provided as the UN's leading funder in recent years.”

“The $2 billion will create a pool of funds that can be directed at specific countries or crises, with 17 countries — including Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Syria, and Ukraine — initially targeted,” the outlet noted. “Afghanistan is not included on the list, nor is Palestine, which officials say will be covered by money included in Trump's yet-to-be-completed Gaza plan.”

The Associated Press observed that “even as the US pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought, and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.”

The new funding pledge comes after the Trump administration's lawless dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which was the United States' primary body for foreign aid.

Experts say the destruction of USAID at the hands of billionaire Elon Musk and others inside the Trump White House has killed hundreds of thousands of people across the globe — and could kill millions more in the coming years.

A conservative tracker maintained by Boston University epidemiologist Brooke Nichols estimates that the Trump administration's assault on foreign aid programs has killed more than 700,000 people — a majority of them children.

In a blog post for the Center for Global Development earlier this month, Charles Kenny and Justin Sandefur wrote that “while quantification is difficult, there is little doubt many people have died as a result, and without action many more will die in the future.”

Faster, stealthier missiles, accelerated weapons development, and the threat of an unrestrained nuclear arms race, set against the backdrop of a withering arms control regime, point to a worsening global nuclear threat as 2025 comes to a close. On top of that, just before meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping in October, President Donald Trump abruptly, and very imprecisely announced in a social media post, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”

The suggestion that the United States might break with a more than three decade-long moratorium on explosive tests sparked a global wave of uncertainty, anxiety, and speculation about the impacts of a potential return to explosive nuclear testing. This comes in the final months of a year when five of the world's nine nuclear armed countries have been engaged in active warfare. In May, India and Pakistan attacked each other with missiles, Russia has continuously bombed Ukraine, and the U.S. and Israel bombed Iran and other nations and territories. 

Eighty years after the beginning of the atomic age, the deteriorating nuclear threat landscape is reflected in the symbolic Doomsday Clock, now set at 89 seconds to midnight, its closest-ever setting to global catastrophe, with the last U.S.-Russia arms control treaty expected to expire in early February.

On July 16, the 80th anniversary of the world's first nuclear detonation, a gathering of 60 nuclear weapons experts and around 20 Nobel laureates assembled at the University of Chicago to come up with a list of pragmatic, actionable steps which they are urging world leaders to take to reduce the risk of nuclear war. That two-page document, the Nobel Laureate Declaration, calls for a recommitment to a moratorium on nuclear explosive testing, enhancement and expansion of nuclear diplomacy, and for scientists, academics, communities of faith, and civil society to create pressure on global leaders to take nuclear risk reduction measures.

Five of the nuclear experts and one Nobel laureate who were central to writing the declaration (now signed by 129 Nobel prize winners) spoke to Truthout to discuss what the exercise achieved and what they want to see happen next. Everyone interviewed for this story agreed that nuclear threats have increased in recent months, underscoring the urgent need to reduce risks and begin new conversations.

“That conversation has been picked up by a lot of people around the world but it has not yet, in my opinion, changed the dial, but it is the beginning,” said Brian Schmidt, a professor of astrophysics at Australian National University and a Nobel laureate (2011 physics). “I see it as that first step, and we are now looking at how we do the next steps and keep bringing it up in conversations.”

Schmidt told Truthout that he has spoken to people across the political spectrum from the far left to the far right and “no one has said ‘I think nuclear war would be a good thing.'” Finding ways to reduce nuclear risks, Schmidt said, is “actually something that can be used to bind us together.”

The deteriorating nuclear threat landscape is reflected in the symbolic Doomsday Clock, now set at 89 seconds to midnight, its closest-ever setting to global catastrophe. 

As nuclear nations increase spending and reliance on their arsenals with some people even calling for more countries to acquire nuclear weapons, Laura Grego, senior research director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, was under no illusion that a two-page document alone would change the world, but calls it a necessary step.

“I didn't expect that everybody would put their pens down and say, ‘the laureates have spoken.'” Rather, she compared the declaration to a protest or demonstration which, by itself, does not bring immediate change, but must be part of a longer, sustained effort.

Even as Trump has made ambiguous and alarming statements about testing nuclear weapons, he has called for a comprehensive missile defense system called “Golden Dome” intended to “defend against all types of missiles from any adversary,” something Grego describes as “fantastical.” Others find the idea ill-defined and flawed. Anticipated costs for the system quickly surpassed $500 billion with some estimates in the trillions of dollars.

“This massive investment in strategic missile defense is really unhelpful,” Grego told Truthout. “It's not just wasted money,” she said. In the long run it “probably makes the world less safe.” The Nobel Declaration calls on China, Russia, and the United States to “acknowledge the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms and forgo massive investments in strategic missile defense.”

Breaking through to policy decision-making circles, Grego said, can be difficult as they are often sequestered in the Pentagon and may not be elected officials responsive to voters. Grego says members of Congress are rarely questioned by their own constituents on nuclear issues and that lack of public input is just fine with the powerful, highly organized corporate interests who stand to make a lot of money building expensive weapon systems.

Grego urges people to call their representative's office and to let them know if their votes don't correspond to your views. In particular, on rarely challenged issues like nuclear weapons, small, incremental steps can have a positive impact.

“While there's a lot of decision making that's held in the Pentagon,” Grego said, “the purse strings are held by Congress and that's still a powerful lever that we need to use better.”

According to a recent YouGov survey, 69 percent of Americans think nuclear weapons make the world a more dangerous place. Nearly half (49 percent) of respondents approve of reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal.

Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and one of the chief organizers of the Nobel nuclear assembly, told Truthout that whenever there's been a major reduction in nuclear threats, it followed years or decades of grassroots organizing and ongoing commitment, accompanied by public pressure with people saying, “we refuse to live in this world of increasing nuclear threats forever.” Major arms control achievements like the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 or the agreement by the U.S. and Soviet Union to reduce nuclear stockpiles in the 1980s didn't just happen. They were the result of sustained movements and public pressure.

“We've done this before. We figured out a way to reduce threats in the past and we kind of forgot,” said Bell. “We became complacent that we had dealt with this problem and we didn't have to spend as much time and effort on it.”

She recognized that people today have a long list of concerns — the economy, health care, crime, the precarious state of democracy — but she said, “[We]'ve got to make room for the nuclear threat as well because it's here whether or not you want to focus on it…and lack of attention is not going to make the problem better. In fact, it probably will make it worse and if we get the nuclear problem wrong, none of those other problems matter.”

She urged people to start talking about nuclear issues and ask their elected leaders how they are addressing the threat.

Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told Truthout “the risk [of nuclear war] is very, very low but obviously the consequence is impossible to imagine.” To that end, after the Nobel nuclear assembly, Lewis produced a short video that offers a vivid, terrifying snapshot of what a nuclear detonation would do to a city, in this case Chicago, the same city targeted in the movie A House of Dynamite.

He said the nuclear threat seems distant and gigantic, but, he added, “We know eventually our luck will run out.” He said, “We need to be gripped by some sense of urgency that we have made this deal with nuclear weapons to base our security on them and we know that deal is not going to work forever.” Given the enormity of a global nuclear catastrophe, Lewis said, “The fate of the world is everybody's problem, and everybody has a role to play.”

When considering the possibility of reducing the nuclear risk, Lewis said that Trump has demonstrated a visceral reaction to the destructiveness of nuclear weapons which he believes is quite sincere. “It's a shame because [Trump] has real political power,” said Lewis. “He has the political power to negotiate a verification protocol to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)” which, Lewis asserted, could make the Republican controlled Senate consent to ratifying the treaty which Lewis believes could earn Trump a Nobel Peace Prize. The United States is one of nine countries which have not ratified the CTBT, preventing it from entering into force.

Thomas Countryman, chairman of the board of the Arms Control Association and a 35-year veteran State Department diplomat, said the Nobel declaration would be significant if the public responded by demanding their elected leaders take steps to reduce nuclear danger. Those recommended steps could begin, he said, if there was a single leader among the nine nuclear weapons states who had the courage and moral conviction to prioritize nuclear risk reduction.

“I am somewhat encouraged that President Trump has said more than once that he is fearful of the effects of nuclear war. I think he appreciates how dangerous nuclear weapons are on a strong personal level,” Countryman said. “The problem is that neither he nor any of his counterparts in other nuclear weapon states have yet taken a meaningful step forward.” Although he has little confidence that Washington or Moscow will make significant progress on nuclear arms control in the next few years, Countryman says he has hope — “not confidence, but hope”— that China is in a unique position to do so.

Countryman will be watching the anticipated Trump-Xi summit in China next April closely. While he expects the meeting will focus on economic issues, it may be possible to address some nuclear matters too. He sees the opportunity for Trump and Xi to even take a very dramatic step of an announcement of a simultaneous ratification of the CTBT. “That may be too ambitious for both bureaucracies, but if both presidents have a little bit of courage and imagination, it could be done.” And while it could be possible, he fears there are “too many political and bureaucratic obstacles from any of the other nuclear armed states from moving forward on something dramatic.”

He conceded that conveying practical nuclear risk steps like those in the Nobel declaration is an uphill battle because, as he put it, in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing, “those who favor more nuclear weapons are in the ascendancy… all of them are feeling more confident and have the ear of their respective leaders much more frequently than those who are advocating for reduction of nuclear risk.”

Daniel Holz is a physics professor at the University of Chicago and chair of the science and security board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. As one of the chief organizers of the Nobel Assembly, he's been closely following progress of the declaration which has included calls by the Vatican to reduce and eliminate all nuclear weapons, ongoing and future follow up meetings around the world, and in October, a presentation and discussion at the Permanent Mission of Norway to the United Nations. Included in the discussion before the largely diplomatic audience was the call for all countries to increase investments and research on the environmental, economic, and other impacts of nuclear conflict by a newly formed UN Independent Scientific Panel on the Effects of Nuclear War, the first of its kind since the 1980s. Of the nine nuclear armed nations, only China voted to support the study.

That UN study, like the Nobel declaration and depictions of nuclear weapons in books, music, movies, and popular media, as well as concerns about nuclear testing, nuclear proliferation, and the collapse of arms control, underscores the urgent need for more public engagement.

An increasing public perception of nuclear risk, Holz said, “leads to discussion, it leads to awareness, and it does lead to pressure on leaders” which is necessary to effect change. “Once the public is aware and engaged, as it should be, because they will be impacted if this goes wrong … then policy makers start to pay attention.”

“Unfortunately, it's getting easier and easier to make the case that people should be aware.”

 America's Nuclear Warning Systems Aren't Ready for AI

 Erin D. Dumbacher

Since the dawn of the nuclear age, policymakers and strategists have tried to prevent a country from deploying nuclear weapons by mistake. But the potential for accidents remains as high as it was during the Cold War. In 1983, a Soviet early warning system erroneously indicated that a U.S. nuclear strike on the Soviet Union was underway; such a warning could have triggered a catastrophic Soviet counterattack. The fate was avoided only because the on-duty supervisor, Stanislav Petrov, determined that the alarm was false. Had he not, Soviet leadership would have had reason to fire the world's most destructive weapons at the United States.

The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence has exacerbated threats to nuclear stability. One fear is that a nuclear weapons state might delegate the decision to use nuclear weapons to machines. The United States, however, has introduced safeguards to ensure that humans continue to make the final call over whether to launch a strike. According to the 2022 National Defense Strategy, a human will remain “in the loop” for any decisions to use, or stop using, a nuclear weapon. And U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed in twin statements that “there should be human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.”

Yet AI poses another insidious risk to nuclear security. It makes it easier to create and spread deepfakes—convincingly altered videos, images, or audio that are used to generate false information about people or events. And these techniques are becoming ever more sophisticated. A few weeks after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a widely shared deepfake showed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling Ukrainians to set down their weapons; in 2023, a deepfake led people to falsely believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin interrupted state television to declare a full-scale mobilization. In a more extreme scenario, a deepfake could convince the leader of a nuclear weapons state that a first strike from an adversary was underway or an AI-supported intelligence platform could raise false alarms of a mobilization, or even a dirty bomb attack, by an adversary.

The Trump administration wants to harness AI for national security. In July, it released an action plan calling for AI to be used “aggressively” across the Department of Defense. In December, the department unveiled GenAI.mil, a platform with AI tools for employees. But as the administration embeds AI in national security infrastructure, it will be crucial for policymakers and systems designers to be careful about the role machines play in the early phases of nuclear decision-making. Until engineers can prevent problems inherent to AI, such as hallucinations and spoofing—in which large language models predict inaccurate patterns or facts—the U.S. government must ensure that humans continue to control nuclear early warning systems. Other nuclear weapons states should do the same.

Today, President Donald Trump uses a phone to access deepfakes; he sometimes reposts them on social media, as do many of his close advisers. As the lines become blurred between real and fake information, there is a growing possibility that such deepfakes could infect high-stakes national security decisions, including on nuclear weapons.

If misinformation can deceive the U.S. president for even a few minutes, it could spell disaster for the world. According to U.S. law, a president does not need to confer with anyone to order the use of nuclear weapons for either a retaliatory attack or a first strike. U.S. military officials stand at the ready to deploy the planes, submarines, and ground-based missiles that carry nuclear warheads. A U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile can reach its target within a half hour—and once such a missile is launched, no one can recall it.



Both U.S. and Russian nuclear forces are prepared to “launch on warning,” meaning that they can be deployed as soon as enemy missiles are detected heading their way. That leaves just minutes for a leader to evaluate whether an adversary's nuclear attack has begun. (Under current U.S. policy, the president has the option to delay a decision until after an adversary's nuclear weapon strikes the United States.) If the U.S. early warning system detects a threat to the United States, U.S. officials will try to verify the attack using both classified and unclassified sources. They might look at satellite data for activity at known military facilities, monitor recent statements from foreign leaders, and check social media and foreign news sources for context and on-the-ground accounts. Military officers, civil servants, and political appointees must then decide which information to communicate up the chain and how it is presented.

AI-driven misinformation could spur cascading crises. If AI systems are used to interpret early warning data, they could hallucinate an attack that isn't real—putting U.S. officials in a similar position to the one Petrov was in four decades ago. Because the internal logic of AI systems is opaque, humans are often left in the dark as to why AI came to a particular conclusion. Research shows that people with an average level of familiarity with AI tend to defer to machine outputs rather than checking for bias or false positives, even when it comes to national security. Without extensive training, tools, and operating processes that account for AI's weaknesses, advisers to White House decision-makers might default to assuming—or at least to entertaining—the possibility that AI-generated content is accurate.

Deepfakes that are transmitted on open-source media are nearly as dangerous. After watching a deepfake video, an American leader might, for example, misinterpret Russian missile tests as the beginning of offensive strikes or mistake Chinese live-fire exercises as an attack on U.S. allies. Deepfakes could help create pretexts for war, gin up public support for a conflict, or sow confusion.

In July, the Trump administration released an AI action plan that called for aggressive deployment of AI tools across the Department of Defense, the world's largest bureaucracy. AI has proved useful in making parts of the military more efficient. Machine learning makes it easier to schedule maintenance of navy destroyers. AI technology embedded in autonomous munitions, such as drones, can allow soldiers to stand back from the frontlines. And AI translation tools help intelligence officers parse data on foreign countries. AI could even be helpful in some other standard intelligence collection tasks, such as identifying distinctions between pictures of bombers parked in airfields from one day to the next.

Implementing AI across military systems does not need to be all or nothing. There are areas that should be off-limits for AI, including nuclear early warning systems and command and control, in which the risks of hallucination and spoofing outweigh the benefits that AI-powered software could bring. The best AI systems are built on cross-checked and comprehensive datasets. Nuclear early warning systems lack both because there have not been any nuclear attacks since the ones on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Any AI nuclear detection system would likely have to train on existing missile test and space tracking data plus synthetic data. Engineers would need to program defenses against hallucinations or inaccurate confidence assessments—significant technical hurdles.

It may be tempting to replace checks from highly trained staff with AI tools or to use AI to fuse various data sources to speed up analysis, but removing critical human eyes can lead to errors, bias, and misunderstandings. Just as the Department of Defense requires meaningful human control of autonomous drones, it should also require that each element of nuclear early warning and intelligence technology meet an even higher standard. AI data integration tools should not replace human operators who report on incoming ballistic missiles. Efforts to confirm early warning of a nuclear launch from satellite or radar data should remain only partially automated. And participants in critical national security conference calls should consider only verified and unaltered data.

In July 2025, the Department of Defense requested funds from Congress to add novel technologies to nuclear command, control, and communications. The U.S. government would be best served by limiting AI and automation integration to cybersecurity, business processes and analytics, and simple tasks, such as ensuring backup power turns on when needed.

Today, the danger of nuclear war is greater than it has been in decades. Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, China is rapidly expanding its arsenal, North Korea now has the ability to send ICBMs to the United States, and policies preventing proliferation are wavering. Against this backdrop, it is even more important to ensure that humans, not machines trained on poor or incomplete data, are judging the actions, intent, and aims of an adversary.

Intelligence agencies need to get better at tracking the provenance of AI-derived information and standardize how they relay to policymakers when data is augmented or synthetic. For example, when the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency uses AI to generate intelligence, it adds a disclosure to the report if the content is machine-generated. Intelligence analysts, policymakers, and their staffs should be trained to bring additional skepticism and fact-checking to content that is not immediately verifiable, just as many businesses are now vigilant against cyber spear phishing. And intelligence agencies need the trust of policymakers, who might be more inclined to believe what their own eyes and devices tell them—true or false—than what an intelligence assessment renders.

Experts and technologists should keep working to find ways to label and slow fraudulent information, images, and videos flowing through social media, which can influence policymakers. But given the difficulty of policing open-source information, it is all the more important for classified information to be accurate.



The Trump administration's updates to U.S. nuclear posture in the National Defense Strategy ought to guard against the likely and unwieldy AI information risks to nuclear weapons by reaffirming that a machine will never make a nuclear launch decision without human control. As a first step, all nuclear weapons states should agree that only humans will make nuclear use decisions. Then they should improve channels for crisis communications. A hotline for dialogue exists between Washington and Moscow but not between Washington and Beijing.

U.S. nuclear policy and posture have changed little since the 1980s, when leaders worried the Soviet Union would attack out of the blue. Policymakers then could not have wrapped their heads around how much misinformation would be delivered to the personal devices of the people in charge of nuclear weapons today. Both the legislative and executive branches should reevaluate nuclear weapons posture policies built for the Cold War. Policymakers might, for example, require future presidents to confer with congressional leaders before they launch a nuclear first strike or require a period of time for intelligence professionals to validate the information on which the decision is being based. Because the United States has capable second-strike options, accuracy should take precedence over speed.

AI already has the potential to deceive key decision-makers and members of the nuclear chain of command into seeing an attack that isn't there. In the past, only authentic dialogue and diplomacy averted misunderstandings among nuclear armed states. Policies and practices should protect against the pernicious information risks that could ultimately lead to doomsday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Luxury goods were once built to last. Now, some fall apart as easily as fast fashion","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/29/style/luxury-fashion-quality-issue","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 07:49:37 GMT","


            When New York-based model and influencer Wisdom Kaye went shopping at the Italian fashion label Miu Miu and returned home with a haul of clothes he says he spent $18,000 on, he didn't expect some of the items would fall apart in front of his eyes.
    


            In now-viral videos posted to his TikTok account, where he counts over 13 million followers, Kaye can be seen unveiling his purchases from the brand. In the first clip, posted to the social media platform in early September, he calls himself a “big Miu Miu fan” before launching into a scathing blow-by-blow of how some of his new purchases fell apart as he was unpacking them, saying: “As soon as I get home, everything broke.”
    


            Among the garments he had purchased that day, one of the gold buttons on a denim vest jacket “came off the instant I opened it,” he said on the video, demonstrating how he had unbuttoned the sleeveless garment. “I just opened it normally,” said Kaye.
    


            He then held up a brown sweater, also by Miu Miu, with a visibly broken silver zip. Kaye said he had “never gone and gotten multiple pieces from a place and things are just breaking as soon as I get home. This is genuinely f**king abysmal.”
    


            Three days later, Kaye popped up on TikTok feeds again. Miu Miu had offered him the choice of a refund or replacement of the broken items, he explained in the new video, noting that he chose the latter and wanted to unveil the new garments to his fans. However, as he began to undo the buttons of his vest, a button fell off once again. His mouth was wide in disbelief before exclaiming: “There's no way! This is unbelievable.”
    


            Kaye is not the only one taking their concerns to social media. In October, US-based dental hygienist Tiffany Kim shared a video on Instagram of a gray fleece jacket by Miu Miu and indicated that a drawstring had popped out of one of its sleeves. Some onlookers might immediately assume that it was natural wear-and-tear, but Kim said that she had only purchased it a month prior. While Miu Miu offers a repair service for its products, some store locations require customers to pay a fee. “It's not even about the fee. I can pay the fee,” said Kim. “I don't want to pay the fee because I literally paid $2,000 for this jacket and I only wore it twice.”
    


            Elsewhere, on X, a video posted by Elena Qiu in November shows the Seattle-based designer attempting to squeeze various objects into the heel of her leather split-toe tabi boots, to demonstrate its surprisingly hollow interior. The shoe, by Maison Margiela, is one of the French avant-garde label's most recognizable styles. In the caption, Qiu said she had purchased the shoes for $1,000 and expressed disappointment that the heel wasn't made of “stacked leather” but “hollow with plastic.”
    


            “I felt so sad and disappointed when the shoe cap came off,” Qiu later told CNN over email. “As a fashion designer myself, I understand how laborious artisanal craft is, and I don't expect fashion to stay pristine after excessive wear, but these shoes were not worn excessively. I had worn them less than once a month, mostly for special occasions.” Asked what she ended up doing with the shoes, Qiu said she took them to a cobbler to get the heel cap replaced, but has since become more cautious about wearing them regularly and creating further damage — “which defeats the purpose of why I bought them in the first place,” she said.
    


            These widely circulated videos have since sparked outrage among social media users, with some questioning the value of high-end goods, especially as prices have been rising exponentially over time. Others criticized the luxury industry for what they see as focusing too heavily on branding and trends, and not enough on durability. “As fashion consumers we need to put our foot down and stop buying Miu Miu until they learn how to produce clothing that doesn't fall apart,” wrote Odunayo Ojo, the content creator better known as Fashion Roadman, as he reshared Kim's video. “Because it's expensive doesn't make it luxury if the quality is not there!” commented another user in response.
    


            Asked whether the Prada Group, which owns Miu Miu, is aware of these videos, and what it is doing to prevent future issues with product quality, the company told CNN that “These were two isolated incidents and they are not indicative of quality issues for the brand. We handled the two cases via client service, with care, as we normally do with all our clients.” The group added that “Miu Miu's global post-purchase return rate ranges between 0.2% and 0.3%, making it one of the lowest in the luxury market.”
    


            Maison Margiela did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            The recent incidents may coincide with a broader issue in luxury fashion, where some experts believe high prices no longer guarantee a certain level of craftsmanship. They have also prompted some comparisons with high street and fast fashion brands, which are often associated with trend-driven pieces that are not always built to last. Dana Thomas, an author and veteran journalist, who spent over three decades covering the luxury fashion sector for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, noted similar quality issues with luxury brands back in the 2000s when her book “Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster” was published, suggesting a longstanding problem in the sector.
    


Luxury brands are more expensive than ever. They're telling you why they're worth it



            Speaking on the phone from her Paris apartment, Thomas recalled past trips to Milan that would result in a shopping spree at well-known luxury Italian brands. “For my meager budget of 1,000 euros (about $1,176) I could get some pants, a couple of sweaters, a pair of shoes, maybe even a handbag. It went a long way.” But then, she noticed, “One season to the next, the quality was dropping. What used to be a knitted one-piece were now pieces sewn together. The buttons fell off easily. The color was washing out.”
    


            Thomas continued: “I thought, what's going on here? Prices were going up pretty regularly. As a reporter, I was writing stories about how these companies were booming.” She saw sales growing minimally for brands, yet their profits were significant. “I'm terrible at math but there was an extreme difference between the two. Meanwhile, as a consumer, I could see that the quality was going down,” she said. Her suspicions that some brands were “totally focused on the bottom line” and that “they were switching their focus from beautiful products to beautiful profits” thus became the impetus for her book.
    


            Volkan Yilmaz, a leather specialist operating under the online pseudonym Tanner Leatherstein, shares a similar view. Based in Dallas, Texas, Yilmaz has amassed 1.3 million followers on TikTok, over 780,000 on Instagram and another half a million on YouTube for ripping apart and deconstructing bags and other leather goods from luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton and Chanel, with the view to answer a simple question: “Is it worth it?”
    


            On a video call, he acknowledged that the rise of social media platforms has made it easier for customers to share their opinions, and therefore, videos expressing disappointment with luxury purchases may seem much more frequent than in years' past, but he believes that there has also genuinely been a shift towards lesser quality products.
    


            Yilmaz didn't name specific high-end brands but said that on dissecting bags that had recently been produced, he felt that older styles – and the techniques used to make them – were comparatively “more sophisticated,” the materials “more artisanal.” However, “they are harder to do and are not that quick to make in large quantities,” he said — which may not align with the needs of big companies, several of which have resorted to mass production-like methods to keep up with high consumer demand.
    


            While some production still happens in traditional luxury hubs like Italy, the final assembly or component creation of a product often occurs elsewhere, as many high-end brands outsource manufacturing to third-party factories in low-cost regions.
    


            In 2024 and 2025, a series of investigations by Italian prosecutors exposed systemic labor exploitation within the supply chains of several luxury brands. These probes revealed that brands frequently outsourced production to a network of subcontractors — many Chinese-owned — who utilized undocumented labor in sweatshop-like conditions to maximize profit margins. Yilmaz added that the luxury sector's exorbitant price hikes — as brands seek to navigate a global market slowdown and rising production costs — has only exacerbated the problem. He caveated: “This is not to say that everything being made is garbage, but unfortunately, increasing prices doesn't mean an increase in quality.”
    


            For Thomas, the cost-cutting is apparent. “I remember when brands stopped lining pants. And they were doing that because they were cutting costs and lining costs money.”
    


            She pointed to garments with raw edges as another example, recounting a conversation with Alber Elbaz, the late designer who revitalized the French house Lanvin and founded the AZ Factory label, which he ran with the Swiss luxury conglomerate Richemont for just over three years until its closure in May 2024. “He told me that it's cheaper to just cut a hem and leave it raw, than to fold it and press it over and over again,” she said. You're taking four or five steps out of the process. So, it wasn't just a style trend, but an economic one.”
    


            In some cases, high-end brands also share the same manufacturing facilities as those on the high street. On writing “Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster,” Thomas recounted visiting a factory “with the same workers, on the same assembly line” making bags for both luxury and mall brands. “But those bags probably cost $10 or $12 and were being sold by mall brands for $100, while the luxury brand was selling it for $1,200.” The primary difference, she noted, was the materials being used.
    


            But now, even luxury brands are seeking to reduce costs when it comes to materials. “The finishes that are being used are more commercial,” said Diana Kakkar, the co-founder of MAES London, a premium garment supplier. “Brands get away with saying something is a wool jacket, but it's actually 30% wool and 70% polyester or acrylic.”
    


            In the case of Maison Margiela, the brand is not alone in using plastic inside its shoe heels — this has become widespread industry practice, according to Caroline Groves, a UK-based bespoke shoemaker. “Most traditional shoes are made of heavy leather, which is cut and layered on top of one another. From the 17th century onwards, people began using wood inside a heel and then fold leather or silk over it,” she said on a call from her workshop in the Cotswolds, England. “Plastic overtook wood at some stage, because people could just churn out hundreds and thousands at a time, very cheaply.” However, she noted that “it is legitimate and gives a strong interior to a heel that is then covered.”
    


            Kakkar said that throughout 2025 she has had several conversations with brands about cost-saving, including a reduction in fabric quality. “They'll come to us saying, for example, ‘We want to sell this camisole for £250 (about $335) and we ideally want silk.' But the cost of 100% silk with beautiful finishing can be quite staggering, because it is almost £50-£60 a meter now, if not more. So, they'll ask if we can do viscose, which is like, maybe, £25. It can be even cheaper, £10, depending on the various qualities. And then, even if those margins are not hitting them, we start looking at viscose polyester blend.
    


            “You can see how this slippery slope starts,” she said. “If there's a cheaper option, people will probably go for the cheaper option.”
    


            For Yilmaz, the cycle of constant, often frantic, creation and consumption across the luxury sector (in the form of new collections, endless content and bigger sales) marks a shift away from historical practices of scarcity and craftmanship. He takes a cynical view, noting that a growing number of luxury products “fall apart quicker… because you need people to keep consuming. Every quarter, these corporations need to report better sales. How is that going to happen if everything lasts forever?”
    


            It's in part why the French luxury goods maker Hermès is often cited as a preeminent example of luxury and consistently ranks as one of the most exclusive brands in the world. Earlier this year, it even overtook LVMH as the world's most valuable luxury company for the first time (however, the stock has since stabilized and LVMH reclaimed its top spot in late 2025).
    


            When Hermès listed on the stock market in 1993, the founding family maintained a substantial majority ownership, listing only a small proportion of shares. “It's sort-of to keep them responsible and make them answer to shareholders, but they still maintain control of the company. They answer to themselves first,” said Thomas. Subsequently, the company was able to emphasize craftsmanship and scarcity, and stick to a highly selective business model that has remained largely unchanged for nearly two centuries.
    


            Companies that are 100% publicly traded, for Thomas, “feel like an oxymoron.” She explained: “If your entire raison d'etre is to bring profits to shareholders, you are no longer in the business of making luxury; you're just in the business of making money.”
    


            Others agree that the industry needs to be recalibrated. When John Galliano, the former creative director of Maison Margiela, contacted Groves in 2023 to collaborate on footwear that would be shown at the brand's haute couture show in Paris a year later, it ended in “a sad but mutual acknowledgement that we could not reconcile the two worlds of fashion and craft,” Groves recalled. “He would require around 70 pairs made within a very short time frame (6-8 weeks at most). My annual production is around 40 pairs.”
    


            Groves, who has been in business for 40 years, shared that there have been several occasions in which she considered developing footwear for retail. “But each time I've gone down that route, I've realized that I can't be true to myself as a craftsman, because the price point of getting it to market means that the practices and the materials used in the factory are just not going to be what I want to put my name to,” she said. But not all brand founders share this sentiment, and Groves fears that shoppers “who can afford luxury are getting further and further away from the real deal and are therefore losing appreciation of what that really is.”
    


            However, increasing scrutiny — and in some cases, distrust — of luxury brands has also created new opportunities. According to McKinsey & Company's 2026 “State of Fashion” report with the Business of Fashion, the mid-market is “the fastest growing segment,” and through attractive price points that correspond with high product quality and elevated store experiences, brands in that range are “replacing luxury as fashion's main value creator.” (Indeed, see the success of contemporary labels like Polene, Toteme or Studio Nicholson.)
    


            The online backlash, Yilmaz believes, serves as “a wake-up call” for the industry. “You can only say so much to convince people that luxury is high quality. If your products are falling apart in front of them, then it's not believable, no matter how much you spend on marketing,” he said. “So many new brands are entering the space to address this issue, and their products don't cost thousands of dollars. I think, in the end, it's a great time to be a customer. The quality has to start delivering again,” he noted – otherwise, why shop at all?

            The man accused of placing two pipe bombs in Washington, DC, on the eve of the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol told investigators after his arrest that he believed someone needed to “speak up” for people who believed the 2020 election was stolen and that he wanted to target the country's political parties because they were “in charge,” prosecutors said Sunday.
    


            The allegations were laid out in a Justice Department memo arguing that Brian J. Cole Jr., who was arrested earlier this month on charges of placing pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees, should remain locked up while the case moves forward.
    


            The memo provides the most detailed government account of statements Cole is alleged to have made to investigators and points to evidence, including bomb-making components found at his home after his arrest, that officials say connects him to the act. The homemade bombs did not detonate and were discovered January 6, the afternoon that rioters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an effort to halt the certification of his election loss to Joe Biden.
    


            Cole, 30, denied to investigators that his actions were connected to Congress or the events of January 6, the memo says. But after initially disputing that he had any involvement in the pipe bombs, prosecutors say, he confessed to placing them outside the RNC and DNC. He acknowledged feeling disillusioned by the 2020 election, fed up with both political parties, and sympathetic to claims by Trump and some of his allies that the contest had been stolen.
    


            According to the memo, he told agents who interviewed him that if people “feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being — you know, relegated null and void, then, like, someone needs to speak up, right? Someone up top. You know, just to, just to at the very least calm things down.”
    


            He said “something just snapped” after “watching everything, just everything getting worse” and that he wanted to do something “to the parties” because “they were in charge,” according to the Justice Department's memo. Prosecutors say when Cole was asked why he had placed the explosives at the RNC and DNC, he responded, “I really don't like either party at this point.”
    


            Cole was arrested on the morning of December 4 at his Woodbridge, Virginia, house in what law enforcement officials described as a major breakthrough in their nearly five-year investigation.
    


            During a search of Cole's home and car after his arrest, prosecutors say, investigators found shopping bags of bomb-making components. He at first denied having manufactured or placed the pipe bombs, prosecutors say, and when pressed about his whereabouts on the evening of January 5, 2021, initially told investigators he had driven by himself to attend a protest related to the 2020 election.
    


            “I didn't agree with what people were doing, like just telling half the country that they — that their — that they just need to ignore it. I didn't think that was a good idea, so I went to the protest,” the memo quotes him as saying.
    


            But over the course of hours of questioning, prosecutors say, Cole acknowledged he went to Washington not for a protest but rather to place the bombs. He stowed the explosives in a shoebox in the back seat of his Nissan Sentra and placed one apiece outside the RNC and DNC headquarters, setting the timer on each for 60 minutes, the memo says.
    


            Neither device exploded, a fact Cole says he was “pretty relieved” about; he planted them at night because he did not want to kill anyone, the memo says.
    


            The fact that the devices did not detonate is due to luck, “not lack of effort,” prosecutors said in arguing that Cole poses a danger to the community and must remain detained pending trial.
    


            “The defendant's choice of targets risked the lives not only of innocent pedestrians and office workers but also of law enforcement, first responders, and national political leaders who were inside of the respective party headquarters or drove by them on January 6, 2021, including the Vice President-elect and Speaker of the House,” prosecutors wrote.
    


            Cole's lawyers will have an opportunity to state their position on detention ahead of a hearing set for Tuesday in Washington's federal court.

HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”

Taiwan's aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.

The drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan's prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.

China's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support. 

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party's targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.

Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.

Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.




Shi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.”

“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.

China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland's government claims it as sovereign territory.

China's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait. 

Hsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone” — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.

“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.

Military drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.

The Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.

Commercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.

The Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,” adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.

Last week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.

Under U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter's administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.

Asked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted “to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”

“External forces' attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said. 

There was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.

Karen Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.

“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.

 In October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.

The military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,” during a trip to Shanghai.

Zohran Mamdani has promised to transform New York City government when he becomes mayor. Can he do it?

Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, already faces intense scrutiny, even before taking office in one of the country's most scrutinized political jobs. Republicans have cast him as a liberal boogeyman. Some of his fellow Democrats have deemed him too far left. Progressives are closely watching for any signs of him shifting toward the center. 

On Jan. 1, he will assume control of America's biggest city under that harsh spotlight, with the country watching to see if he can pull off the big promises that vaulted him to office and handle the everyday duties of the job. All while skeptics call out his every stumble.

For Mamdani, starting off strong is key, said George Arzt, a veteran Democratic political consultant in New York who worked for former Mayor Ed Koch.

“He's got to use the first 100 days of the administration to show people he can govern,” he said. “You've got to set a mindset for people that's like, ‘Hey, this guy's serious.'”

That push should begin with Mamdani's first speech as mayor, where Arzt said it will be important for the city's new leader to establish a clear blueprint of his agenda and tell New Yorkers what he plans to do and how he plans to do it. 

Mamdani will be sworn-in around midnight during a private ceremony at a historic, out-of-use City Hall subway station. Then in the afternoon, he will be sworn-in a second time on the steps of City Hall, while his supporters are expected to crowd surrounding streets for an accompanying block party. 

From there, Arzt said Mamdani will have to count on the seasoned hands he's hired to help him handle the concrete responsibilities of the job, while he and his team also pursue his ambitious affordability agenda. 

Mamdani campaigned on a big idea: shifting the power of government toward helping working class New Yorkers, rather than the wealthy.

His platform — which includes free child care, free city bus service and a rent freeze for people living in rent stabilized apartments — excited voters in one of America's most expensive cities and made him a leading face of a Democratic Party searching for bright, new leaders during President Donald Trump's second term.

But Mamdani may find himself contending with the relentless responsibilities of running New York City. That includes making sure the trash is getting picked up, potholes are filled and snow plows go out on time. When there's a subway delay or flooding, or a high-profile crime or a police officer parks in a bicycle lane, it's not unusual for the city's mayor to catch some heat. 

“He had a movement candidacy and that immediately raises expectations locally and nationally,” said Basil Smikle, a Democratic political strategist and Columbia University professor, who added that it might be good for Mamdani to “Just focus on managing expectations and get a couple of good wins under your belt early on.”

“There's a lot to keep you busy here,” he said.

A large part of Mamdani's job will also be to sell his politics to the New Yorkers who remain skeptical of him, with Smikle saying “the biggest hurdle” is getting people comfortable with his policies and explaining how what he's pushing could help the city.

“It's difficult to have this all happen on day one,” he said, “or even day 30 or even day 100.”

Mamdani's universal free child care proposal — perhaps one of his more expensive plans — is also one that has attracted some of the strongest support from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate from Buffalo who endorsed the mayor-elect.

Hochul is eager to work with Mamdani on the policy and both leaders consider the program a top priority, although it's not yet clear how exactly the plan could come to fruition. The governor, who is up for reelection next year, has repeatedly said she does not want to raise income taxes — something Mamdani supports for wealthy New Yorkers — however she has appeared open to raising corporate taxes. 

“I think he has allies and supporters for his agenda, but the question is how far will the governor go,” said state Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, a Mamdani ally. 

“There's an acknowledgement that the voters have spoken, and there's very clear policies that were associated with his successful campaign,” he said, “so to not make progress on them would be us thumbing our noses at the voters.”

Mamdani's pledge to freeze the rent for roughly 1 million rent stabilized apartments in the city would not require state cooperation. 

But that proposal — perhaps the best known of his campaign — is already facing headwinds, after the city's departing mayor, Eric Adams, made a series of appointments in recent weeks to a local board that determines annual rent increases for the city's rent stabilized units.

The move could potentially complicate the mayor-elect's ability to follow through on the plan, at least in his first year, although Mamdani has said he remains confident in his ability to enact the freeze.

His relationship with some of the city's Jewish community remains in tatters over his criticisms of Israel's government and support for Palestinian human rights. 

The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish advocacy organization, plans to track Mamdani's policies and hires as it pledged to “protect Jewish residents across the five boroughs during a period of unprecedented antisemitism in New York City.” 

Earlier this month, a Mamdani appointee resigned over social media posts she made more than a decade ago that featured antisemitic tropes, after the Anti-Defamation League shared the posts online. 

The group has since put out additional findings on others who are serving in committees that Mamdani set up as he transitions into his mayoral role. In response, Mamdani said the ADL often “ignores the distinction” between antisemitism and criticism of the Israeli government.

The mayor-elect's past call to defund the city's police department continue to be a vulnerability. His decision to retain Jessica Tisch, the city's current police commissioner, has eased some concerns about a radical shakeup at the top of the nation's largest police force. 

And then there's Trump.

Tensions between Trump and Mamdani have appeared to cool — for now — after months of rancor led into a surprisingly friendly Oval Office meeting. Future clashes may emerge given the sharp political differences between them, particularly on immigration enforcement, along with anything else that could set off the mercurial president.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AP) — Officials said a train accident in southern Mexico killed at least 13 people and injured dozens, halting traffic along a rail line connecting the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico.

The Interoceanic Train linking the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz went off the rails Sunday as it passed a curve near the town of Nizanda. 

“The Mexican Navy has informed me that, tragically, 13 people died in the Interoceanic Train accident,” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum posted on X, adding that 98 people are injured, five of them seriously.

She said she instructed the secretary of the navy and the undersecretary of human rights of the Ministry of the Interior to travel to the site and personally assist the families.

In a message on X Sunday, Oaxaca state Gov. Salomon Jara said several government agencies had reached the site of the accident to assist the injured.

Officials said that 241 passengers and nine crew members were on the train when the accident occurred.

The Interoceanic Train was inaugurated in 2023 by then President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The rail service is part of a broader push to boost train travel in southern Mexico, and develop infrastructure along the isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

The Mexican government plans to turn the isthmus into a strategic corridor for international trade, with ports and rail lines that can connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Interoceanic train currently runs from the port of Salina Cruz on the Pacific Ocean to Coatzacoalcos, covering a distance of approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) .

US President Donald Trump on Sunday insisted Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace deal as he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort, but he acknowledged the negotiations are complex and could still break down, leaving the war dragging on for years.

President Donald Trump said Sunday he believes both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin truly want peace, as he welcomed the “brave” Ukrainian leader for talks at his Florida resort.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday insisted Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace deal as he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort, but he acknowledged the negotiations are complex and could still break down, leaving the war dragging on for years.

The president's statements came after the leaders met for talks following what Trump said was an “excellent,” two-and-a-half-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine launched the war nearly four years ago. Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations.

“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said during a late afternoon news conference as he stood with Zelenskyy after their meeting. He repeatedly praised his counterpart as “brave.”

Trump and Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure it's not invaded again in the future. After their discussion, they called a wide group of European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland.

Zelenskyy said Trump had agreed to host European leaders again, possibly at the White House, sometime in January. Trump said the meeting could be in Washington or “someplace.”

Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his work. “Ukraine is ready for peace,” he said.

Trump said he'd follow the meeting with another call to Putin. Earlier Sunday, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side and was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike.” Ushakov said Trump and Putin agreed to speak again “promptly” after Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.

But Ushakov added that a “bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv” on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a “complete cessation” of hostilities.

Both leaders identified deciding the future of the Donbas region as a major sticking point. 

Trump said the parties were inching closer to agreement. “That's a very tough issue but one that I think will get resolved,” he said.

Zelenskyy said: “Our attitude is very clear. That's why President Trump said this is a very tough question and, of course, we have with Russia different positions on it.”

Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is “very serious” about ending the war, even as Russia continued striking targets in Ukraine as Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. Trump said, “I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also.” 

He held out the possibility that negotiations could still fall apart.

“In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think,” Trump said. “We could have something where one item that you're not thinking about is a big item, breaks it up. Look, it's been a very difficult negotiation. Very detailed.” 

Trump and Zelenskyy's sit-down underscored the apparent progress made by Trump's top negotiators in recent weeks as the sides traded draft peace plans to end the fighting. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is “about 90% ready” — echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Trump's chief negotiators met with Zelenskyy in Berlin this month.

During the recent talks, the U.S. agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO. The proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country's bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks. 

Zelenskyy also spoke on Christmas Day with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The Ukrainian leader said they discussed “certain substantive details” and cautioned “there is still work to be done on sensitive issues” and “the weeks ahead may also be intensive.”

The U.S. president has been working to end the war in Ukraine for much of his first year back in office, showing irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of ending the conflict. Gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day. Indeed, on Sunday, Trump referred multiple times to the complexity of the negotiations.

After hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and “stop at the battle line,” implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine. 

Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.

Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured. Kyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.

The Kremlin also wants Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO. It warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance and would view them as a “legitimate target.”

Putin also has said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language, demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.

Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk -– one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region — even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.

Ushakov cautioned that trying to reach a compromise could take a long time. He said U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been “worsened” by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.

Trump has been somewhat receptive to Putin's demands, arguing that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.

LATAKIA, Syria (AP) — Clashes broke out on Syria's coast between protesters from the Alawite religious minority and counterdemonstrators Sunday, killing at least four people and injuring dozens of others, health officials said.

The clashes came two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers. Thousands of protesters gathered in the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, and elsewhere. 

Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven't publicly identified a suspect in Friday's bombing. Funerals for the dead were held Saturday.

A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates.

Sunday's demonstrations were called for by Ghazal Ghazal, an Alawite sheikh living outside of Syria who heads a group called the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council in Syria and the Diaspora.

An Associated Press photographer in Latakia saw pro-government counterprotesters throw rocks at the Alawite demonstrators, while a group of protesters beat a counterdemonstrator who crossed to their side. Security forces tried to break up the two sides and fired into the air in an attempt to disperse them. 




Syria's state-run television reported that two members of the security forces were wounded in the area of Tartous after someone threw a hand grenade at a police station, and cars belonging to security forces were set on fire in Latakia.

Later, state-run news agency SANA reported that a member of the security forces was killed by gunfire. 

The AP photographer in Latakia saw the bodies of four people killed in the clashes in local hospitals. Three of them had head wounds that appeared consistent with being hit by rocks, while one had a bullet wound in the chest.

The state-run SANA news agency said 60 people were wounded by “stabbings, blows from stones, and gunfire targeting both security personnel and civilians.”

The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December 2024 that brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad, an Alawite, fled the country to Russia.

In March, an ambush carried out by Assad's supporters against security forces triggered days of violence that left hundreds of people dead, most of them Alawites. Since then, although the situation has calmed, Alawites have been targeted sporadically in sectarian attacks. They have also complained of discrimination against them in public employment since Assad's fall and of young Alawite men detained without charges.

During the rein of the Assad dynasty, Alawites were overrepresented in government jobs and in the army and security forces.

Government officials condemned Friday's attack and promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but haven't yet announced any arrests.

“We went out to protest the incidents of killing and the marginalization and arrests and detentions and the employees who were fired,” said Hussein Abbas, an engineer who joined the Alawite protest.

Counterprotester Mohammed Ismail from Latakia blamed spoilers who benefited from the former system under Assad for sowing discord.

“We are calling for one Syria and one people, and they don't want that,” he said. “They want to return us to chaos so they can benefit.”

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins 'Fox News Live' reacting to China and Russia's public condemnation of U.S. military pressure against Venezuela as oil tanker blockades continue to impact their economies.

China on Monday launched its largest military exercises ever around Taiwan, surrounding the island with warships, aircraft and live-fire drills as tensions spiked following a record U.S. arms sale to Taipei.

The drills, known as ""Justice Mission 2025,"" involve coordinated deployments of ground forces, naval vessels, fighter jets, drones and artillery across seven maritime zones encircling Taiwan.

China's Eastern Theater Command said the exercises include simulated strikes on land and sea targets and rehearsals to blockade Taiwan's main ports, a scenario analysts say would be central to any attempt to isolate or coerce the island.

Live-fire exercises are scheduled to continue through Tuesday, with China designating large danger zones for artillery firing closer to Taiwan than in any previous round of drills. The scope of the operation has already disrupted civilian air and sea traffic, forcing airlines to reroute flights and Taiwan's aviation authority to plan alternative airspace corridors.

Chinese military officials defended the exercises as a response to separatism and foreign involvement. ""It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity,"" Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said.

The military escalation comes less than two weeks after the U.S. approved an $11.1 billion weapons package for Taiwan, the largest such sale ever. Beijing denounced the deal, warning it risks turning Taiwan into a ""powder keg"" and driving the region toward ""military confrontation and war.""

CHINA WARNS OF RISING WAR RISK AFTER HISTORIC US ARMS SALE TO TAIWAN

The package includes 82 HIMARS rocket launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, giving Taiwan a new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait. It also includes 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced unmanned aerial vehicle systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons.

""The ‘Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.

""This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.""

TAIWAN GENERAL WARNS CHINA'S MILITARY DRILLS COULD BE PREPARATION FOR BLOCKADE OR WAR, VOWS TO RESIST

As the drills unfolded, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said 89 Chinese military aircraft, 14 naval vessels and 14 coast guard ships were operating around the island, with additional warships spotted farther out in the Western Pacific. Some Chinese vessels were engaged in close stand-offs with Taiwanese ships near the island's contiguous zone, about 24 nautical miles from shore.

""Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait … would not only constitute military pressure on us, but could also pose more complex challenges and impacts for the international community and neighboring countries,"" Hsieh Jih-sheng, Taiwan's deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence, told reporters.

Taiwan placed its military on high alert and said it was prepared to conduct rapid response exercises if the drills escalated. The defense ministry released a video highlighting its own capabilities, including U.S.-made HIMARS systems, while the coast guard deployed large patrol ships to monitor Chinese vessels near its waters.

Chinese state media said the exercises focus on sealing off Taiwan's key deep-water ports, including Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, reinforcing concern that Beijing is refining blockade options short of an outright invasion.

China also released propaganda videos and posters alongside the drills, including footage depicting automated humanoid robots, swarms of micro-drones and weaponized robotic dogs attacking the island, as well as imagery appearing to show civilian vessels that analysts say could support an amphibious assault.

""I think these drills are just meant to scare us,"" said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher in Taipei. ""Similar drills have happened before … the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan's current government and how they choose to respond.""

China claims Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan rejects that claim, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing criticism after he welcomed home a recently released Egyptian prisoner who allegedly posted violent and antisemitic language on his social media in the past.

Successive British governments have pushed for the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a dual British Egyptian national who had been behind bars in Egypt for most of the last 14 years.

He was released from prison in September following a pardon by the Egyptian president, but remained in the country under a travel ban that was only recently lifted, allowing him to return to the U.K. on Friday.

Starmer celebrated Abd el-Fattah's return by saying he was ""delighted"" that the activist had been reunited with his family in Britain.

Meanwhile, a senior member of the opposition Conservative Party criticized Starmer for giving a ""personal, public endorsement"" to Abd el-Fattah.

Robert Jenrick, the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor, wanted to know whether Starmer was aware of past social media posts in which Abd el-Fattah allegedly endorsed killing Zionists and police. Jenrick also demanded that Starmer condemn Abd el-Fattah's remarks and withdraw his ""unalloyed endorsement"" of the activist.

""Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily nor for peaceful dissent,"" Jenrick wrote. ""But neither should the prime minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed.""

Jenrick, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have called for Abd el-Fattah's British citizenship to be revoked and for him to be deported.

The U.K. government later clarified that the prime minister did not know about the ""abhorrent"" social media posts when he issued the welcoming statement.

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement that it had been ""a long-standing priority"" of governments under both major parties to push for Abd el-Fattah's release, but it said that does not imply an endorsement of his social media posts.

""The government condemns Mr. El-Fattah's historic tweets and considers them to be abhorrent,"" the statement said.

Abd el-Fattah issued an ""unequivocal apology"" on Sunday, describing his past comments as the ""expressions of a young man's anger"" during regional crises and police brutality in Egypt.

Abd el-Fattah's family in the U.K. had argued that he spent most of the past 14 years behind bars because of his opposition to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's government.

His mother, Laila Soueif, 69, was on a 10-month hunger strike to pressure British authorities to do more to secure her son's freedom.

Shortly after Abd el-Fattah arrived at London's Heathrow Airport, critics began circulating his past social media posts. Abd el-Fattah has previously said the comments were taken out of context and were part of a ""private conversation"" that happened during an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip, according to The Times of London.

Fox News' CB Cotton and former assistant U.S. attorney for D.C. Cully Stimson join 'Fox News Live' to discuss the arrest of Brian Cole Jr., a ruling allowing the National Guard to remain in D.C. and the probe into the Minnesota fraud scandal.

Federal prosecutors said Sunday the man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, told investigators he felt compelled to ""speak up"" for people who believed the 2020 election was stolen and said he targeted the two major political parties because they were in charge of the political system.

Prosecutors detailed the allegations in a memo filed with the Justice Department, arguing that Brian J. Cole Jr., arrested earlier this month, should remain detained as the case moves forward.

Cole was arrested in Woodbridge, Virginia, after investigators identified him as the suspect accused of placing pipe bombs near the Capitol complex and outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters, marking the first major break in a case that had gone cold for years.

Sunday's memo provides the most detailed government account to date, including statements prosecutors say Cole made to investigators. It also cites evidence such as bomb-making materials recovered from his home after his arrest, which officials say link him to the crime.

EVIDENCE AGAINST J6 PIPE BOMB SUSPECT WAS JUST ‘SITTING THERE' FOR YEARS, DOJ SAYS

Undetonated homemade bombs were discovered Jan. 6, though prosecutors said Cole denied his actions were connected to the events at the Capitol that day.

Although he initially denied involvement, prosecutors allege Cole later confessed to placing the devices outside the RNC and DNC.

Cole also allegedly said he was disillusioned by the election outcome and sympathetic to claims by President Donald Trump and some allies that it had been stolen.

""In the defendant's view, if people ‘feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being – you know, relegated null and void, then, like, someone needs to speak up, right? Someone up top. You know, just to, just to at the very least calm things down,'"" prosecutors wrote.

They added that when agents returned to ask questions about his motive, Cole explained that ""something just snapped"" after ""watching everything, just everything getting worse.""

The suspect is seen walking outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters moments before placing one of two pipe bombs discovered near party offices in Washington, D.C. (FBI)

""The defendant wanted to do something ‘to the parties' because ‘they were in charge,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""When asked why he placed the devices at the RNC and DNC, the defendant responded, ‘I really don't like either party at this point.'""

Prosecutors said Cole also told investigators the idea to use pipe bombs stemmed from his interest in the historical conflict in Northern Ireland.

Cole's attorneys are expected to argue against his detention at a hearing scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.

The multi-state manhunt for the Brown and MIT shooting suspect is over after police found his body in a New Hampshire storage unit. Officials confirm a link between the suspect and the MIT professor he killed.

Across the country this year, fugitives on the run turned quiet neighborhoods, rural towns and college campuses into crime scenes. Five major manhunts, each chaotic in its own way, sent police scrambling, triggered lockdowns and highlighted how quickly suspects can disappear.

Ten inmates, including several accused of murder, escaped through a hole behind a toilet at Orleans Justice Center in the early morning hours of May 16, triggering a monthslong, multi-agency manhunt across Louisiana and beyond.

The inmates taunted authorities on their way out, leaving handwritten messages on the cell wall, including one that read, ""To easy LOL.""

Jail staff did not realize the inmates were missing until about 8:30 a.m., hours after the escape, officials later acknowledged during a City Council meeting.

The breakout exposed deep security failures inside the aging jail, from staffing shortages to long-ignored maintenance issues. An employee of the New Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office was charged with allegedly aiding the escape by turning off water in the cell, while two suspected accomplices were also arrested in connection with allegedly helping the inmates.

""First of all, that jail had been deemed a train wreck in terms of just basic jail operations,"" former federal prison Warden Cameron Lindsay previously told Fox News Digital.

""It would appear that basic security inspections were not taking place. Inmates should never be able to tear a toilet off a wall and go straight to the perimeter fence. I just can't believe that.""

By October, all 10 escapees had been captured, but the incident triggered intense scrutiny of jail oversight and leadership.

Former police chief and convicted killer Grant Hardin, 56, slipped out of the Calico Rock prison on May 25 by disguising himself as a corrections officer — a breach made possible when a guard mistook him for staff.

Nicknamed the ""Devil in the Ozarks,"" Hardin escaped through a sally port wearing a makeshift Arkansas Department of Correction-style uniform, prison officials said, noting it was not an official uniform.

The former police chief pleaded guilty to fatally shooting a man inside the victim's work truck in 2017. After submitting DNA samples when he was booked for the murder case, his DNA was linked to the 1997 cold-case rape of a teacher. He pleaded guilty in that case in 2019, according to KNWA.

""This guy is just so evil. I mean, this guy is a sociopath,"" survivalist Shawn Hendrix previously told Fox News Digital. ""[Hardin] has no care for humans or anybody but himself. He's law-enforcement trained. He has a history of issues in and out of the police. I think there's a whole bigger story of how this guy was a cop for 27 years, right? … I would not want to be out looking for this guy.""

The escape sparked a massive manhunt across the rugged Ozark terrain involving state police, the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI. Hardin was captured on June 6, nearly two weeks later, less than two miles from the prison.

""Thanks to the great work of local, state and federal law enforcement, Arkansans can breathe a sigh of relief and I can confirm that violent criminal Grant Hardin is back in custody,"" Gov. Sarah Sanders said following his capture. ""I am grateful for all law enforcement who contributed to his capture and give special thanks to the Trump administration and Secretary Kristi Noem, who sent a team from Border Patrol that was instrumental in tracking and apprehending Hardin.""

After murdering his three daughters, Travis Caleb Decker vanished into rural Washington state, setting off one of the largest manhunts Chelan County has ever seen.

Investigators began searching for Decker in late May after he failed to return his daughters, Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5, to their mother following a scheduled visitation. The children's bodies were later found near Rock Island Campground along Icicle Creek with bags over their heads. Autopsies determined the girls died from suffocation.

An Army veteran with extensive survival training, Decker managed to evade capture as teams from multiple counties and federal agencies combed vast stretches of wilderness.

His remains were eventually discovered in September, bringing the manhunt to a close. 

""To Whitney, we apologize it's taken this long to get the closure we were looking for in this case,"" Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison said in a news conference, referring to Decker's ex-wife and the mother of the three slain girls. ""But I hope you can rest easier at night knowing Travis is accounted for. He is deceased, our DNA results confirmed that and this will bring a close to our case."" 

A deadly mass shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda left four people dead on Aug. 1, prompting a weeklong, multi-agency manhunt through rugged terrain after the suspected gunman fled the scene.

Authorities identified 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. Army soldier, as the suspect in the fatal quadruple homicide and said he was tracked for days before being taken into custody about five-and-a-half miles from the crime scene, near a barn west of Anaconda.

During the search, officials warned Brown was armed and extremely dangerous as law enforcement expanded operations across steep, heavily wooded areas.

Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte praised the coordinated response of local, state and federal authorities at a news briefing, saying officers ""didn't waste a second"" in the effort to locate the suspect. Attorney General Austin Knudsen said approximately 130 personnel assisted in the manhunt and credited community tips with helping lead investigators to Brown.

The victims were identified as Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64; David Allen Leach, 70; and Tony Wayne Palm, 74, all residents of Anaconda.

Investigators said Brown initially fled the bar on foot and was later believed to be using a stolen vehicle, allowing him to evade capture for several days before his arrest.

Some residents told Fox News Digital they had previously described Brown as volatile, with individuals saying they warned neighbors he might ""snap"" before the shooting.

A deadly classroom attack inside Brown University's Barus and Holley engineering building killed two students and wounded nine others during a finals-week review session on Dec. 13, triggering a massive multi-agency manhunt.

The victims were identified as Ella Cook, a vice president of the College Republicans from Birmingham, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an aspiring neurosurgeon from Virginia.

Authorities later identified 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a Portuguese national, as the suspected gunman. He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, during the search. Investigators believe he was also responsible for the fatal shooting of an MIT professor days later.

The manhunt and its aftermath left campuses nationwide reexamining safety measures, as investigators worked to retrace Neves-Valente's movements using surveillance video, public tips and physical evidence.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced that he is surging federal agents and “investigative resources” to Minnesota as a fraud scandal mostly involving Somali immigrants continues to grip the state.

In a update on Sunday, Patel said the bureau's investigation will look to “dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs,” some of which have already been uncovered.

Patel pointed to numerous indictments and convictions handed down last month against individuals involved with Feeding Our Future, a Minnesota-based organization that stole $250 million worth of federal funds meant for vulnerable children during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Department of Justice, the money was not used for children's meals but instead to fund the organization's leaders' “lavish lifestyles.” Some funds were also reportedly funneled to the Somali-based al Shabaab terrorist group.

Patel said that scheme is “just the tip of a very large iceberg,” vowing to “continue to follow the money and protect children.”

“Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,” he added.

Other alleged fraud schemes have since been uncovered, including by independent journalist Nick Shirley.

In a video that has been widely shared, including by lawmakers, Shirley is repeatedly stonewalled by workers at multiple supposed Minnesota daycare centers, which reportedly have no enrolled children.

The reporting caught the eye of Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), who blasted Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) for allegedly turning a blind eye to the fraud.

“Tim Walz sat idly by while billions were stolen from hardworking Minnesotans. What Walz refused to address for SEVEN YEARS, Nick Shirley uncovered in ONE DAY. The fraud in Minnesota is so brazen and so vast that it's IMPOSSIBLE Walz's administration didn't know about it,” he posted on X over the weekend.

Walz has been pushing back on such accusations, saying he would instead “welcome more” Somali immigrants into Minnesota amid the fraud scandal. His office said on Sunday that Walz has “worked for years to crack down on fraud” and has since “strengthened oversight” of these organizations.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT WANTS ANSWERS ON MINNESOTA SOMALI FRAUD SCHEME

Scrutiny has also turned to another Minnesota Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), after reporting revealed her husband's venture capital firm, Rose Lake Capital, removed the names of its top officers amid questions about the couple's finances and the separate Minnesota fraud scandal. None of those officers were charged with fraud, and Omar, who is Somali American, has denied any personal connection to the separate scandal.

But questions have been raised about her most recent financial disclosure from May, which shows her net worth jumped a staggering 3500% from the previous year to some $30 million. Most of that valuation is tied up in Rose Lake Capital assets.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

There's a new line dividing young Americans.

Over the last year, the youngest generation of American voters have scrambled a lot of our understanding of politics.

The Gen Z cohort swung hard toward Republicans last year, moving anywhere from 6 to 21 points (depending on the data source) toward President Donald Trump compared to 2020. But they now appear to be just as aggressively swinging away. In recent polls, they prefer Democratic congressional control by 17 points in 2026 and, now, strongly disapprove of Trump — a flip from earlier this year.

This swerve back includes young men — that segment of the country that Democrats, and a lot of the media, spent the last two years fixated on understanding. After all, reports over the last few years suggested these young Americans were becoming more conservative. They were getting more religious, were more Trump-curious, and were rebelling against Democrats and popular culture for making traditional masculinity taboo — all while dealing with a mental health and loneliness crisis.

Could they have become bleeding heart liberals over the course of a few months? The answer may determine more than just the midterm elections. Different segments of Gen Z may have different reasons for feeling disillusioned with party politics and the state of the nation. And that may determine what the next generation of political leaders will have to say and propose to re-spark faith in the political system.

To analyze this question, I revisited one popular theory that I tried to articulate in the spring: There are two distinct kinds of Gen Z. One is an older cohort, generally born between 1995 and 2001 — more loyal to Democrats and familiar with a pre-pandemic way of life. The other is a younger one, born after 2002 — raised during and after the pandemic, more idiosyncratic politics, and seeming more friendly to Trump during the first half of the year and in 2024.

Now, new data continues to back up the case that there are nuances within Gen Z that carried over from 2024. And, more specifically, a new survey published last week from the Young Men's Research Project suggests that, at least among Gen Z men, it's the younger cohort that is turning sharply more anti-Trump than the older cohort. While it is one data set, it adds to the body of evidence that the youngest members of the electorate are going through a tumultuous period right now.

In October, the team behind the Young Men Research Project partnered with the polling group YouGov to zero in on men aged 18–29. What they found challenges some of the theory that I laid out earlier this year, namely that the younger cohort of Gen Z is more likely to identify as “conservative” and hold traditional views of politics and society, specifically gender, than the older cohort. But, it also provides evidence that the opinions and views of these two cohorts of young people are shifting around at different rates.

First, there's some of the expected. As in their last survey in May, they found a generation of anxious and pessimistic young men. While most of the older cohort of Gen Z men thought the country was on the wrong track, those levels were even higher among the younger cohort.

This gap in cynicism also came up again in approval ratings of Donald Trump (though both cohorts disapprove of him, they found a 6 point gap between the older and younger cohort). And there were chasms in the difference of support for some of Trump's policies. When it came to ICE tactics, school vaccination requirements, and firings of federal workers, younger Gen Z men disapproved of Trump's position by much wider numbers than the older cohort.

The biggest divergence between the groups, however, came in their views of society and traditional gender norms. Older Gen Z men actually reported more conservative views than the younger cohort. They were more likely to agree that “things are generally better when men bring in money and women take care of the home and kids” or that “feminism favors women over men.” This cohort had more skeptical views toward gay and transgender people, as well.

These findings are notable because they seem to run counter to some of the other analyses of the divisions within Gen Z, which find that it's the younger cohort, not the older one, that tends to be more open to conservatism and the GOP.

“Young men as a whole are about the least ideological generation or demographic of any voting demographic there is, in terms of their views on different policies,” Charlie Sabgir, the author of the YRMP report, told me. They might appear on paper as more conservative as whole, he explained to me, “but in terms of actual policy and ideology, they just haven't committed themselves to any rigid set of beliefs in the same way that young women have [who are much more uniformly liberal and progressive on policy and ideology down the line.”

Sabgir acknowledged that some of the differences in social attitudes require more research to examine and connect to causes. Could it be TikTok and algorithmically powered streams of content? Specific influencers and content creators informing their perspectives? The natural aging into more conservative views that tended to happen with previous generations?

That causation is still unclear, he said. But, he was clear that there does seem to be an accelerating divide by age. At least when it comes to views of Trump, he said, “there's still a sense of shock at the pace at which events are happening,” that is hitting the youngest cohort differently than an older, more-jaded cohort that has seen a Trump presidency before. It would then make sense that the younger cohort that swung to him would swing away more aggressively. “Odds are they were not aware of just how unstable everything felt during that first administration,” he said. “So they would feel buyer's remorse.”

Other data sources, including other polls specifically focused on young voters, have tracked similar volatility and divisions within the youngest voting generation, even if they might diverge from the YMRP findings on ideology. The fall Harvard and Yale Youth Polls, for example, both tracked growing cynicism and disenchantment with the direction of the country, views of Trump, and volatile views on society and culture.

But the Yale Youth poll — which was one of the first to track a more conservative, GOP-friendly lean from younger Gen Z voters — again found a division in views in their most recent survey, published this month. The younger cohort was again less likely to say they were “liberal” and more likely to say they were “conservative” than the older cohort, according to Milan Singh, the founder and former director of the Yale Youth Poll.

They were more likely to approve of Trump's presidency and more likely to support some of his policies. “If you look through any of these questions where there's an age breakout, you can pretty much always see that the 18 to 22-year-olds are slightly more conservative than the 23- to 29-year olds,” Singh said. But, he emphasized that this isn't to say that every young person is “hardcore MAGA Republican, right winger.”

This divide raises an even bigger question: Are these young men more likely to be persuaded to vote in a different way because of economic concerns and disenchantment with Trump? Or, are these ideological differences strong and durable, presenting a future MAGA or Republican movement with eager young conservatives who would continue to move their generation to the right?

Singh holds that, though there is still a slightly more conservative lean — one exacerbated by gender — among 18- to 22-year-olds compared to those aged 23–29, these young men are still persuadable, as they don't necessarily hold firm ideological convictions. To buy the argument from some on the right that there's a rising generation of fervent right-wing youth driven by discrimination, “wokeness,” diversity initiatives, and progressive culture would be to misread the moment.

“You can stitch together a pretty clean narrative that a big reason that many young people voted for Trump in 2024, even though they may have typically voted for Democrats or you would expect them to be Democrats, was that they were really fed up by the cost of living. … Of course, you have to add footnotes that some young people may have had more conservative views and were kind of out of place in the current Democratic Party coalition,” Singh said. “But they've seen that not only has Trump not delivered on lowering the cost of living, his signature legislation in their mind makes it worse and benefits the billionaires at their expense, and now they're turning against it.”

Instead, what these divisions within Gen Z really suggest, G. Elliott Morris, a data journalist and polling and elections expert, told me, is that the dividing line among young Americans is the degree to which one cohort or the other is willing to just tear the whole system down.

“The way to reconcile these two things is to view the younger Gen Z cohort as significantly more anti-system, anti-incumbent and pessimistic [than the older cohort],” Morris said. “If you ask these two groups which direction they think the country is going, this group is much more likely to say ‘wrong track.' If you ask them if they're worried about their economic situation, they're also much more pessimistic. If their job opportunities from graduating or being in college during Covid were suppressed, then they would be significantly more a anti-Democratic party, anti-Harris in 2024, and then they would in turn also be more anti-Trump in 2025, 2026.”

And this becomes more obvious among young men, who are among the groups most likely to say that they are dissatisfied with Trump's handling of affordability and the economy after ranking it as their top concern ahead of 2024.

Sabgir, of the YMRP, agreed with some of this conclusion. In YMRP's May and October surveys, a plurality of the younger Gen Z cohort were still students or not full-time workers, and they reported more of a sense of financial instability and frustration with the state of the country. Their relative inexperience with life in a more unstable world than the one older Gen Z inhabited, therefore, might be contributing to this swing.

These differences will end up being consequential to future American elections — and politics, more generally. A lot of the last two years of discourse over young Americans has seemed to be pretty fatalistic or deterministic about their ideological views or swing-voter status — that they can't be trusted as Democratic voters; that they simply require more progressive outreach; or that they are dyed-in-the-wool Republican voters or “groypers” now. It turns out that, like other subsets, young voters — and young men specifically — aren't a monolith.

TikTok has unseated its social media rivals as the top spot for young people to get their news.

TikTok is now the most popular social app for news among 18- to 29-year-olds in the US, according to new survey data from the Pew Research Center. The app surpassed YouTube and Instagram, which were the top choices in 2024.

Forty-three percent of young adults said they regularly get news from TikTok in 2025, compared to 41% for both YouTube and Facebook. Forty percent named Instagram as a regular news source, while 21% said X (formerly Twitter) and 18% said Reddit.

Social media beat out every other format as a place where 18- to 29-year-olds said they get news, according to Pew's survey. Seventy-six percent of the cohort said they often or sometimes get news from social media, compared to 60% for news websites and 28% for email newsletters.

Half of the young adults who responded to Pew's survey said they have some or a lot of trust in social media as a news source. That roughly matched the level of trust the age group has for information from national news organizations.

TikTok has been rising quickly as a go-to source for news. In 2023, 32% of respondents named the video app as a place for regular news consumption.

Watching news on TikTok does not necessarily mean tuning into videos from traditional outlets like The Washington Post or NBC News. Young people view commentary from news influencers and user-generated videos tied to current events, such as from a war zone or protest, as news as well.

A new crop of independent news influencers has emerged to report on current events, including creators like Philip DeFranco and Vitus ""V"" Spehar's @underthedesknews.

Some professional news organizations, including NPR's ""Planet Money,"" have similarly centered videos on individual creators who can help build trust with their audiences. Gen Z social-media users told Business Insider that they are drawn to news creators who can deliver information in a more authentic and relatable manner.

Beyond news commentary, social media creators and podcasters have taken on a bigger role in news gathering in recent months. Politicians and government institutions are turning to podcasts and other formats to reach people, and content creators had a big presence at national conventions for the Democrats and Republicans last year. Many independent creators have applied for access to White House press briefings in 2025.

TikTok has introduced a handful of features tied to news on its app, including the ability for publishers to link to articles inside videos and a ""community notes"" style fact-checking tool called footnotes. It also works with ""independent fact-checkers in over 130 markets to determine if content is accurate,"" according to its website.

SoftBank said it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.

The Japanese conglomerate said it is doubling down on building the data centers, connectivity, and power needed to support AI at a global scale.

""As AI transforms industries worldwide, we need more compute, connectivity, power, and scalable infrastructure,"" said Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group.

The deal underscores SoftBank's push to control more of the physical infrastructure behind AI as competition for computing resources intensifies.

DigitalBridge will continue to operate as a separately managed platform following the deal, led by CEO Marc Ganzi.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

The acquisition also comes as SoftBank reshapes its bets on AI.

The company disclosed in November that it had sold nearly $6 billion worth of Nvidia stock. At the time, the company's CFO, Yoshimitsu Goto, said its decision to divest had ""nothing to do with Nvidia itself"" but was a way to reallocate its funds toward OpenAI. 

Goto said it plans to make the final part of its $30 billion investment in OpenAI by the end of the year.

The DigitalBridge deal also aligns with SoftBank's growing focus on what it calls ""physical AI,"" as the company ramps up investments in the real-world infrastructure — from data centers to robotics — needed to integrate AI into everyday life.

In this article

Lululemon Athletica's founder Chip Wilson said on Monday he had launched a proxy fight by nominating three independent directors to the company's board, just over two weeks after the apparel maker announced the exit of CEO Calvin McDonald without a clear successor.

Lululemon shares have shed nearly half their value this year as the company struggles to find its footing with younger and affluent shoppers, while battling stiff competition from fast-growing newer rivals such as Alo Yoga and Vuori, as well as pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.

Wilson has nominated three director candidates to Lululemon's board, including former On Running co-CEO Marc Maurer, former ESPN Chief Marketing Officer Laura Gentile and former Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg.

The board installed Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini as interim co-CEOs while they search for a permanent replacement.

Reuters had reported that Elliott Management, which disclosed a $1 billion stake in the company earlier this month, had been working closely for months with former Ralph Lauren executive Jane Nielsen for a potential CEO role.

When asked whether Wilson was teaming up with activist investor Elliott in pushing for the board change, a person familiar with Wilson's thinking said he was not working with any other investor. At the same time, Elliott's campaign for a new CEO would not interfere with his plans, the person added, asking not to be named.

Wilson had spoken to Nielsen, but any CEO selected by the company before board changes would not have Wilson's support, the source said.

""The recent CEO change announcement was the third total failure of board oversight, with no clear succession plan in place. Shareholders have no faith that this board can select and support the next CEO without input from a board with stronger product experience,"" Wilson said in a statement.

Lululemon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company's shares rose about 1% in morning trading.

""Adding three new board members seems like something that Lululemon would be willing to do. It might keep Wilson from constantly attacking the board, at least. The nominees appear to be fine, although only one of the three (Maurer) has direct experience in Lululemon's industry,"" Morningstar analyst David Swartz said.

Wilson likely did not ask for a board seat for himself as he owns a significant stake in Lululemon's competitor Amer Sports, Swartz added.

The Wall Street Journal first reported about Wilson launching a proxy fight against Lululemon's board earlier in the day.

Wilson is one of the biggest independent shareholders of Lululemon, with a 4.27% stake as of December 2025, according to LSEG data.

The yogawear maker's founder had previously called for an urgent search for a CEO to replace McDonald, led by new, independent directors with a deep knowledge of the company to restore a ""product-first"" mindset at the company.

This is not the first time Wilson has pushed for changes at Lululemon's board.

After founding the apparel company in 1998, Wilson withdrew from daily operations in 2012 and resigned as chairman a year later following a recall of see-through yoga pants that led to the departures of top executives amid a public-relations storm.

He also quit the director post in 2015 after clashing with the board over strategy. However, a proxy fight was averted after Wilson agreed to sell about half of his 27% stake to private-equity firm Advent International for $845 million in return for two additional director positions.

Japan's SoftBank on Monday said it has agreed to buy data center investment firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion as part of its artificial intelligence push.

The deal, which has been unanimously approved by a special committee of DigitalBridge's board of directors, will see SoftBank acquire all the outstanding common stock of DigitalBridge for $16 per share in cash. 

This represents a 15% premium to DigitalBridge's closing share price on Dec. 26. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, according to a SoftBank statement.

SoftBank CEO and Chairman Masayoshi Son said the acquisition ""will strengthen the foundation for next-generation AI data centers"" and advance the firm's vision to become a leading ""Artificial Super Intelligence"" platform provider.

""As AI transforms industries worldwide, we need more compute, connectivity, power, and scalable infrastructure,"" Son said in a statement.

Shares of DigitalBridge last jumped about 10%. The firm's share price had climbed as much as 50% after Bloomberg reported a deal could be imminent.

The agreement between SoftBank and DigitalBridge comes amid a global boom for the infrastructure that underpins AI applications.

""The buildout of AI infrastructure represents one of the most significant investment opportunities of our generation,"" DigitalBridge CEO Marc Ganzi said in a statement.

SoftBank's ""vision, capital strength, and global network will allow us to accelerate our mission with greater flexibility, invest with a longer-term horizon on behalf of our investors, and better serve the world's leading technology companies as they scale their AI ambitions,"" he added.

SoftBank recently sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion to make room for its investment in OpenAI.

DigitalBridge describes itself as ""a unique digital infrastructure business,"" and had roughly $108 billion of assets under management as of the end of September, according to its website.

BEIJING — China plans to restrict artificial intelligence-powered chatbots from influencing human emotions in ways that could lead to suicide or self-harm, according to draft rules released Saturday.

The proposed regulations from the Cyberspace Administration target what it calls ""human-like interactive AI services,"" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese-language document.

The measures, once finalized, will apply to AI products or services offered to the public in China that simulate human personality and engage users emotionally through text, images, audio or video. The public comment period ends Jan. 25.

Beijing's planned rules would mark the world's first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. The latest proposals come as Chinese companies have rapidly developed AI companions and digital celebrities.

Compared with China's generative AI regulation in 2023, Ma said that this version ""highlights a leap from content safety to emotional safety.""

The draft rules propose that: 

Additional provisions would require tech providers to remind users after two hours of continuous AI interaction and mandate security assessments for AI chatbots with more than 1 million registered users or over 100,000 monthly active users.

The document also encouraged the use of human-like AI in ""cultural dissemination and elderly companionship.""

The proposal comes shortly after two leading Chinese AI chatbot startups, Z.ai and Minimax, filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong this month.

Minimax is best known internationally for its Talkie AI app, which allows users to chat with virtual characters. The app and its domestic Chinese version, Xingye, accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue in the first three quarters of the year, with an average of over 20 million monthly active users during that time.

Z.ai, also known as Zhipu, filed under the name ""Knowledge Atlas Technology."" While the company did not disclose monthly active users, it noted its technology ""empowered"" around 80 million devices, including smartphones, personal computers and smart vehicles.

Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comments on how the proposed rules could affect their IPO plans.

Overt AI influence on human behavior has come under increasing scrutiny this year.

Sam Altman, CEO of U.S.-based ChatGPT operator OpenAI, in September said that one of the most difficult issues for the company is how its chatbot responds to suicide-related conversations. The prior month, a family in the U.S. filed a lawsuit against OpenAI after their teenage son died by suicide.

Reflecting growing urgency, OpenAI over the weekend announced it is hiring a ""Head of Preparedness"" to assess AI risks from the impact on mental health to cybersecurity.

Many people are also turning to AI for relationships. This month, a woman in Japan married her AI boyfriend. 

Two platforms focused on virtual character interaction, Character.ai and Polybuzz.ai, ranked among the 15 most popular AI chatbots and tools, according to SimilarWeb rankings for November. 

The proposed domestic measures follow China's broader push over the past year to shape global rules on AI governance.

As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.

The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. 

The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. 

The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.

While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.

""Middle managers are more important than ever,"" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. 

In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. 

Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.

To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.

Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. 

A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.

In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.

One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. 

Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.

""I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,"" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. ""[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.""

Managers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.

The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.

Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.

Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. 

Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.

""Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,"" Withinton says. ""And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.""

Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow? Time will tell.

LONDON — European stocks closed mixed on Monday, with defense stocks continuing to struggle amid a possible peace deal in Ukraine.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index stood little changed at close, having hit an intraday record high of 589.61 points earlier in the session but finishing the day at 589.35 points, a 0.11% gain.

The U.K.'s FTSE index traded marginally lower, finished down 0.04%. France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX finished 0.10% higher, while and Italy's FTSE MIB was down 0.38%.

European defense stocks dipped following weekend peace talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Stocks fell in the morning and early afternoon but pared some losses in later trading. Shares of Leonardo fell 1.96% and Rheinmetall dropped around 1%, while Renk, Kongsberg, and Saab were also down at the close. The Stoxx Europe aerospace and defense index was 1.53% lower.

While peace talks could lead to a setback for defense stocks, Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen told CNBC that ""it will quickly be apparent that the investments needed in defense in Europe will continue and they will accelerate massively over the next years."" 

""Definitely a positive potential for European equities if we get some kind of peace,"" Pedersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

Silver climbed above $80 an ounce for the first time early Monday before pulling back. The precious metal was last seen trading at $71.55 an ounce. Gold dropped 1.6% to last trade at $4,355 an ounce, and copper fell 4.2% to $5.59 an ounce.

Trading volumes could be lighter this week, given the ongoing Christmas holidays and with regional markets set to close on Thursday for New Year's Day.

Oil prices rose as investors weighed the prospects of a deal to end the war in Ukraine, though the prospect of a deal before the year's out is fading after Trump and Zelenskyy said on Sunday that progress had been made during talks to end the war but that ""one or two very thorny issues"" remained.

U.S. crude oil rose 2.3% to $58.04 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent gained 2% to $61.89. Both benchmarks fell about 2% on Friday.

Ukraine and Russia remain far apart when it comes to territorial concessions demanded by Russia and security guarantees coveted by Ukraine. 

Speaking to reporters following talks in Florida on Sunday, Zelenskyy said they had come to an agreement on around ""90%"" of a 20-point peace plan and that the leaders had fully agreed on security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump was slightly less bullish on that front, saying an agreement was ""close to 95%"" done.

There are no major European earnings or data releases on Monday.

The ripple effects from Europe's growing appetite for raw materials extend all the way to Sweden's far north. 

Thousands of residents and buildings are being uprooted in Kiruna, a city that lies 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. The relocation project is regarded as one of the world's most radical urban transformations.

Kiruna is physically on the move because of ground subsidence from the expansion of a sprawling underground iron ore mine. A new home is being created about 3 kilometers east of the old town as part of a multi-decade process that's expected to be completed by 2035. 

""It's a place that would seem exotic to so many and, in a way, I guess it is, but also it is a small town like so many others — struggling with what they are struggling with and challenged by being so dependent on one company,"" Jennie Sjöholm, senior lecturer at Sweden's University of Gothenburg, told CNBC by video call.  

Established 125 years ago as a city for the iron ore mining operations of state-owned firm LKAB, Kiruna is a small community that serves as both a significant European space hub and home to the world's largest underground iron ore mine. 

LKAB is small in global terms but a highly significant regional player, accounting for 80% of all iron ore mined in the European Union. 

Alongside its iron ore operations, which are integral to the steel-making process, LKAB recently identified one of Europe's largest known deposits of rare earths, further strengthening its position in the extraction of essential materials for the green transition. 

There are several obstacles to the successful relocation of Kiruna, with players across the spectrum raising political, economic and environmental concerns. Indeed, both the municipality and LKAB have called for greater financial support from the state, as well as the release of more land to accommodate the transformation. 

Others have also flagged concerns about the relationship between resource extraction and community sustainability, particularly regarding the potential impact on indigenous Sami reindeer herding and culture. 

The city's relocation, which was first planned in 2004, received international attention in August 2025 during the spectacular move of its iconic Kiruna Church. In a feat of engineering, the 113-year-old timber building was moved in its entirety by specialized trailers over a period of two days. 

At around the same time, however, LKAB also announced the expansion of its iron ore mine would require the relocation of an additional 6,000 people and 2,700 homes. The mining company, which is responsible for the move, has estimated compensation costs of 22.5 billion SEK ($2.4 billion) over the next 10 years.

Niklas Johansson, senior vice president of public affairs and external relations at LKAB, told CNBC that those being asked to relocate were being offered the market value of their property, plus an additional 25%, or the construction of a new home. Around 90% have elected to take a new house, Johansson said. 

""The problem at the moment is that the local municipality has very little land that they own [or] that they can make, from an administrative point of view, buildable,"" Johansson said.

""They have had to buy land from the state, who owns most of the land above the Arctic Circle. And here you have conflicts with reindeer herding, conflicts with defense, conflicts with nature, etcetera,"" he added.  

Mats Taaveniku, chairman of the municipal council in Kiruna, described the city's relocation as a ""huge project,"" that could yield major opportunities for European citizens for decades to come. 

A successful outcome, he added, hinges in part on greater financial and political support from both the Swedish government and the European Union. 

""We have what we can call a big fight between the municipality and LKAB, and the municipality and our own government,"" Taaveniku told CNBC by video call. 

""The EU has to step up to support us. It's not enough to make a decision that we have critical and strategic minerals. They have to support us with political statements and money, of course,"" he added. 

CNBC has contacted spokespeople for the Swedish government and the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. 

The EU, for its part, has recognized LKAB's new rare earths deposit as strategically important under its Critical Raw Materials Act, a policy that aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's annual demand by 2030.

Asked how Kiruna residents have reacted to the relocation effort, Taaveniku said: ""Some of the citizens are sad because they will lose a lot of memories. They have grown up in a house for two or maybe three generations, so this is sad.""

""But on the other hand, everybody knows, we live on the minerals,"" he said. ""Kiruna is built on the minerals, so every resident in Kiruna knows that we have to move from our homes sooner or later because we are dependent on this mining industry."" 

For those on the move, one aspect that has raised concerns is that Kiruna's new city may be up to 10 degrees Celsius colder in the winter. 

A study by the University of Gothenburg found that Kiruna's new city center is laid out in a grid pattern in an area where cold air collects, with tall buildings and narrow streets, meaning that the low sun will likely have difficulty reaching the ground for many months of the year.

""Kiruna is a winter city. It's a cold, Arctic city. The winters are long, and you have a long snow season. It is rarely -35 [degrees Celsius] but it could be that cold for a period of time in mid-winter and it's a very big difference between -15, which is not uncommon, and -25,"" Sjöholm said. A built heritage specialist, Sjöholm has been following the work on the city's relocation for 25 years.

""It's already a long winter season and if it's cold, human comfort decreases but also things get more fragile, so to speak,"" she added.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Joy to the investor! While some market participants worried that the so-called Santa Claus rally wouldn't materialize this year, the major indexes all notched wins in last week's holiday-shortened trading period. The S&P 500 also gave traders the gift of new all-time highs.

Here's what to know:

Thousands of flights were canceled or delayed over the weekend as a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S. The disruptions come during the busy holiday travel period, when more than 50 million people are expected to fly.

As CNBC's Leslie Josephs reports, airlines including American, Delta, United, Southwest and JetBlue waived change fees last week for travelers flying in and out of several airports in the Northeast. But customers need to travel by the end of the year — in other words, by the time the Times Square ball drops — if they changed their travel plans due to the storm.

President Donald Trump spent yesterday talking with Ukrainian and Russian leaders as he continued to push for a peace deal between the two countries.

Trump welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Before beginning talks, Trump said that ""we have the makings of a deal that is good for Ukraine"" and ""good for everybody."" Afterward, Trump said ""we're getting a lot closer"" to an agreement. Zelenskyy said this morning that he asked Trump for up to 50 years of security guarantees for Ukraine.

Earlier on Sunday, Trump said in a Truth Social post that he had a ""good and very productive telephone call"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said he planned to call Putin again after finishing his meeting with Zelenskyy.

Groq is calling Nvidia's acquisition of its top talent a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement."" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a report that the structure may be used to avoid antitrust concerns and ""keep the fiction of competition alive.""

As CNBC's Ari Levy reports, Groq would be Nvidia's largest acquisition on record. But the world's most valuable company is instead choosing to pay for the startup's top talent and access to its technology through licensing — a popular strategy among major tech firms in recent years.

For some on Wall Street, the agreement underscores Nvidia's ballooning size. ""They're so big now that they can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release and nobody bats an eye,"" Rasgon told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Friday.

Value was a hot topic among some restaurant chains this year as they tried to keep price-conscious consumers coming in their doors. McDonald's extended its $5 value meal and brought back Extra Value Meals. Taco Bell followed suit by expanding its Luxe Cravings box offerings this year.

As CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports, that strategy will likely stick around in 2026.

The emphasis on value comes as data shows diners are more focused on costs after years of high inflation. But not all restaurant chains have jumped on the bandwagon: Fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Cava have tried to avoid discounting and instead zeroed in on quality.

Here's what we're watching in this four-day trading week:

South Korean online retail giant Coupang said it will offer 1.69 trillion South Korean won ($1.17 billion) in compensation to 34 million users affected by a massive data breach disclosed last month.

The company said in a statement Monday local time that it planned to provide customers with purchase vouchers totaling 50,000 won for various Coupang services.

Former customers who closed their Coupang accounts following the data breach are also eligible to receive the vouchers. 

Coupang said users can check their eligibility for the vouchers starting Jan. 15, according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean.

Harold Rogers, interim CEO for Coupang Corp., described the move as a ""responsible measure for our customers,"" and said the company would ""fulfill its responsibilities to the end."" 

""I once again deeply apologize to our customers,"" he said in the statement. 

Rogers' apology came a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom also apologized, saying that he was ""devastated"" by the disappointment people have experienced. 

The data breach, which was revealed on Nov. 18, led to the resignation of CEO Park Dae-jun earlier this month.

Coupang founder Kim Bom said in a separate statement that the company had failed to communicate clearly from the outset of the incident.

The U.S.-based chairman acknowledged his apology was ""overdue,"" explaining that he initially believed it was best to communicate publicly and apologize only after all the facts were confirmed.

""In retrospect, this was a poor judgment. While Coupang worked tirelessly to resolve the situation, I should have expressed my deepest regrets and sincere apologies from the beginning. My heart has been heavy ever since I first learned of the data breach,"" Kim said.

Kim added that the company has recovered all the leaked customer information through cooperation with the government, as well as the storage devices belonging to a suspect behind the data breach.

He also said the customer information stored on the suspect's computer was limited to 3,000 records and that it was not distributed or sold externally.

Crypto:

Bitcoin briefly topped the $90,000 mark on Monday before tumbling, leaving traders waiting on a potential breakout after the token missed a Santa rally that sent stocks to record highs. 

The original cryptocurrency rose as much as 3.1% to trade above $90,200 in Asian trading hours on Monday. It later pared those gains to sink back below $88,000 by 9 a.m. in New York. Other cryptocurrencies had also swung, with Ether up as much as 4% to surpass $3,000 before dropping into the red.

Bitcoin BTC$87,794.18 whales, or holders with at least 1,000 BTC, have been the dominant buyers since the price of the largest cryptocurrency bottomed near $80,000 at the end of November, according to Glassnode data. They remain the strongest accumulators as bitcoin trades just below $90,000.

According to Glassnode data, the 1,000-10,000 BTC cohort is the only group showing sustained accumulation, with an Accumulation Trend Score close to 1. 

The metric breaks down buying and selling behavior across wallet cohorts, measuring both the size of entities and the net amount of bitcoin they have acquired over the past 15 days. A score closer to 1 indicates accumulation, while a score closer to 0 signals distribution. 

The data suggests that large holders have been accumulating bitcoin in the $80,000 range, a price level bitcoin has not traded in for an extended period compared with other price buckets. 

This behavior contrasts sharply with smaller holders, all of whom show varying degrees of distribution. 

Given that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has remained in ""fear"" or ""extreme fear"" for roughly the past 30 days, this selling pressure from smaller entities likely reflects capitulation. 

Meanwhile, the 10,000-plus BTC whale cohort was aggressively buying when bitcoin traded near $80,000 in late November, though they have begun to slow over recent weeks. Still, as a cohort they are not yet selling, which was the dominant behavior the the BTC price topped $100,000 around mid-year.

Oops, something went wrong

Cleanspark Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) is one of the best bitcoin mining stocks to buy according to Hedge Funds.

As of December 24 closing, forecasts remain strong for Cleanspark Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) with a consensus 1-year average price target of $24.30. This results in an upside potential of over 113% for investors, after yielding almost 74% already in 2025. The stock has been covered by 10 analysts, all of whom have given Buy calls.

Gregory Lewis from BTIG was one of those analysts who reiterated his bullish stance on Cleanspark Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK). The analyst assigned a Buy rating to the stock on December 15, with a $26 price target. As per Lewis's estimates, there is still an upside potential of around 128% for investors.

Earlier in December, Cleanspark Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) shared its bitcoin mining data for the month of November. The management revealed mining of 587 bitcoins during the month, and an increase in contracted power by 11% during the process.

CEO and Chairman Matt Schultz said:

“CleanSpark's progress this year reflects what's possible when a team believes in a shared mission. Last month, we expanded our contracted power to over 1.4 GW with an additional 125 MW in TVA's service territory and had a successful closing of our $1.15 billion zero-coupon convertible notes offering. Our team is focused on expanding CleanSpark's contracted power, continuing to mine efficiently, and positioning the business to rapidly lease existing capacity while maintaining optionality to shift hashrate to optimal segments of the portfolio. We are proud of fiscal 2025 and even more excited for the road ahead.”

Cleanspark Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK) is labeled as “America's Bitcoin Miner”. The company operates an extensive network of bitcoin mining assets across the U.S., which have gigawatts of mining capacity. The company is now making a strategic pivot towards high-performance computing and AI by leveraging its current infrastructure asset base.

While we acknowledge the potential of CLSK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Ethereum has been having a hard time over the last few months after hitting a brand new all-time high back in August 2025. The last quarter of the year has been especially brutal, with the cryptocurrency's price down more than 29% in Q4 2025. Despite this abysmal performance, things have failed to turn around, with technical indicators continuing to point to further decline for the altcoin. The latest of these is the appearance of a descending triangle structure, that carried the promise of further downside.

Ethereum Price Is Still Not Bullish

As crypto analyst Alpha Trade Scope points out in a TradingView post, the Ethereum price chart is still showing major signs of weakness. For example, the digital asset saw its price crash below a descending trendline, and this has marked the continuation of the downtrend that began three months ago.

The current price trend has led to the formation of a descending triangle structure, which emerged after the cryptocurrency completed an impulse move. Not only this, the trend of recording lower highs has been evidence of the increased selling pressure on the cryptocurrency. Doing this below the aforementioned descending trendline just lends credence to the fact that the downtrend is not over.

There has also been a major shift in the market structure of the Ethereum price. For one, there was a Change of Character (CHoCH), which shows that the Ethereum price is no longer bullish, but is rather more bearish at this point.

Resistance has also mounted at the $3,000 level over time, and the price has been trading well below this resistance for a while now. Also, the Ethereum price is caught in a tight range, trading within the Fair Value Gap (FVG) mapped out between $2,930 and $2,960. This shows the rising resistance at this level, that could serve as a rejection in the case of a recovery attempt.

How Low Can The ETH Price Go?

If the current bearish trend holds and the Ethereum price does get rejected, then the first target for the downside lies at $2,815. This first target serves as the first support for the cryptocurrency and the destination for an initial liquidity sweep as investors sell into the decline. However, it is not the final target.

In the case of a further break, then $2,800 is expected to give way, leading to the second major target at $2,748. This target is more of a major demand zone and is more likely to trigger a bounce due to the mounting buying pressure at this point. “The chart presents a classic bearish continuation setup, favoring downside expansion if support breaks with confirmation,” the analyst said.

                            BTC and ETH ETFs continue to see another week of outflow. Source: Getty Images.                        

Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to experience massive outflows towards the end of the year.

At a time when BTC and ETH investment products continue to see outflows, Solana and XRP ETFs have maintained their market-defying momentum, recording their most significant weekly inflows since inception.

Crypto investment products saw outflows  of $446 million last week, bringing total outflows since the October 10th shock price decline to $3.2 billion.

Despite the recent drawdown, year-to-date inflows remain robust at $46.3 billion, slightly below 2024's $48.7 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) are still up 10% YTD.

Bitcoin investment products accounted for the bulk of last week's outflows, shedding $443 million, while Ethereum products followed with $59.5 million in outflows.

In contrast, newer products continued to attract capital. Solana and XRP ETFs both posted their strongest weekly inflows since launch, defying the broader trend.

XRP ETFs recorded $79 million in net inflows, while Solana ETFs added more than $7.5 million.

The divergence suggests investor confidence is becoming increasingly selective, with capital rotating toward XRP and Solana exposure even as funds continue to exit Bitcoin and Ethereum products.

Examining the weekly flow of crypto investment products, investors remain cautious about the value of BTC and ETH heading into the end of the year.

BTC's price reclaimed $90,000, while the ETH price climbed above $ 3,000.

However, like several past instances since October, both tokens failed to sustain the bullish momentum and lost all of their gains within hours of breaking past key resistance.

On the other hand, altcoin spot prices remain in the bearish zone; however, due to the recent launch of these products, investors are more open to taking risks with them, as evident from XRP's zero outflow days, while Solana has seen key inflows from time to time.

The United States remains the hub of most flows, owing to the launch of some of the largest ETF products in the country.

Germany's inflows suggest opportunistic buying during market dips, while the US dominated the negative flows.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin BTC$87,794.18 reversed gains made earlier in Asia, puncturing nascent recovery rallies in major alternative cryptocurrencies. 

The leading cryptocurrency by market value dropped below $88,000, having peeped above $90,000, CoinDesk data show. Major altcoins including XRP$1.8660, ether ETH$2,940.97, solana SOL$123.72 and DOGE$0.1239 also retraced their adances. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) pulled back to 2,726, roughly where it was in early Asia before it popped to 2,789. 

The decline is consistent with weakness in stock index futures. As of writing, futures tied to Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index traded 0.5% lower on the day, pointing to a cautious start to trading. 

BTC and the Nasdaq share a strong positive correlation that becomes more pronounced during Nasdaq downtrends, according to Wintermute.

The pullback led traders to slightly scale back their leveraged bets. Data from Coinglass shows that cumulative open interest in futures listed worldwide declined to around 533,000 BTC from the 540,000 BTC seen earlier today. Open interest had popped from 524,000 BTC as the bitcoin price rose to $90,000. 

The cryptocurrency has recently tended to underperform during U.S. hours, according to Laser Digital.

""An interesting trend to take note of has been the distinct underperformance during the US timezone. (both BTC, ETH down 3%+ over US hours [last week] offset by strength during Asian hours) driven most likely by selling pressure coming from the year-end tax harvesting flow as crypto has been a large underperformer among global assets this year,"" analysts at Laser Digital wrote in an analysis note Monday.

John Glover, an Elliott wave expert and chief investment officer at crypto lender Ledn, signaled a bullish outlook. 

""The Bitcoin price chart looks very promising for higher prices in the future, but less certainty in the near term. I continue to look for the market to trade sideways to slightly lower in the coming weeks/months, and look to add to longs between $71k and $84k,"" Glover told CoinDesk in an email.

The new offering, from the company's SQD Network subsidiary, is designed to bolster rising demand from large enterprise and institutional customers, Rezolve said in a Monday (Dec. 29) news release.

“SQD provides high-performance blockchain data services to major global organizations, including Deutsche Telekom and top DeFi protocols such as Morpho and PancakeSwap whose platforms are designed to require continuous, large-scale access to real-time and historical data,” the release said.

“SQD's Revenue Pool model is designed to fund SQD's infrastructure capacity directly by customer payments as customer usage grows, reinforcing long-term sustainability and alignment between customer usage and economics.”

Resolve said large customers pay to subscribe to data services, and delivering that service at scale requires committed infrastructure capacity by SQD.

With the Revenue Pool, SQD Token holders can temporarily lock their SQD tokens to help bolster that capacity. Tokens are retained by the owner but cannot be moved or sold while locked. When customers pay, a piece of that payment may be shared with the participants, who are compensated in stablecoins.

“In short, customers pay for the service and those who help support it may share in the income it generates,” the release said.

Rezolve says this is important for the SQD ecosystem because as blockchain data “becomes increasingly mission-critical across business operations, payments, analytics and enterprise systems, infrastructure economics matter.”

PYMNTS spoke earlier this year with Rezolve Ai CEO Daniel Wagner about the changing face of eCommerce as consumers seek personalization, guidance and immediacy.

“The way in which we navigate eCommerce is not good,” Wagner told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster for the Monday Conversation series. “It served its purpose for nearly 30 years, but it is no longer ideal.”

As the report added, anyone who has tried to find a product online has gone through a pattern of entering a search term, combing through results and often abandoning their effort. It's a poor replacement for the personalized, conversational experience that comes with speaking in-store with a knowledgeable salesperson.

But Wagner said he believes that a transformation is taking place, one where digital retail, helped by artificial intelligence, must finally provide the intuitive, responsive experience consumers have long taken for granted in brick-and-mortar stores.

“When you walk into a physical store, 7 out of 10 times you end up walking out with a product,” he said. “When you arrive on a digital platform, 7 out of 10 times, you do not leave with a product.”

December 29, 2025 @ 12:56 pm By Omar Faridi 

BLIFE Protocol, a “decentralized” protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain focused on integrating Web3 applications and cultural experiences, announced it has merged with Portal, an interoperability and liquidity infrastructure for Web3 gaming centered on the utility token PORTAL. The combined business will “operate under the Portal brand.”

Portal will now reportedly maintain its support for cross‑chain gaming and broader interoperability while “integrating BLIFE's Bitcoin‑based projects.”

 Benjamin Charbit, former Ubisoft game director for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, will lead Portal as CEO.

Animoca Brands, a global firm focused on digital assets and Web3 and an early supporter of BLIFE, will support “the relaunch of Portal by providing new capital and relevant gaming portfolio connections to strengthen Portal's business and advance its roadmap.”

G-20 will also support as an “ecosystem and strategic partner.”

BLIFE develops Web3‑native experiences “for the Bitcoin ecosystem, aiming to bridge Bitcoin with broader Web3 activity.”

Over the past two years BLIFE has built and “accelerated key infrastructure and products to expand Web3 adoption on Bitcoin, including BLIFE.ID, the first identity passport inscribed on Bitcoin, and Odin.fun, a fast-growing memecoin trading platform.”

​BLIFE has cultivated one of the largest Bitcoin communities “focused on Web3 and gaming.”

BLIFE's products have brought Bitcoin users into Web3, “creating a highly engaged community that complements Portal's cross chain audience.”

​In mid-2025, BLIFE acquired Beyond, “a tridirectional Bitcoin L1 bridge that connects Bitcoin to other major chains.”

Beyond is preparing for its mainnet launch and “will become part of Portal's interoperability stack.”

This addition will provide Portal with native Bitcoin connectivity and a proprietary cross chain bridge, “positioning Portal as the natural entry point for Bitcoin users who want to access Web3 gaming.”

​The merger of BLIFE and Portal brings BLIFE's ecosystem into Portal's interoperability-focused infrastructure, which “includes Portal Hub, the discovery and interoperability platform of Portal.”

Portal's mission is to connect “every chain, pool, and game into one universal liquidity layer, allowing any on-chain game to tap into deep liquidity across the entire Web3 ecosystem, and establishing a definitive infrastructure layer for cross-chain gaming.”

Portal is an omnichain Web3 gaming platform designed “to unify the fragmented blockchain gaming landscape, establishing a single ecosystem for both game distribution and player engagement.”

Its core mission is to make “discovering and playing Web3 games seamless and frictionless, enabling users to engage with titles across various blockchain networks without the need for complex asset bridging or swapping.”

Portal's flagship discovery and interoperability platform is called Portal Hub.

Portal utilizes an omnichain infrastructure, “including a proprietary cross-chain liquidity layer called Portal Pay.”

Portal Pay allows users to pay with any “supported cryptocurrency while ensuring merchants receive their preferred asset.”

Portal's native utility token, PORTAL, is an Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) with “a total supply of one billion.”

PORTAL token is central to the ecosystem, “serving as the key currency for transactions, governance participation, and staking to drive economic activity within the Portal network.”

BLIFE Protocol is setting a course “at the forefront of Bitcoin‘s core principles and the uncharted territories of the Bitcoin ecosystem.”

Facing a digital ecosystem that is said to be riddled with fragmentation and limited accessibility, BLIFE's stated goal / aim is to effectively “reshape the future of digital currency and virtual interaction.”

Colle AI (COLLE), the multichain AI-powered NFT creation platform, announced an expansion of its intelligent NFT structuring capabilities, designed to better support creators operating high-volume production pipelines. The enhanced framework introduces deeper automation and adaptive logic into how NFTs are organized, assembled, and prepared for deployment, enabling creators to manage large-scale workflows with greater speed and reliability across decentralized environments.

The expanded structuring system improves how Colle AI interprets creative inputs and translates them into coherent asset architectures. By automatically organizing visual layers, metadata hierarchies, and compositional relationships, the platform removes much of the manual coordination traditionally required in large NFT projects. This allows artists, studios, and brands to generate extensive collections while maintaining structural consistency and reducing production friction, even as output volume increases.

Embedded directly into Colle AI's multichain pipelines, the upgraded structuring intelligence ensures assets remain compatible with the technical requirements of networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and the XRP Ledger. As creators scale their pipelines, the system dynamically preserves formatting accuracy, metadata integrity, and deployment readiness across chains. “High-volume NFT creation depends on strong structural foundations,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “By expanding intelligent structuring, Colle AI enables creators to scale confidently while the platform manages complexity across multichain environments.”

This enhancement reflects Colle AI's continued focus on building high-performance creative infrastructure tailored for modern Web3 demands. As creator pipelines grow in size and sophistication, Colle AI remains committed to evolving its intelligent systems to deliver fast, adaptive, and scalable solutions that empower creators to focus on innovation rather than operational overhead.

Traders are flocking to Solana-based tokens.

NFTs don't feel like they used to. Trading is slower, and a lot of people just… seem to have moved on. That doesn't mean traders are done taking risks. The attention has gone back to memecoins, especially those built on Solana [SOL].

Over the past year, overall NFT activity has gradually decreased, with few spikes and a flat trading pattern across marketplaces. What's interesting is where the remaining volume is going. NFT market share has become increasingly concentrated, with OpenSea and Blur accounting for the bulk of total trading volume, while smaller platforms lose relevance.

Source: Dune Analytics

A handful of marketplaces dominate NFT trading, while most others contribute only a sliver of activity. Interest is shrinking, with traders sticking to the most liquid venues and avoiding risk.

NFTs are definitely losing pace, and they are no longer where the spotlight is right now.

Source: Coinmarketcap

CoinMarketCap data shows consistent volume across the largest memecoins; big names like Dogecoin [DOGE], Shiba Inu [SHIB], Pepe [PEPE] are proof – even on tame days, their numbers are astounding. Newer entrants are seeing strong daily trading activity too. Many of the most actively traded tokens over the past week are either native to Solana or heavily traded on it.

Source: Coinmarketcap

This is where the network stands out. Several Solana-based memecoins post high volume despite smaller market caps; they're frequently traded rather than held long-term. Low transaction fees and fast settlement make it easier for traders to enter and exit positions quickly. This keeps activity elevated.

This was perhaps what lead to the quick rotation from NFTs.

It's not just about NFTs versus memecoins; it's about how traders want to participate. Capital is moving toward fast, flexible and constantly engaging assets. Memecoins fit that need better right now than NFTs, which often require patience, higher upfront costs, and longer holding periods.

Another change is scale. Memecoins allow smaller traders to stay active without committing large amounts of money. That's harder in both NFTs and large-cap crypto. There's more participation, even if it is mindless fun. Traders are choosing markets that let them move quickly,  and step away just as fast.

MUSE ENT NFT USD (MSCTUSD) is currently priced at $0.00015000663, with a change percentage of 0.0%. Though it seems to be at a standstill, it's crucial to examine why the price is stable and what future forecasts predict for this cryptocurrency.

Currently, MSCTUSD is holding steady at $0.00015000663, unchanged in its percentage move for today. The trading volume is notably small at 19, compared to an average volume of 8, indicating low trading activity. The year's low sits at $0.00015, suggesting that it is currently at the threshold, with its year high significantly higher at $0.005781.

Technical indicators highlight a flat market for MSCTUSD. The RSI, MACD, and ADX are all at 0.00, showing neither oversold nor overbought conditions, which predicts continued stability in the absence of new market catalysts. With a MFI of 50.00 and an RVI of 50.00, the coin seems to be in a neutral position. This neutrality is reinforced by the absence of significant trends as observed in envelopes and oscillators.

Looking ahead, Meyka AI has forecasted a potential rise in MSCTUSD's price, projecting it could reach $0.00797357851483382 in a year and possibly $0.0838042254844757 in seven years. These forecasts suggest optimism over the mid to long-term. However, forecasts can change due to macroeconomic shifts, regulations, or unexpected events affecting the crypto market.

Despite the current stagnation, the market sentiment around MSCTUSD remains cautiously optimistic, buoyed by the broader interest in NFT-related assets. The significant drop from previous highs indicates past bearish pressures, but the potential for recovery suggests latent investor interest that may resurface with broader industry developments.

While MSCTUSD remains stable today, the data indicates potential long-term growth. Investors should watch for any developments in the NFT space that could drive future price changes, keeping in mind the volatile nature of crypto markets.

As of now, MSCTUSD is priced at $0.00015000663 with no percentage change for the day. The market activity appears low with a volume of 19 compared to the average of 8.

Technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and ADX are at 0.00, suggesting no current trend direction. This neutrality means the price is likely to stay stable unless influenced by new market factors.

Meyka AI forecasts suggest that MSCTUSD could see considerable growth over the years, with potential prices reaching up to $0.0838042254844757 in seven years.

The stability is due to low trading volumes and the absence of significant market-moving news or trends, keeping the price unchanged despite prior significant lows and highs.

Yes, macroeconomic shifts, regulatory changes, or unexpected market events can influence MSCTUSD prices, as with any cryptocurrency. It's essential to monitor these factors closely.

Ourbit SuperCEX




SINGAPORE, Dec.  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ourbit SuperCEX has officially concluded its flagship year-end user appreciation campaign, “Cosmic Wheel.” According to official data, the event featured a prize pool of 2,600,000 USDT, drawing nearly 60,000 participants and 400 competing teams. The campaign's highest individual reward reached 2,001.68 USDT. A key highlight was the debut of the limited-edition “ourbie” NFT, which offers holders future platform token airdrops and high-value ecosystem perks, sparking significant market interest.

Futures War: Total Trading Volume Reaches $2.2 Billion

As part of the “Cosmic Wheel” campaign, the Futures War team competition recorded a total trading volume of approximately 2.23 billion USDT. The event highlighted both concentrated trading activity and wide participation across teams.

The top three teams by trading volume were:

Analysing the trading structure and team performance, the Futures War revealed a unique competitive landscape in which top-tier dominance coincided with broad-based participation. With nearly 400 teams involved, the event achieved both high concentration and high vitality, deepening engagement across diverse user segments and significantly amplifying the overall competitive intensity.

The Fortune Draw: A Task-Driven Interactive Experience

In addition to the Futures War, The Fortune Draw was a key interactive component of the “Cosmic Wheel” campaign. Backed by a 600,000 USDT prize pool, the event employed a task-based mechanism—“Complete Tasks – Earn Draws – Unlock Prizes”—to support user engagement through a gamified structure.

The event was extended from two phases to three, and most participants received various rewards, including USDT, $BITCH tokens, and limited-edition “ourbie” NFTs.

According to official Ourbit sources, all rewards from The Fortune Draw are expected to be distributed by December 28, 23:59 (UTC+8).

'Ourbie' NFT: A Gateway to Long-Term Ecosystem Value

The limited-edition ourbie NFT emerged as a focal point of the campaign, positioned as a vital credential for Ourbit's long-term ecosystem value. Official disclosures reveal that holders will be eligible for future platform token airdrops and exclusive platform privileges.

While many users secured the NFT via the Fortune Draw, Ourbit also opened a public sales channel for those who missed out or wished to accumulate more. Users could acquire the NFT for 10,000 $BITCH. Furthermore, Ourbit established an official buyback mechanism at 300 USDT, providing a clear value anchor and downside protection for the asset.

“Cosmic Wheel” represents a milestone for Ourbit SuperCEX, successfully blending high-stakes trading, interactive tasks, and long-term equity through its multi-layered design. The combined structure of the Futures War, the Fortune Draw, and the ourbie NFT contributed to increased platform activity and liquidity, while offering users multiple avenues for engagement. As 2025 concludes, the campaign provides a reference point for future product development and user-focused initiatives at Ourbit.

As outlined in the article's abstract, central banks typically assess the “need” for a CBDC through the lens of their primary mandates, which are traditionally focused on monetary policy and financial stability. While central banks see themselves as serving society, this mandate-bound approach risks overlooking broader societal needs and consequences that fall outside their conventional scope. Lucien and Ross argue that these broader social effects should be given substantial weight and that decisions regarding a retail CBDC should involve collaboration between states, central banks, and diverse sources of expertise, along with meaningful public engagement. Importantly, they stress that a CBDC may not always be the appropriate solution.

Lucien explains why he and Ross felt compelled to write the article, what it contributes to the expanding CBDC literature, and why evaluating CBDC issuance primarily through a monetary policy framework is problematic. They emphasize that CBDC issuance can have society-wide implications and therefore should not be driven solely by central banks acting within their traditional mandates.

Lucien also carefully distinguishes between wholesale and retail CBDCs. He explains that wholesale CBDCs may offer meaningful efficiency gains in areas such as cross-border payments and capital market transactions and are accessible only to a limited group of market participants, such as commercial banks. By contrast, retail CBDCs are designed for use by the general public for everyday transactions, transfers, and payments. The article focuses squarely on retail CBDCs and the distinct policy questions they raise.

The conversation concludes with Lucien outlining the policy positions he and Ross advocate, reiterating that decisions about whether a retail CBDC is truly needed should involve multiple government agencies and broad public participation, rather than being driven exclusively by central banks.

Their article examines the regulatory challenges facing impact investing in the EU. As the abstract notes, sustainability-oriented investors want to pay for measurable impact rather than mere regulatory compliance. The authors argue that the current EU Sustainable Finance Framework (EUSFF) overemphasizes rule-based, ex ante definitions of sustainability, which focus on inputs rather than demonstrated outcomes. While this approach may raise capital costs for unsustainable firms within the EU, it has not delivered meaningful global environmental or social improvements and may even encourage capital to flow into less regulated markets, worsening outcomes overall.

Dirk and Marian advocate shifting EU financial regulation toward proven, ex post impact rather than adding new product categories. They propose five targeted reforms aimed at simplifying regulation, reducing reporting burdens, and mitigating “impact washing,” while aligning with developments in the UK and Switzerland.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will launch a new digital yuan framework on Jan. 1, letting commercial banks pay interest on holdings in a move to incentivize broader adoption of the central bank digital currency. 

The so-called ""action plan"" will shift the digital yuan (e-CNY) from its current role as digital cash to digital deposit money, Lu Lei, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, wrote in an article published by state newspaper Financial News.

""The future digital yuan will be a modern digital payment and circulation means issued and circulated within the financial system, with technical support and supervision provided by the central bank, possessing the attributes of commercial bank liabilities, based on accounts, compatible with distributed ledger technology, and having the functions of a measure of monetary value, store of value, and cross-border payment,"" Lei wrote. 

The plan also proposes to establish an international digital yuan operations centre in Shanghai.

The PBOC began working on the digital yuan program in 2014 under the name of the Digital Currency Electronic Payment or DCEP project to research benefits of the CBDC. 

The central bank launched the digital yuan in April 2022. Since then, it has airdropped e-CNY as part of a pilot program to encourage adoption.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Is this a turning point for crypto-friendly banking?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/blockchain-liquidity-management-smes","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 04:19:18 GMT","

Q: What is the significance of the Standard Chartered and Ant International collaboration?

A: The collaboration between Standard Chartered Bank and Ant International represents a notable shift in liquidity management for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With the launch of a blockchain-based tokenized deposit solution, they enable cross-currency fund transfers around the clock. This dramatically improves the efficiency of global enterprises. Ant's Whale platform, which combines banking capabilities with tokenization, makes it possible for businesses to access real-time treasury solutions. The introduction of this tokenized deposit system is a game changer, providing liquidity that is just-in-time. According to Mahesh Kini, Global Head of Cash Management at Standard Chartered, the demand for real-time, 24/7 treasury management is rapidly accelerating. This collaboration not only streamlines capital access but also meets the urgent requirements of SMEs in a fiercely competitive market.

Q: What are the risks associated with the blockchain adoption for SMEs?

A: While blockchain technology offers considerable advantages, the road to adoption is laden with risks and complexities for SMEs:

Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are infamous for their price swings, which can destabilize the liquidity of SMEs. Sudden market changes could lead to financial turmoil, necessitating careful management of exposure to digital assets.

Regulatory Complexities: The regulations governing blockchain technology differ greatly from one region to another. SMEs could find it challenging to ensure they comply with local laws, complicating the use of these solutions.

Liquidity Risks: Compared to traditional assets, blockchain assets may have poorer liquidity. This can complicate financing for SMEs, leading to barriers in accessing capital.

Implementation Issues: Implementing blockchain solutions can be both complex and resource-intensive. SMEs might need specialized talent to tackle the technical challenges involved.

Security Concerns: Vulnerabilities in smart contracts and hacking incidents could threaten asset safety. Robust security measures become essential for protecting digital assets.

Q: How can SMEs prepare for the shift towards blockchain solutions?

A: To successfully transition to blockchain solutions, SMEs should consider several strategies:

Hybrid Payments and Treasury Strategy: Keep traditional bank relationships for core services while testing blockchain solutions like stablecoins and tokenized deposits. This could lower costs and risks related to settlement.

Partner with Regulated Banks: Collaborating with established financial institutions ensures that SMEs can access compliant blockchain solutions, thereby reducing regulatory burdens and increasing security.

Utilize Regulated Stablecoins: Using stablecoins or bank-backed tokenized fiat for settlement can lessen the risks of unregulated cryptocurrencies, simplifying the compliance process.

Engage with Regulators: Early dialogues with regulatory bodies can help SMEs stay compliant with local licensing regimes.

Implement Controlled Pilots: Running small pilots with trustworthy vendors allows SMEs to confirm operational workflows and compliance measures before fully deploying their blockchain initiatives.

Invest in Staff Training: Building in-house expertise in digital asset mechanics and risk management is crucial for effectively leveraging blockchain technology.

Q: What are the implications for cross-border payments in the crypto space?

A: This collaboration carries weighty implications for cross-border payments, especially for crypto-friendly businesses:

Faster Bank-to-Wallet Transfers: Linking bank and wallet systems eliminates settlement friction, speeding up cross-border receipts and payouts for crypto enterprises.

Lower FX and Hedging Costs: AI-driven FX forecasting and automated liquidity management can reduce costs and volatility for multi-currency cryptocurrency firms.

Tokenization and Blockchain Cash Management: The creation of tokenized deposits allows for near-instantaneous movement of value, enhancing working capital efficiency across borders.

Greater Interoperability: The collaboration broadens payout options by connecting traditional banking systems with extensive wallet ecosystems, which enhances on-ramping and off-ramping paths for crypto enterprises.

Enhanced Compliance and Traceability: Stronger audit trails and KYC/AML integration paths are provided, assisting institutional clients in meeting regulatory expectations when moving fiat to and from wallets.

A pivotal moment unfolds with the partnership between Standard Chartered and Ant International, showcasing the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize liquidity management for SMEs. While the advantages are striking, the potential challenges and complexities are equally present.  Moreover, by formulating a strategic approach—fostering partnerships with regulated banks, employing stablecoins, and actively engaging with regulators—SMEs can secure their footing amid the evolving digital banking landscape. The future of liquidity management appears promising for those prepared to embrace change, as blockchain continues to reshape finance.

The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act proposes a 5% levy on wealth over $1B, including unrealized gains, raising concerns for startup founders and crypto investors.

Crypto and tech leaders warn California's wealth tax could drive founders, capital, and innovation out of the state amid fears of illiquid asset taxation.

California's proposed billionaire wealth tax is quickly becoming a major flashpoint for the cryptocurrency and technology sectors. While state leaders say the policy will help fund public services, critics argue it could weaken the startup and innovation economy that helped make California a global powerhouse.

The core issue, according to industry leaders, is that the tax misunderstands how modern wealth is created, particularly in crypto companies, startups, and venture-backed businesses, where most wealth exists on paper rather than in cash.

The proposal, officially titled the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, would introduce a 5% tax on net wealth above $1 billion. The revenue would be directed toward healthcare and social programs.

What sets this plan apart is its inclusion of unrealized gains, meaning individuals could be taxed on assets they have not sold. This includes private company equity, startup shares, and long-term crypto holdings, assets that are often illiquid and difficult to convert into cash.

Supporters say the tax ensures the ultra-wealthy contribute more. Critics say it creates financial pressure for founders whose wealth is tied to business ownership rather than income.

The unrealized gains tax has drawn the strongest criticism from founders and crypto leaders. Many startup founders take modest salaries and rely on equity for long-term value. When a company's valuation increases, a founder can suddenly be classified as a billionaire without receiving any actual money.

This situation, critics argue, forces founders to make difficult choices, including selling equity early or taking on personal debt just to meet tax obligations. Over time, this uncertainty may discourage long-term innovation and risk-taking, especially in emerging sectors like blockchain and crypto.

Several industry leaders, including Hunter Horsley, Nic Carter, and Jesse Powell, have warned that the tax could accelerate capital flight from California. Their concern goes beyond individual relocation.

They argue that startups, venture capital firms, skilled workers, and philanthropic investment could gradually shift to regions with more predictable tax environments. In a digital-first economy, capital and talent are highly mobile, and policy signals play a major role in where innovation settles.

Chamath Palihapitiya has been one of the most outspoken critics of the proposal. He argues that the tax is not gradual but an immediate 5% charge on total wealth, which can create serious cash-flow problems for founders.

In some cases, founders could owe tens of millions of dollars based on short-term valuations, even though their assets remain illiquid. If those valuations later fall, the tax liability may still stand, leaving founders financially exposed.

Analysts say this structure is deeply flawed, as established billionaires often have the resources to manage the impact, while younger founders building new companies face the greatest risk.

For the crypto sector, the debate goes beyond taxation. It reflects a growing gap between policymakers and innovation-driven industries. Crypto leaders worry that policies targeting paper wealth could discourage builders at a time when global competition for talent and capital is intensifying.

The concern is not about avoiding taxes. It is about designing rules that do not penalize innovation before it turns into real economic value.

Founders with wealth tied to equity may owe large taxes without cash, forcing early share sales or debt and increasing financial risk.

Industry leaders warn unpredictable taxes may drive founders, investors, and companies to states with more stable, innovation-friendly policies.

The 5% tax on billionaires' wealth in California has erupted into sharp warnings this week, with prominent figures from both the tech and crypto sectors, such as Larry Page, Peter Thiel, and David Sacks, threatening to relocate if the proposed tax model is approved. 

The ballot initiative, California's proposed 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, would impose a one-time 5% tax on net wealth above $1 billion, including unrealized gains on paper assets. This initiative is to help fund the state services, such as the healthcare sector. However, according to the opponents of the law, this strategy could trigger an exodus of high-net-worth residents, cause disruptions in the local investments and innovations, and force equity sales to cover tax liabilities. 

The proposal received heavy backlash and public criticism from executives and founders across the technology and crypto industries. Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell tweeted how this tax could be “the final straw”, suggesting the relocation of billionaires if this measure is realized. 

A 5% theft of unrealized gains and assets taxes were already paid on is about the most retarded thing I've ever heard. I promise you this will be the final straw. Billionaires will take with them all of their spending, hobbies, philanthropy and jobs. Solve the waste/fraud issue. https://t.co/DKcNWni2kB

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley posted on X how the application to unrealized gains could force the billionaire residents to sell their stakes or assets to meet tax liabilities, which can, in turn, disrupt the investment and business growth.  

<2 years ago Ro was pushing against the policy he's advocating for today. Nothing about the policy logic changed. This is the thing about politicians of this era —Their words mean little. While the typical person speaks when they have robust conviction, politicians of this… https://t.co/h4HAHCvZyq

Palmer Luckey, cofounder of Anduril, a defense technology firm, publicly denounced the proposal, stating it could compel founders to sell large shares of their companies to pay the bill, while other prominent billionaires warned that the tax might be an “organized government seizure of private property.”

Adding to the pressure around the topic, reports suggested that billionaires Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist, and Larry Page, co-founder of Google, are planning to relocate from California if the tax model is moved forward. 

Billionaire Bill Ackman said California is on a path to “self-destruction” if the tax act moves forward. He posted on X (formerly Twitter) that “Hollywood is already toast, and now the most productive entrepreneurs will leave, taking their tax revenues and job creation elsewhere. 

US Representative Ro Khanna defended the bill, saying that this act could help in the betterment of California's economy, including sectors such as childcare, housing, and education. 

My district is $18 trillion, nearly 1/3 of US stock market in a 50 mile radius. We have 5 companies with a market cap over a trillion dollar companies. If I can stand up for a billionaire tax, this is not a hard position for 434 other members or 100 Senators.Those saying that… https://t.co/k7j4TvJARK

He mocked Peter Thiel and Larry Page as they consider leaving California if the tax bill is implemented, saying that he will miss them very much. 

As Ro Khanna received tremendous criticism and was accused of “scaring away billionaires”, he counter-argued that “We cannot have a nation with extreme concentration of wealth in a few places, but where 70% of Americans believe the American dream is dead and healthcare, childcare, housing, and education are unaffordable. What will stifle American innovation, what will make us fall behind China, is if we see further political dysfunction and social unrest, if we fail to cultivate the talent in every American and in every city and town.”

“Those saying that we wouldn't have a future NVIDIA in the Bay if this tax goes into effect are glossing over Silicon Valley history. Jensen was at LSI Logic, and his co-founders were at Sun. He started NVIDIA in my district because of the semiconductor talent, Stanford, innovation networks, and venture funding.”

Beyond the threats to individual relocation, venture capital figures and startup founders have also voiced their concerns about the dampened entrepreneurship in the state if the tax bill is passed. 

Chamath Palihapitiya warned the tax would “kill entrepreneurship in California,” arguing that “founders whose wealth is tied up in illiquid equity could be forced into untenable cash demands just to cover the levy.”

Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian criticized the idea of taxing unrealized gains altogether, calling it the “wrong answer” to addressing the wealth gap and cautioning that it could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of the state.

Even *David Sacks, a prominent tech executive and White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, shared on social media that  “5 % across-the-board confiscation of net worth,” hinting that he may reconsider his own California residency in response.

The debate moved further, to the inequality and fiscal policy in one of the US's most economically progressive states. While the Republicans and the businessmen warn the state about the disadvantages of passing the bill, proponents continue to argue that the wealthy can and should contribute more to society. 

Gavin Newsom, California's Governor, has stressed the importance of addressing systemic inequalities without undermining the state's economic contributors. 

For the bill to qualify for the 2026 ballot, the initiative should collect around 875,000 signatures. Upon fulfilling the conditions, the issue could either make or break the state's economy, defining a political flashpoint. Implementation of the tax act could push some of the world's wealthiest businessmen to leave the state.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) said its combined crypto, cash and higher-risk “moonshot” investments have reached $13.2 billion, driven by an ether ETH$2,940.97 position that now totals more than 4.1 million tokens.

The firm in a Monday press release said the holdings make it the world's largest publicly owned ether treasury and place it second globally among corporate crypto treasuries, behind bitcoin-only Strategy (MSTR).

As of Dec. 28, Bitmine said it held 4,110,525 ETH, along with 192 bitcoin, a $23 million stake in Eightco Holdings and $1 billion in cash. 

The ether position represents about 3.41% of the network's circulating supply of roughly 120.7 million ETH, putting the company about two-thirds of the way toward what it calls its “alchemy of 5%” target.

""We continue to be the largest 'fresh money' buyer of ETH in the world,"" said Thomas Lee, chairman of Bitminee.

""Year-end tax-loss related selling is pushing down crypto and crypto equity prices and this effect tends to be the greatest from 12/26 to 12/30, so we are navigating markets with this in mind,"" he added.

Bitmine said it has currently staked 408,627 ETH, worth about $1.2 billion, and is working with three staking providers as it prepares to launch its Made in America Validator Network, or MAVAN, in early 2026. 

Using the current composite Ethereum staking rate of 2.81%, Lee estimated that fully staking the company's ether holdings could generate roughly $374 million in annual staking revenue.

The company also released a special chairman's message ahead of its annual shareholder meeting on Jan. 15, 2026, at the Wynn Las Vegas, urging investors to vote in favor of four proposals tied to its long-term strategy.

Ether was trading little-changed over the past 24 hours around $2,950 at publication time.

Bitcoin BTC$89,558.82 whales, or holders with at least 1,000 BTC, have been the dominant buyers since the price of the largest cryptocurrency bottomed near $80,000 at the end of November, according to Glassnode data. They remain the strongest accumulators as bitcoin trades just below $90,000.

According to Glassnode data, the 1,000-10,000 BTC cohort is the only group showing sustained accumulation, with an Accumulation Trend Score close to 1. 

The metric breaks down buying and selling behavior across wallet cohorts, measuring both the size of entities and the net amount of bitcoin they have acquired over the past 15 days. A score closer to 1 indicates accumulation, while a score closer to 0 signals distribution. 

The data suggests that large holders have been accumulating bitcoin in the $80,000 range, a price level bitcoin has not traded in for an extended period compared with other price buckets. 

This behavior contrasts sharply with smaller holders, all of whom show varying degrees of distribution. 

Given that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has remained in ""fear"" or ""extreme fear"" for roughly the past 30 days, this selling pressure from smaller entities likely reflects capitulation. 

Meanwhile, the 10,000-plus BTC whale cohort was aggressively buying when bitcoin traded near $80,000 in late November, though they have begun to slow over recent weeks. Still, as a cohort they are not yet selling, which was the dominant behavior the the BTC price topped $100,000 around mid-year.

Sberbank, Russia's second-largest bank, issued the country's first bitcoin-backed loan to one of its largest bitcoin miners, calling the transaction a pilot and suggesting it was keen to issue more in the future

“We believe this product will be relevant not only for cryptocurrency miners, but also for companies that own cryptocurrencies,” the bank said in a statement. It did not disclose the loan amount.

The bank said it used its own crypto custody product, Rutoken, to hold the bitcoin used as collateral for the crypto loan. “The loan was secured by digital currency mined by [Intelion Data]. This guarantees the assets' safety during the loan period,” Sberbank said.

According to RBC Crypto, IntelionData CEO Timofey Semenov said the loan is an important practical example for the industry and an indicator that the market is reaching a new level, which, if proven effective, could be scaled up and used in the Russian mining industry.

Anatoly Popov, Sberbank's deputy chairman, said the bank already offers clients structured bonds and digital financial assets with investments in bitcoin, ether ETH$2,940.97 and cryptocurrency baskets, the Russian news outlet added.

Russia Quietly Changed Its Space Station Plans. Here's What That Means

The proposed Russian Orbital Station will stick to a familiar path instead of an ambitious polar orbit

The International Space Station (ISS) is due to close down by 2030, and Russia, one of its main partners, is designing its own replacement orbital laboratory. After a decade of planning to place its future space station into a high-latitude polar orbit for Arctic observation, Russian authorities have changed their minds. Instead the Russians have decided to stick with the familiar ISS orbit—the same 51.6-degree inclination used by the Soviet Mir space station nearly 40 years ago.

The decision goes beyond a routine adjustment to flight plans. It will shape the architecture of Russia's space program for decades to come, determining the type of modules used to build the Russian Orbital Station (ROS), the launch vehicles and spaceports that will be used, and the structure of the country's future space economy. Roscosmos officials did not respond to a request for comment.

The head of Roscosmos framed the shift as a step toward future space cooperation with India. “We are building our own national orbital station, and India is building its own,” Roscosmos general director Dmitry Bakanov said during a visit to New Delhi, according to Russian news source RBC. India has announced plans to launch the first part of its Bharatiya Antariksh Station in 2028. “We are negotiating to place them in the same orbital plane.”

Experts, however, are skeptical that alignment with India played more than a rhetorical role. “This decision is entirely understandable given the political and economic realities, says Dmitry Payson, a member of the International Academy of Astronautics, who was formerly associated with the Russian space sector. Placing the future station in the same orbit as the ISS is far less expensive, and requires fewer manufacturing and design innovations, than aiming for a polar orbit. “Compatibility with India in terms of inclination became a conveniently timed additional justification for a decision driven by different considerations,” Payson says.

Sticking with the same orbit will allow Roscosmos to reuse designs and technology from ISS and its existing Soyuz spacecraft, he adds. The result is a station architecture that looks less like a step forward than a return nearly 40 years back to the Mir era.

A polar orbit that passes over both of Earth's poles remains a rarity in human spaceflight. So far, the only crewed mission to reach such an orbit was the privately funded Fram2 flight on the SpaceX Dragon capsule in April 2025.

In December 2014 Oleg Ostapenko, then head of Roscosmos, said the agency was considering a high-latitude station that would allow observation of most of Russia's territory and could potentially serve as a staging ground for future lunar missions.

Early concepts also envisioned a suite of novel components, including the OKA-T autonomous module for ultrasensitive materials science experiments and an expandable module—Russia's counterpart to the ISS's BEAM—equipped with a centrifuge. The station was repeatedly described as a test bed for prospective elements of lunar infrastructure.

By 2021 much of that future-facing vision had faded. Officials decided to orient the station around the Science Power Module (NEM), whose hull was already sitting on the factory floor of Russian aerospace manufacturer RKK Energia. Originally planned for the ISS to reduce the Russian segment's dependence on U.S. power, but still incomplete, NEM was a problematic choice as the core of an independent station.

The module lacked control moment gyros for attitude control and had only a single docking port, leaving no place for a cargo spacecraft to attach while a crew was on board. Additional docking hardware and follow-on modules would have to be sent up before even a minimal crew could visit.

The module would also have needed extensive reworking, including the addition of basic crew systems such as a toilet and a main computer, to turn what was essentially a power plant and laboratory into a functional control center and living space.

Launch plans only compounded the problem. NEM was to be sent into a polar orbit aboard the Angara-A5M rocket—a variant that has yet to fly—from the Vostochny Cosmodrome, which at the time lacked a launch pad for Angara.

These constraints ultimately pushed the polar orbit station project to a dead end, says military and space analyst Pavel Luzin, a senior fellow at the Saratoga Foundation. “NEM appears impossible to redesign into the core of a future station,” Luzin says. “Even if basic crew systems can be added, there would be little room left for scientific payloads—it would essentially become an enlarged spacecraft.”

The switch to a 51.6-degree orbit resolved many of the project's challenges. The new station gets a starter module for free—one of the components of the Russian segment of ISS, called the MLM Nauka module, which is already in orbit and fully equipped for a crew. And there would be no need to upgrade the Vostochny launch pad because crewed launches could rely on proven Soyuz spacecraft from the fully equipped Baikonur Cosmodrome. NEM would retain its original role as a science-and-power module and could be launched aboard the reliable Proton-M rocket.

Plans to deploy the rest of the station are detailed in internal RKK Energia documents obtained by Scientific American. The sequence begins with the controlled deorbit of the “UM” docking and utility node module from Nauka. In late 2028 a nearly identical Universal Node Module (UUM) will be launched from Baikonur and attached to Nauka. At the same time, the ISS will be gradually lowering its orbit for its planned crash into the Pacific Ocean.

In 2029 NEM will be launched aboard a Proton rocket from Baikonur and docked to the UUM's lower port. An airlock module, ShM, will follow in 2030, attaching to the side port.

Once assembled, the ROS will detach from the rest of ISS, which will have served as a building berth for its Russian “successor.” The new Russian station will then fly independently, with its attitude and orbit controlled by two specially modified Progress cargo spacecraft docked for that purpose.

Even these streamlined plans, however, will require substantial work to make the ROS operate independently. The relatively new Nauka module, launched in 2021, already needs repairs, including a fix to its leaking cooling system. All tasks must be completed before June 2030, when the ISS is expected to begin a rapid descent. There may be a gap before Russian cosmonauts can visit the new station.

“I believe Russia faces, at the very least, a hiatus in its crewed spaceflight program,” Luzin says. “Although it has long sought partners to join the ROS project, no visible progress has been made.”

The material might just revolutionize modern manufacturing.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In recently published research, scientists have revealed a special alloy that could change the game with its combination of temperature tolerance, resistance to wear, and previously unheard of fracture toughness. 

How do you make one alloy that has it all? The secret is a feature called a kink band, where the material naturally forms a certain way as it is heated and treated. As the saying goes, sometimes our flaws can lead to our greatest strengths. Turns out that's also true for exotic alloys. 

Many metals are soft in their pure form—or, at least, softer than we'd like them to be for applications like manufacturing and heavy machinery. Long ago, humans realized they could combine two metals into one alloy (like bronze) and get results that were tougher, held a sharp edge better, and lasted longer.

Why are alloys so strong? Well, each element has its own atomic mass and particle size. Think about a pure metal like a game of Jenga. When you push on a block (or deform your metal), you know how that block is going to move. But in an alloy, your Jenga tower is built from blocks of different sizes, meaning it's much harder to simply “push” (deform) them out of place. There are fewer of the neat lines that are prone to breakage.

In this paper, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a handful of west coast universities collaborated on a new refractory alloy. Refractory—used colloquially to mean stubborn—in this case means an alloy that is extremely tolerant of very high heat. They're made by combining metals from the fifth and sixth period of the periodic table of elements: molybdenum, niobium, tungsten, tangalum, and rhenium.

These elements have some of the highest melting points in the known periodic table. They also have very high hardness among the pure metals—although if we're talking about materials in general, diamond still leaves them in the dust. That means when alloyed in a particular way, these metals (along with a few others with high melting points, like titanium and iridium) can become even more resistant to heat and wear, forming the family of refractory alloys.

There's just a few problems. The same toughness and hardness that defines the refractory alloys often means they're literally too hard to work with, with low ductility and a high likelihood of fracture. In other words, if you're trying to metalwork a refractory alloy into any kind of shape, it will break instead of bend. We needed to find a middle ground where a very hard refractory alloy could take a hit and deform in the desired way rather than fracturing.

To do this, the Berkeley Lab scientists “specifically engineered” an alloy of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium, and formed kink bands in the metal. Inside a solid material like an alloy, kinks and jogs are terms referring to types of flaws that affect the alloy's structure. Their details are more scientific, but a kink in a power cable or a street that jogs over a bit give you the intuitive idea. While the alloy forms, its crystal structures move around just enough to create these “stretch marks” or seams that show a change in crystal orientation.

In cables, a kink is often a sign of damage or unusual wear. In the crystals that we use as gemstones, a kink band might ruin the desired sparkly effect by disrupting how light passes through the material. But in the alloy, researchers found that the kink bands resulted from dislocation tolerance—meaning deformability without breaking. The particles in the alloy were able to adapt to a space where the crystals had shifted around, and those bands of adaptation made the results stronger.

“Our work shows that contrary to conventional understanding, complex concentrated refractory alloys can possess exceptional fracture toughness across extreme temperature ranges, even in the cryogenic regime,” the scientists conclude. The next step is more research, since this is just one exploratory paper. 

But in a world waiting on new technologies like quantum computing and nuclear fusion, the cryogenic regime—where materials are cooled to near absolute zero—is vital. The stronger we can make those materials, the better.

Excavations indicated that the wall was deliberately and systematically removed, leading to additional questions as to who was responsible.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Tucked under one of the most historic complexes in all of Jerusalem, archaeologists discovered the largest section yet of the city's “First Wall,” dating to the time of the Hasmoneans (or Maccabees). 

“The newly uncovered section, known in ancient historical sources as the ‘First Wall,' is particularly impressive in both its size and its degree of preservation,” Amit Re'im and Marion Zindel, excavation directors for the Israel Antiquities Authority, wrote in a statement. “The wall is meticulously built of large, heavy stones, with a chiseled boss typical of this period.”

The 131-foot-long section of the ancient city wall, located beneath the historic Kishle prison complex, is the largest and most well-preserved of any section of the First Wall ever discovered. Originally built in the late second century B.C.E., the wall once stood more than 30 feet tall. 

Located nearby the Tower of David Jerusalem Museum, which dates to King Herod's time, this wall would have also surrounded Mount Zion during the second temple period. Details of the wall are preserved through historical accounts—Josephus, a first century C.E. historian who chronicled its route and gates, called it “impregnable.” That said, just because it was called the First Wall, doesn't make it so: Josephus also noted an old wall that may have been built by David and Solomon around the 10th century B.C.E. 

This First Wall's impressively robust 16 feet of thickness was found intact, but its current height indicates that the wall was systematically and deliberately dismantled.  

“There is much more to this wall than meets the eye,” Re'im and Zindel wrote. “It is clear that it was systematically destroyed and razed to the ground. This is predetermined destruction—not the result of the ravages of time, nor of a random enemy attack, but a deliberate execution of a well-planned action. This raised questions about who was responsible for the wall's destruction.” 

The scholars offer two theories. One hypothesis presents the idea that the Hasmoneans themselves eliminated the wall as part of an agreement with Antiochus VII Sidetes. This Antiochus, an heir of the Antiochus known from the Hanukkah stories, required that fortification of the city removed as part of a peace agreement reached by the Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus I. This may have necessitated the dismantling of the First Wall. 

During the 1980s, excavations near the site of the new discovery uncovered a large Hellenistic-period cache of hundreds of catapult stones, arrowheads, slingshots, and lead bullets. The Israel Antiquities Authority calls this clear evidence of a siege by Antiochus VII, even if the stash discovered was blocked by the wall at the time. 

But there is a second theory of destruction—one that rests the blame on King Herod. The Roman-appointed ruler was well-known for destroying Jewish buildings in his bid to become a king over the Jews, and systematically removing the First Wall would have fit with his intentions, according to Re'im and Zindel. 

“This segment of Jerusalem's ancient city wall uncovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority is tangible and moving evidence of Jerusalem's might and stature during the Hasmonean period,” Amichai Eliyahu, Israeli minister of heritage, said in a statement. “The archaeological discoveries allow us to connect to the historical continuity that binds us—generations of Jews, to Jerusalem, and demonstrates and exhibits our proud heritage to the world. It is exciting to see how the stories of Hanukkah are coming to life on the ground.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","ADHD drugs don't work the way we thought","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251225235942.htm","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:41:29 GMT","

Prescription stimulant drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall are commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including among children. In the United States, an estimated 3.5 million children ages 3 to 17 take medication for ADHD. That number has risen as diagnoses of the neurodevelopmental disorder have become more common.

For decades, stimulant medications have been thought to work by directly influencing brain regions responsible for attention. New research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis calls that explanation into question. The study was led by Benjamin Kay, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology, and Nico U. Dosenbach, MD, PhD, the David M. & Tracy S. Holtzman Professor of Neurology. Their findings suggest that these medications primarily affect brain systems involved in reward and wakefulness rather than the networks traditionally linked to attention.

Published Dec. 24 in Cell, the study indicates that stimulants may improve performance by making people with ADHD feel more alert and more interested in what they are doing. Instead of directly sharpening focus, the drugs appear to increase engagement with tasks. The researchers also observed brain activity patterns that resembled the effects of a good night's sleep, counteracting the typical brain changes associated with sleep deprivation.

""I prescribe a lot of stimulants as a child neurologist, and I've always been taught that they facilitate attention systems to give people more voluntary control over what they pay attention to,"" said Kay, who treats patients at St. Louis Children's Hospital. ""But we've shown that's not the case. Rather, the improvement we observe in attention is a secondary effect of a child being more alert and finding a task more rewarding, which naturally helps them pay more attention to it.""

Kay said the results emphasize the need to consider sleep quality alongside medication when children are being evaluated for ADHD.

Brain imaging reveals unexpected patterns

To examine how stimulants affect the brain, the researchers analyzed resting state functional MRI, or fMRI, data from 5,795 children ages 8 to 11 who took part in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Resting state fMRI measures brain activity when a person is not performing a specific task. The ABCD study is a long term, multisite project following the brain development of more than 11,000 children across the U.S., including a site at WashU Medicine.

The team compared brain connectivity in children who took prescription stimulants on the day of their scan with those who did not. Children who had taken stimulants showed stronger activity in brain regions associated with arousal and wakefulness, as well as areas involved in predicting how rewarding an activity might be. In contrast, the scans did not show notable increases in regions classically tied to attention.

Adult experiment confirms the findings

The researchers tested their results in a smaller study involving five healthy adults without ADHD who did not normally take stimulant medications. Each participant underwent resting state fMRI scans before and after taking a stimulant dose. This allowed the team to precisely track changes in brain connectivity. Once again, the medications activated reward and arousal networks rather than attention networks.

""Essentially, we found that stimulants pre-reward our brains and allow us to keep working at things that wouldn't normally hold our interest -- like our least favorite class in school, for example,"" Dosenbach said. He explained that instead of directly activating attention centers, stimulants make tasks that are usually difficult to focus on feel more rewarding. That increased sense of reward can help children stick with both challenging and repetitive activities.

""These results also provide a potential explanation for how stimulants treat hyperactivity, which previously seemed paradoxical,"" Dosenbach added. ""Whatever kids can't focus on -- those tasks that make them fidgety -- are tasks that they find unrewarding. On a stimulant, they can sit still better because they're not getting up to find something better to do.""

ADHD treatment, sleep, and performance

Within the ABCD study, children with ADHD who were taking stimulant medications had higher school grades, according to parent reports, and performed better on cognitive tests than children with ADHD who were not taking stimulants. The largest improvements were seen in children with more severe ADHD symptoms.

However, the benefits were not observed in every child. Among participants who slept less than the recommended nine or more hours per night, those who took stimulants earned better grades than sleep deprived children who did not take the medication. In contrast, stimulants were not linked to improved performance in neurotypical children who were getting enough sleep. (It is not clear why these kids were taking stimulant medications.) Overall, the link between stimulants and improved cognitive performance appeared only in children with ADHD or in those who were not getting sufficient sleep.

""We saw that if a participant didn't sleep enough, but they took a stimulant, the brain signature of insufficient sleep was erased, as were the associated behavioral and cognitive decrements,"" Dosenbach said.

Potential risks of masking sleep deprivation

The researchers cautioned that better performance despite poor sleep may come with long term consequences.

""Not getting enough sleep is always bad for you, and it's especially bad for kids,"" Kay said. He noted that children who are overtired can show symptoms that resemble ADHD, including difficulty paying attention in class or declining grades. In some cases, this could lead to a misdiagnosis when sleep deprivation is the underlying issue. Stimulant medications may appear to help by imitating some effects of adequate sleep, while still leaving children exposed to the long term harms of chronic sleep loss. Kay urged clinicians to consider sleep deprivation during ADHD evaluations and to explore ways to improve sleep.

Questions that remain

Dosenbach and Kay said their findings highlight the need for further research into the long term effects of stimulant use on the brain. They noted that stimulants might have a restorative role by activating the brain's waste clearing system during wakefulness. At the same time, the medications could potentially cause lasting harm if they are used to compensate for ongoing sleep deficits.

The differentiation potency of cells is governed by dynamic changes in gene expression, which can be inferred from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. While velocity-based approaches have been used to analyze cell state changes as vector fields, extracting acceleration (change of change) information remains challenging because of the sparsity and high-dimensionality of the data. Here, we develop ddHodge, a framework based on Hodge decomposition for precise vector-field reconstruction. ddHodge accurately recovers all basic components of the vector field, namely, the gradient, curl, and divergence, including the acceleration of the cell state, as second-order derivatives, even from biased and sparse samples. Furthermore, we extend the method to approximate high-dimensional gene expression dynamics on lower-dimensional data manifolds. By applying ddHodge to scRNA-seq data from mouse embryogenesis, we reveal that the gene expression dynamics during development follow a gradient system shaped by potential landscapes, which has not previously been validated with real data. Furthermore, we quantify differentiation potency as cell state stability on the basis of the divergence and identify key genes that drive potency. Our general computational framework for analyzing complex biological systems can elucidate cell fate decisions in developmental processes.

The dynamics of cell states, namely, the temporal changes in cell states, underpin all biological phenomena, including development, regeneration, differentiation, and pathology. One of the primary goals of life sciences is to understand these cell state dynamics. However, these dynamics represent a high-dimensional, multibody system involving interactions among tens of thousands of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid molecules, constituting a complex, nonequilibrium system1,2. Consequently, traditional hypothesis-driven approaches have focused on small subsystems formed by the interactions among the molecules of interest, creating building blocks for understanding the whole system. Recent advancements in single-cell omics3,4,5,6 have enabled comprehensive evaluations of cell states represented by all gene expression profiles, which could allow a data-driven understanding of complex cell state dynamics. However, single-cell measurement techniques are invasive, and the resulting data are static, lacking temporal changes for each cell. Therefore, pseudotime analysis techniques7,8,9 have been employed to construct temporal information based on of large-scale static snapshot data to analyze gene expression dynamics. Nevertheless, conventional pseudotime analysis methods provide only an order of time, and the speed and acceleration/deceleration cannot be evaluated, making it challenging to analyze detailed dynamics, including the stability of states that represent sensitivity of gene expression responses to perturbations, as well as more diverse types of state changes.

Therefore, RNA velocity10,11 has frequently been used to trace changes in cell states as trajectories in gene expression space by utilizing the time derivative of the gene expression (velocity) of each cell. Based on this time-derivative inference approach involving gene expression data, methods for reverse engineering these dynamics (vector-field reconstruction) have been proposed, allowing analyses of the interactions among genes that drive local dynamics and the least action paths of the cell state12. However, owing to the lack of a sufficient theoretical foundation to ensure accurate reconstruction of vector fields on the basis of high-dimensional data, a methodology for precisely reconstructing cell state dynamics, appropriately summarizing the dynamics occurring in high-dimensional space, and evaluating the stability of each cell state has yet to be developed.

Here, we developed a high-dimensional dynamics analysis framework called ddHodge. Our framework is based on the mathematical theorem of Hodge decomposition, which provides the three fundamental components of vector fields on manifolds13,14. ddHodge offers a unified perspective on the problem of high-dimensional vector-field reconstruction on manifold and provides a practical method to precisely reconstruct dynamics in unprecedented detail. Through simulations and validation using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we demonstrated that ddHodge can provide a summary of the overall unknown high-dimensional dynamics and identify genes associated with fate determination by affecting the stability of cell states.

The cell states represented by each data point are generated from an unknown differential equation system F(x, y) (Fig. 1A, left). These states are pairs of observed positions (x, y) and their corresponding velocities F(x, y). Each velocity is given as the gradient of an unknown potential function U. The magnitude of the potential value at each point reflects the temporal ordering of the cell states (Fig. 1A, middle). The convex region in the potential landscape, indicates the stability of states that are diversifying; branching is likely to occur, and the concave region is considered to be converged; the cell states adopt specific lineages (Fig. 1A, right). Therefore, the shape of the potential landscape is a critical indicator of dynamics. Here, we used a 2D gradient system as an illustrative example to explain the interpretation of potential. Note that gradient systems are the special cases where vector fields are represented solely by the gradients of a scalar function, and only the potential determines the dynamics. Generally, dynamics are non-gradient systems.

A Shape of the landscape: The local shape of the landscape represents the local dynamics of cell states. The underlying dynamics of the cell state generates single-cell data (left), and the dynamics are represented by a potential landscape (middle). The shape of the landscape indicates the type of change in the cell state, such as diversification or convergence (right). A negative divergence (concave shape) indicates a stable state change in which velocities converge toward the center. A positive divergence (convex shape) indicates an unstable state change in which the cell state trajectories become more diverse. A divergence of zero (flat shape) indicates a change that occurs at a constant speed (i.e., no acceleration or deceleration). B Complex dynamics in high-dimensional space (left) contain both rotational and gradient components, shown here, consist of spiral source (S1) and sink (S2) components. After sampling scRNA-seq data, conventional approaches using nonlinear dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and velocity embedding lose geometric information, distorting the original dynamics. The split-and-conquer strategy of ddHodge better represents the resulting 2D representation. This manifold-aware approach maintains the integrity of the original dynamical structure. C ddHodge strategy: Reconstruct dynamics in the low-dimensional tangent space patches and combine these patches smoothly. The low-dimensional tangent spaces at each data point are estimated using a local PCA approach. A complete description of the vector field (components of Hodge decomposition: grad, div, and curl) is reconstructed smoothly along the near-parallel coordinate system designed in the curved space of the data manifold (the details are provided in the Methods). D ddHodge provides rich information about high-dimensional dynamics: the stability of states (Divergence), the best section to visualize (Schur vector), and the changes of involved genes (Grassmann).

Reconstructing cell state dynamics after nonlinear dimensionality reduction involving data deformation is a considerably difficult problem15,16,17. Nevertheless, nonlinear dimensionality reduction is useful for visualization. We set the original high-dimensional (3D) dynamical system to have a region of instability (S1) with a large positive divergence and a region of stability (S2) with a large negative divergence (Fig. 1B, left). However, in commonly used nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP18, the density of the data points in original space is equalized in the reduced space; as a result, geometric features such as length and volume are lost. This deformation affects the landscape shape, making it difficult to identify regions S1 and S2 existed in the original space (Fig. 1B, right). Additionally, the velocity embedding approach10,15 used for visualizing velocity information can misrepresent dynamics by embedding high-dimensional velocity data with neighboring data points in the reduced space, potentially presenting nonexistent closed trajectories at the data boundaries. Hu et al. also showed that trajectories on cylindrical manifolds—formed by combining circular cell cycles trajectory with straight path trajectory—lose essential geometric information under nonlinear dimensionality reduction, which makes appropriate dynamical interpretation difficult19.

To address the challenge of reconstructing high-dimensional dynamics, we propose a combination of two approaches. First, we introduce a high-precision vector-field reconstruction method based on Hodge decomposition. A vector field on a manifold can be decomposed into three independent components: a gradient with divergence, a divergence-free rotational component, and a harmonic component as the residual (Hodge decomposition). The goal is to completely reconstruct these three components. Next, to make this method applicable in high-dimensional spaces, we consider approximating the Hodge components on a low-dimensional manifold (Fig. 1C; dimensionality reduction preserving data geometry). By using local principal component analysis (PCA) to approximate tangent spaces20 and patchworking these spaces, we build a low-dimensional curved space embedded in the high-dimensional space (hereafter referred to as the data manifold) (Fig. 1C, left). During the reconstruction process, we smooth the estimated values along the curved axes on the data manifold to compensate for noise and sample size limitations (Fig. 1C, top), enabling the reconstruction of the potential, divergence, and curl in high dimensions (Fig. 1C, bottom).

We implemented this framework as ddHodge.

ddHodge allows us to evaluate the temporal order and stability of data points on the basis of the potential and divergence, respectively. The periodic and oscillatory behavior of dynamic processes, such as the cell cycle and circadian rhythms, can be evaluated using the curl and harmonic components, independent of the gradient component. Even after dimensionality reduction, the Grassmann distance (the degree of bending when tangent spaces are patchworked) allows us to identify the timing of significant changes of dimensions (genes). The Jacobian matrix reconstructed on the data manifold can be used to select cross-sections of the gene expression space via Schur decomposition, where the trajectories undergo significant changes. By extracting and visualizing these rich dynamic indicators (Fig. 1D), we can identify genes associated with the diversification and convergence of dynamic cell states.

We evaluated the performance of ddHodge with synthetic data (Fig. 2). The evaluation metric was the mean squared error (MSE) between the theoretical values of the predefined potential U(x, y) and the reconstructed values. Additionally, we assessed the ability of ddHodge to reconstruct the shape of the potential landscape (divergence) and compared it with that of conventional methods.

A Workflow of the simulation validation approach. We used the nonlinear system F(x, y), which is completely determined by the gradient of a predefined potential U(x, y) in a low-dimensional flat plane (2D Euclidean space) (left). The initial values were set around the highest potential peak (2nd to 3rd panels). Using 100 data points sampled after random time intervals from 0 to 4 seconds (3rd to 4th panels), the potential values were reconstructed (right). B Recovering the shape of the landscape: The local shape of the landscape (Hessian matrix of U) can be recovered from the 2nd derivative of the piecewise quadratic functions fitted along the paths of the points to the k-nearest neighbors. These two landscapes (middle column, top and bottom rows) have different shapes with the same potential values. The flat shape with zero divergence (top-right) indicates constant changes of states, whereas the bumpy shape with large positive and negative divergence (bottom-right) indicates unstable states. C Comparison with the DEC method in terms of the divergence reconstruction performance: DEC with Delaunay triangular mesh vs. ddHodge with a k-NN graph. The yellow arrowheads at the sampling boundaries indicate the marked difference in the divergence estimated by the DEC and ddHodge methods. D Direct comparison of the performance of the two methods: The x-axis is the predicted value of the divergence by the DEC and ddHodge methods. The y-axis is the analytical (true) divergence of F(x, y). The yellow marker indicates the estimated values at the arrowhead on the left side of Fig. 2C. E Toggle-switch model: A nonlinear mathematical model of cell differentiation for generating multistable states is visualized with streamline plots. F ddHodge produces substantially more accurate reconstruction results than does Dynamo: the divergence, curl, and Jacobian (detJ) results obtained using Dynamo and ddHodge are shown. G Accurate recovery of the Jacobian matrix elements with ddHodge. Each panel indicates the estimated value of the Jacobian matrix elements (J11 J12 and J21 J22).

To evaluate the performance of ddHodge in reconstructing dynamic information without dimensionality reduction, we conducted simulations of a dynamical system in which the trajectory of each point on a 2D plane was determined solely by the gradient of the potential U, defined as F(x, y) = −∇U(x, y) (Fig. 2A, 1st and 2nd panels, Methods). We randomly initialized points near the peak of the potential in the lower left region and simulated their trajectories for random durations between 0-4 seconds, obtaining 100 pairs of position and velocity data (Fig. 2A, 3rd and 4th panels). When ddHodge was applied to estimate the potential via the least squares method introduced in HodgeRank13, the reconstructed values agreed well with the theoretical values (Fig. 2A, 5th panel; MSE: 0.001). This result demonstrates that the proposed method can provide high-precision potential reconstruction results even with small datasets and partial sampling of data points.

We next leveraged the geometric interpretation of the estimated potential to reconstruct the shape of the potential landscape. We viewed the least squares potential estimation method as fitting a piecewise quadratic function to the edges of a graph with given slopes at the ends (Supplementary Notes). This approach can be extended to estimate the shape of the potential function (the Hessian matrix H of U). The shape is approximated by collecting fitted piecewise quadratic functions of each cross-section to the neighboring vertex (Fig. 2B, Methods). The shape of the potential indicates whether the cell state traverses the landscape at a constant speed (flat slope; upper case in Fig. 2B) or experiences acceleration, deceleration, or passes through branching points (changing slope; lower case in Fig. 2B).

Next, we verified the reliability of ddHodge's results. We compared the divergence reconstruction performance of ddHodge with that of the discrete exterior calculus (DEC) method21,22, which can be realized as a type of finite element method (FEM), a well-established numerical analysis method (Fig. 2C). The results showed that ddHodge achieved a reconstruction accuracy comparable to or better than that of the DEC method, even when the data boundary, where the DEC method had lower reproducibility, was excluded (yellow triangles in Fig. 2C, D) (Fig. 2D, DEC: MSE = 0.502, ddHodge: MSE = 0.026).

Next, to evaluate the reconstruction performance of ddHodge, we compared ddHodge with Dynamo, which has similar vector-field reconstruction capabilities. In this comparison, we used simulation data from the toggle-switch model, a 2D nonlinear differential equation model (Fig. 2E). We compared the reconstruction results of the two methods using N = 5000 uniformly sampled pairs of position (x, y) and velocity F(x, y) data from the toggle-switch model12. The curl was reconstructed using the ddHodge's divergence of the dual velocity fields (Methods, Supplementary Notes). The results showed that ddHodge significantly outperformed Dynamo in all metrics: the divergence (ddHodge vs. Dynamo: 0.0027 vs. 0.1142), curl (0.0027 vs. 0.0742), and Jacobian (0.0051 vs. 0.1050) (Fig. 2F).

The vector-field reconstruction function in Dynamo, utilizing SparseVFC23, is based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In the context of numerical analysis, as explained in the comparison of DEC and ddHodge, this kernel method can also be viewed as a variant of the numerical method. Specifically, this is a variant of the Galerkin method that utilizes radial basis functions, which applies to higher dimensions. Hence, we further verified whether both could achieve equivalent reconstruction performance in terms of the numerical method with appropriate parameter settings. We thus anticipated that increasing the number of kernel basis functions (parameter M) in SparseVFC would improve accuracy. By varying M in the 2D toggle-switch model simulation, we confirmed that Dynamo's reconstruction accuracy is comparable to ddHodge's around M = 1000 (Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast, ddHodge retained advantages in computational efficiency and exhibited a scaling law with respect to the sampling density (cell number), owing to its use of sparse matrices derived from the local k-nearest-neighbor structure, combined with the efficient Krylov subspace solver.

We also evaluated the robustness of ddHodge to noise by varying the smoothing parameter λ and neighbor count k at different noise levels (SNR = 1000 to 10; see Supplementary Figure S2 and Methods for the definition of SNR). In high-noise environments (SNR = 10), increasing λ from 0.1 to 10.0 improved MSE from 22.3 to 1.27, and increasing k from 6 to 30 under the same conditions dramatically improved MSE from 1.27 to 0.23. These results suggest that increasing k is effective for noisy data.

Furthermore, the Jacobian matrix J can be reconstructed from the accurately reconstructed Hessian matrix and the curl (Methods, Supplementary Notes). We then evaluated the applicability of the proposed method for interaction analyses of gene pairs using J. The clear red and blue bands in the reconstruction results of each element of the Jacobian matrix (∂ẋ/∂x, ∂ẏ/∂x, ∂ẋ/∂y, and ∂ẏ/∂y where ẋ represents dx/dt) faithfully reproduced the regions that respond sensitively to perturbations in genes x and y (Fig. 2G).

These results demonstrate the ability of ddHodge to reconstruct unknown nonlinear dynamics with high accuracy and efficiency, even from partially sampled data.

Next, we aimed to develop a dimensionality reduction method suitable for high-dimensional dynamical systems (Fig. 1C, top). For example, the surface of a sphere in three dimensions can be represented as a collection of small two-dimensional planes (Fig. 3A, top). Based on this concept, we hypothesized that by reconstructing and stitching dynamics within local lower-dimensional spaces (tangent spaces) using a local PCA approach20, both dimensionality reduction and faithful reproductions of high-dimensional dynamics could be achieved while preserving the geometry of the data manifold. The number of parameters in the Hessian matrix estimation process is reduced to m2 < d2, where d is the number of genes and m is the dimension of the tangent spaces. We also considered smoothing (regularization) along the curved axes on the data manifold. In the smoothing process, the axes of adjacent tangent spaces should be matched (Fig. 3A, middle; xu and xv, yu and yv); therefore, using idea of parallel transport in differential geometry20,24,25, we developed a method for designing near-parallel coordinate axes for high-dimensional data using a discrete connection Laplacian (sheaf Laplacian)25,26,27,28 (Fig. 3A, bottom; Supplementary Notes).

A Designing near-parallel coordinates on curved spaces: The surface of a sphere, as an example of a curved 2D space embedded in 3D, is represented by small patches of flat tangent planes (top). The arrows (local x- and y-axes, xu and yu) to the adjacent tangent planes involves the problem of parallel transport (middle). The solution is to find the minimum eigenvalue of a sheaf Laplacian (bottom). B Near-parallel coordinates on a sphere: A triangulated spherical mesh is used as the input graph. The eigenvalues of the sheaf Laplacian reveal the degrees of freedom in designing near-parallel axes. The insets show two examples of designed near-parallel coordinates. C Near-perfect reconstruction of dynamics on a sphere: Scatter plot of N = 2000 random points comparing the reconstructed (horizontal) and analytical (vertical) values of the potential, divergence, and curl on a sphere. The insets show the analytical values, with the peaks of the potential and divergence on the west and east sides and the peaks of the curl on the north and south sides. D Sampling scheme from the Lorenz system: N = 2000 points and velocities sampled at random intervals from 0 to 5 s, starting from a random initial point. E Lower-dimensional representation of Lorenz system: The dynamic indices (potential, curl, and divergence) reconstructed in estimated tangent planes via a local PCA approach, visualized on a global (i.e., including all sampled points) PCA plane. F Grassmann distance reveals hinge points: The distance indicates the folding angle when patching local PCA planes. G Schur decomposition: The section that highlights critical changes at a specified point is selected. The local dynamics can be approximated by the Jacobian matrix J. The rotating dynamics around x₀ (point with the highest curl) on the right side are highlighted by projecting the velocities onto the section spanned by Schur vectors SV1 and SV2.

First, we present a simple example of designing near-parallel coordinates on a sphere (Fig. 3B). We used the graph structure of a triangulated mesh as the input. By adopting the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the connection Laplacian of the input graph, we obtained a near-parallel axis that is consistent24,25 on the surface. We use the term ‘near'-parallel to indicate directions of movement close to parallel transport on curved space. Streamlines on the sphere trace the directions obtained from the eigenvector of the sheaf Laplacian. Singularities, the points that consolidate and resolve coordinate distortions across the entire sphere, appeared to be vortices24 (Fig. 3B right). The leftmost six identical eigenvalues indicate that the total amount of coordinate distortion remains unchanged, regardless of which vector in the 6-dimensional eigenspace is used to construct the axis. Furthermore, there was a gap29 in the spectrum of the eigenvalues from the 7th value onward, corresponding to the doubling of the number of visible vortices.

Next, using velocities sampled from the artificial dynamics simulated on a sphere (Methods), we reconstructed the dynamics with smoothing on the data manifold (Fig. 3C). The potential and divergence were reconstructed with peaks at the east and west ends of the sphere, and the curl was concentrated at the north and south ends, reproducing values approximately identical to the theoretical values (Fig. 3C; inset images, MSEs: 1.0 × 10−3, 4.0 × 10−4, and 1.0 × 10−3, respectively). We further verified the importance of the subspace alignment procedure using an asymmetric saddle-shaped potential example (Supplementary Figure S3). While smoothing results with unaligned axes significantly deviate from theoretical values of the Hessian matrix, subspace alignment using the sheaf Laplacian enables estimation that perfectly matches the theoretical values. These results indicate that both the unknown low-dimensional manifold and the dynamics on the manifold can be accurately recovered from the sampled data.

Next, we validated the interpretability of the lower-dimensional approximation of high-dimensional dynamics using the Lorenz system (Fig. 3D). The dynamics of the Lorenz system are characterized by trajectories that irregularly move between two disks in three-dimensional space. Therefore, we attempted to approximate the dynamics in the space of two joint planes as a data manifold and capture the characteristics of the original dynamics (Fig. 3E). As expected, the main characteristics of rotational behavior were identified by the positive (anticlockwise) and negative (clockwise) curl values on the left and right sides of this space. Additionally, the acceleration in the trajectory in the lower half of the space and deceleration in the upper half of the space were confirmed by the sign of the divergence value. In summary, as indicated by the smaller divergence values compared with the curl values, the dynamics of this system were considered dominated by rotations rather than gradients. Furthermore, the Grassmann distance was used to identify the planar region of the trajectory (cyan) and the hinge region at the center (magenta; points of dimensional change) (Fig. 3F).

The representative variables (genes) driving the dynamics can be identified by the Schur decomposition15,30 of the Jacobian matrix (Fig. 3G, left). Here, we used the ddHodge results in three dimensions without approximating the Lorenz system in 2D space (Fig. 3G, middle). As expected, prominent rotational dynamics were observed on the SV1-SV2 plane at the point at which the curl has its maximum value (Fig. 3G right). We also verified the accuracy of Jacobian matrix reconstruction in tangent space using the Lorenz system and a feedback-loop system (Supplementary Fig. S4). When the estimated tangent space lies within an invariant subspace of the true Jacobian matrix (i.e., when PCA well captures the tangent space), the reconstructed eigenvalues matched the theoretical ones (Supplementary Figure S4A–C). Despite information loss due to dimensionality reduction, qualitative consistency with the true Jacobian matrix will be maintained, demonstrating its applicability to gene interaction analysis (Supplementary Figure S4D–F). These results indicate that the Schur decomposition of the Jacobian matrix is effective for identifying the cross-section of the space containing the representative dynamics nearby specified point (in this example, the cross-section along the disk).

Before scRNA-seq data analysis, we conducted a 100-gene dynamics simulation based on the RNA velocity model31 to verify ddHodge's ability to detect changes in gene-expression dynamics (Supplementary Figure S5A-D). Note that, in standard scRNA-seq analysis, thousands of genes are reduced to less than 100 dimensions through PCA preprocessing, so ddHodge's local PCA approach naturally integrates with existing analysis workflows. By introducing cell-type–specific transcription-rate changes at \(t=3\) and \(t=7\), we simulated cell-type–dependent expression changes. Unlike the Lorenz example, this RNA-velocity simulation presents a difficult setting for ddHodge: because 100 genes evolve independently, no low-dimensional data manifold exists. Nevertheless, after low-dimensional approximation (\(r=4\)), decreases in potential and changes in divergence (Supplementary Figure S5C-D) captured transitions to equilibrium states, the presence of perturbations (rate changes), and points of fate diversification.

These results demonstrate the utility of ddHodge in inferring the behavior associated with the original dynamics, even in the approximate reconstruction of the high-dimensional dynamics.

Next, the scRNA-seq data were analyzed using ddHodge to quantify the potential, which represents the order of cell state transitions, and divergence, which reflects the stability of each cell state (Fig. 4A). In our analysis of scRNA-seq data, the following assumptions are adopted: (1) cells progress through state changes governed by an autonomous dynamical system, (2) both expression levels and velocity measurements are obtainable via existing methods, and (3) the resulting dynamics can be represented on a low-dimensional data manifold. These assumptions are widely used in existing RNA velocity and general scRNA-seq data analysis, including dimensionality reduction processes, and ddHodge operates faithfully within these constraints.

A scRNA-seq data analysis framework: ddHodge takes scRNA-seq data paired with velocity information (e.g., RNA velocity) as input (left). The recovered dynamic indices are overlaid on visualizations such as those obtained via UMAP (middle), providing a global view of high-dimensional dynamics through landscape representations. From this global view, cells of interest can be determined by the extracted dynamical indicators (right), allowing detailed investigation of specified regions (local view) in which gene expression state changes are prominent, as well as the genes involved. B Dynamical indicators extracted during mouse embryogenesis. In addition to clusters and embryonic stages, four dynamical indicators extracted by ddHodge are shown. VASA-seq data from mouse embryos from E6.5 to E9.5 were analyzed here. C The majority of the gene expression dynamic indicators can be explained by a potential landscape: The value of the gradient and the residual of the divergence-free (curl + harmonic) components of recovered dynamics data are shown. For comparison, the results of ddHodge based on the FUCCI dataset, which is expected to have a dominant cyclic component, are also shown. D Changes in the stability of the cell state during development: Box plots show the distribution of divergence values for each developmental stage (Q1, median and Q3; whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR). The sample sizes (n) are 1,277, 7,134, 22,808 and 14,905 individual cells, respectively. The right image shows a canalization-type landscape, where cells transition from diversification (unstable) to convergence (stable). E Summarized dynamics of embryonic development using the height and shape of the potential: For each embryonic day, the vertical axis shows the potential, which indicates the temporal order of the state change, and the horizontal axis shows the divergence (axis is flipped), which represents the stability of the gene expression state. F Simplified landscape view of development: A potential-divergence plot of the surface ectoderm lineages extracted from (E), represented as thin lines. The inset shows the positions of the extracted clusters in the UMAP representation.

In this analysis, we focused on VASA-seq data, which provide highly accurate velocity information due to their high degree of intron coverage6. By leveraging this dataset, we attempted to elucidate the hierarchical differentiation sequence of cell populations and the changes in the stability of the cell state for each cell lineage during the embryogenesis.

The VASA-seq data contained N = 46,124 cells from mouse embryos in the stage of E6.5–9.5. Using the gene expression levels and RNA velocity as inputs, the components of the Hodge decomposition—potential, divergence, curl, and Grassmann distance—were reconstructed and mapped to a low-dimensional UMAP representation using different colors (Fig. 4B). We found that the Grassmann distance remained low across the dataset (median value: 0.43), while the reduced dimension was m = 4. The small Grassmann distance can be interpreted as indicating that the trajectory was confined to almost a flat space, meaning there were no significant changes in the utilized gene sets (dimensions). Conversely, if one finds hinge-like points as shown in the Lorenz system, it can be interpreted that there were points where the utilized gene groups changed significantly. This result suggests that the trajectories of the gene expression dynamics associated with embryonic development reside in a nearly four-dimensional manifold.

We also found a correlation between the potential value and developmental stage, i.e., the potential progressively decreases as development progresses, indicating its utility as a pseudotime indicator12 (Supplementary Figure S6). Similarly, the divergence became increasingly negative as development progressed. Notably, the value of the curl, which reflects cyclic/oscillatory dynamics such as those associated with the cell cycle, was substantially lower than that of the divergence. These findings suggest that the majority of the gene expression dynamics during embryogenesis can be described by a gradient system governed by a potential landscape.

To further confirm that the dynamics of embryogenesis is mainly driven by a gradient system, we quantified the proportion of cyclic or periodic components separated from the gradient component (Fig. 4C). In this dataset, the gradient component accounted for 88.2% of the gene expression dynamics, whereas the divergence-free cyclic component accounted for only 11.7% of the gene expression dynamics. In contrast, in the control dataset of FUCCI-labeled cells32, which specifically represents the progression of the cell cycle, the cyclic component accounted for 49.0% of the dynamics (Fig. 4C, magenta; Methods). In the FUCCI data, the cyclic component was dominant (Supplementary Figure S7A, B). In regions where the divergence-free flow dominates, potential cannot provide a faithful temporal ordering (Supplementary Figure S7C). For circular component visualization, subtracting the gradient component from edge weights reveals the distribution of curl and harmonic components, and we observed strong divergence-free components in the G2M region (Supplementary Figure S7D). These findings suggest that embryonic gene expression dynamics can be explained mainly by the potential rather than by periodic components such as the cell cycle. This underscores the importance of understanding the topography of the landscape to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of embryogenesis.

To further elucidate the biological significance of this divergence, we analyzed its changes over the course of embryogenesis (Fig. 4D). During the early stages (E6.5–E7.5), most cells exhibited positive divergence, indicating an undifferentiated and unstable (divergent) state. In contrast, from E8.5 to E9.5, the divergence values became increasingly negative, suggesting that the gene expression states of the cells tended to converge and stabilize as development progressed. This finding indicates that early embryonic cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, which subsequently decreases as differentiation becomes more defined and cell states stabilize.

Thus, we attempted to describe the dynamics of embryogenesis using only the potential and divergence (Fig. 4E). The epiblast, which possesses pluripotency with high divergence, maintained its cellular identity with a shallow slope (gradient) between E6.5 and E7.5 but was no longer detectable after E8.5. In contrast, cell populations that had diverged into distinct lineages, including the splanchnic mesoderm, emerged beneath the epiblast from E7.5 onward and progressively descended along the landscape toward E9.5, differentiating into more stable cardiac and epithelial lineages. These findings suggest that we successfully visualized the fate decision process that occurs during development according to the height and shape of the potential landscape during gastrulation.

Next, we focused on the surface ectoderm lineage (Fig. 4F). The surface ectoderm, a nonneural ectoderm, gives rise to the epithelium and epidermis of sensory organs. Even at E8.5, pre-epidermal keratinocytes appeared at a higher positions in the plot (potential > 0.5) than the placodal area, suggesting that the epidermal lineage may be specified earlier than the epithelial lineage33. Furthermore, pre-epidermal keratinocytes and the otic epithelium exhibited stable cell states at E9.5, as indicated by the highly negative divergence values (approximately −0.01). In contrast, the divergence of the fusing epithelium, which exhibits gene expression characteristics associated with the amniotic ectoderm, remained close to zero, indicating that the cell state changed with a constant speed, which is a unique property of this type of cell.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that the developmental trajectory of the surface ectoderm lineage is consistent with a recent single-cell study of embryogenesis34,35. Moreover, we successfully quantified the potency of differentiation at each developmental stage using the potential and divergence.

As nonlinear dimensionality reduction is not performed in ddHodge, the genes that drive cell state changes can be tracked. We thus focused on individual points of interest (POIs) at which cell states undergo significant changes and investigated the local dynamics (Fig. 5).

A (Case 1) Stabilization of a cell state with a highly negative divergence in axon elongation: 2000 cells surrounding the selected spinal cord cells that had minimal negative divergence values in cluster 18, including the neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) and forebrain/midbrain cell types, were selected (inset circle; enlarged image of the UMAP plot near the POI). From the Schur decomposition of the Jacobian matrix at the POI, the two dimensions (plane) with the minimal negative eigenvalues were determined. B The velocity of the 2000 selected cells projected onto the identified SV2–SV4 cross-section, along with the genes exhibiting significant changes within this plane, are shown. The cell-type annotation is shown for the top six cell types, and the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of cells in this plot. C (Case 2) Diversification of the cell state with a highly positive divergence in the amniochorionic mesoderm: 2000 cells surrounding amniochorionic mesoderm cells that had maximal positive divergence values in cluster 14, including allantois, extraembryonic mesoderm, and splanchnic mesoderm cell types, were selected. The two Schur vectors with the maximal positive eigenvalues were determined. D The velocity of the 2000 selected cells projected onto the identified SV1–SV3 cross-section, along with the genes exhibiting significant changes within this plane, are shown. The blue to red colors represents the sign (+/-) of divergence values.

To identify cells that become more stable, namely, those with negative divergence values, we selected the POI with the smallest divergence within cluster 18 (Fig. 5A, top right). The Schur decomposition of the Jacobian matrix obtained for this POI revealed a remarkable state change in the SV2-SV4 plane, corresponding to the largest negative eigenvalues. To determine the most related genes in this section, we identified candidate genes using the correlation coefficients between the divergence and gene expression levels for 1000 neighboring cells in the POI (Supplementary Figure S8). The velocities projected onto the SV2-SV4 planes demonstrated that the cell states converged and stabilized (negative divergence); furthermore, Pax6 expression was identified36 (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Fig. S8). Additionally, Nrcam and Robo2, which are genes related to axon guidance37, exhibited strong negative correlations with the divergence values, similar to Pax6, suggesting their involvement in the stabilization of cell states during axial elongation. In contrast, another cell population annotated as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) expressing Cdx2 was positively correlated with divergence (Fig. 5B, top and bottom left panels, Supplementary Figure S8). Cdx2, which is regulated by multiple extracellular signals, has been reported to play a role in maintaining bipotent NMP populations38,39. These findings suggest that the mechanism maintaining undifferentiated NMPs may involve destabilization of cell states through Cdx2 expression. In summary, through this analysis, we identified several genes associated with the spinal cord lineage involved in regulating cell state stability.

To identify genes associated with cell state diversification, we selected another POI with the highest divergence from cluster 14 (Fig. 5C, top right). The neighboring cells of this POI primarily consisted of two amnion-like cell groups (annotated as A and B) (Fig. 5C, D). The Schur decomposition of the Jacobian matrix at the POI revealed two branches along the SV1 axis, with one group diverging to the right (A) and the other to the left (B). Since the loading vector of the Schur decomposition can be used to identify genes that are strongly associated with the selected axis (Supplementary Figure S9), we attempted to identify the genes with the highest weights in the loading vector. Ptch1 presented the highest loading value along the SV1 axis, suggesting the important role of this gene in A/B fate determination (Fig. 5D, top). Ptch1, the receptor of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), has been reported to be expressed in the allantois, leading to the arrest of the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition and the progression of morphogenesis40. Therefore, only group A, which expresses Ptch1, may undergo de-repression via Shh signaling and transition to a distinct cell state. Additionally, Slc2a1, which encodes a glucose transporter of Glut1, presented the highest loading value on the SV3 axis; however, its expression level increased with developmental progression in both A and B. In summary, this axis-based approach can provide a biological interpretation similar to that of PCA.

As an extra verification with real data, we applied ddHodge to a muscle regeneration dataset41. ddHodge-derived metrics can be visualized by coloring points on UMAP, focusing on muscle satellite-cell activation and muscle differentiation processes (Supplementary Figure S10A). High-divergence regions (red) were observed on the upper side of the MuSCs cluster, suggesting the need for a detailed analysis of presumable fate-bifurcation points. This high-divergence region was selected as a POI. Schur decomposition analysis was performed (Supplementary Figure S10B). By visualizing divergence values and velocity-vector projections on the SV1–SV2 plane, we succeeded in extracting the moment of fate-determination in asymmetric-division, which is composed of Myog (muscle-differentiation marker) and Cdkn1c (cell-cycle control) expression axes (Supplementary Figure S10C).

Furthermore, compared to ordinal differential gene expression (DEG) analysis aimed at detecting marker genes selectively expressed in each cluster, ddHodge has the characteristic of detecting genes that change rapidly (accelerate/decelerate or diverge/contraction) within clusters, so the importance scores of both do not necessarily match (Supplementary Figure S11). ddHodge's exploratory analysis using divergence as an indicator successfully captures the behavior of cellular state destabilization at this fate bifurcation point, that tend to be overlooked by conventional RNA velocity analysis and DEG analysis. In addition to divergence, other dynamical indicators calculated by ddHodge can be exported in anndata format, making it compatible with many single-cell data visualization tools (Supplementary Figure S12). This enables interactive POI selection considering biological context while confirming gene expression and cell-type annotations within each cell type.

Here, we developed ddHodge as a method for reconstructing the original vector field using pairs of sampling points and their velocities obtained from an unknown system. By utilizing RNA velocities as inputs, ddHodge extends the capabilities of existing methods by allowing evaluations of both the direction of cell state changes and the stability of each state, which indicates a potency of change, which has not previously been evaluated. We further confirmed that the majority of the gene expression dynamics in embryogenesis can be described as a gradient system (i.e., a potential landscape), which was previously unclear. Furthermore, we quantified the difficulty of lineage transitions from the divergence values, complementing traditional trajectory analyses of cell fate conceptualized by the epigenetic landscape. Additionally, we identified genes that influence the stability of the cell state.

In this study, we demonstrated that the potential and divergence reconstructed from RNA velocity data can serve as indicators for identifying points at which cell states converge and diversify. Furthermore, ddHodge can be used to extract cross-sections of high-dimensional space and identify key regulatory genes that govern local dynamics. Since this framework is general and requires only a weak assumption that the velocity is sampled from an autonomous system, ddHodge can be broadly applied to various types of velocity data, including chromatin velocity data, protein velocity data, time-resolved measurements of cellular positions, and even simulation data from theoretical models of high-dimensional dynamical systems. Notably, as evidenced by the constructed interpretations of the high-dimensional dynamic indicators in both the simulations with the Lorenz system and the application to the RNA velocity data, the approximated velocity field on the data manifold does not necessarily need to precisely capture the true underlying dynamics.

Many methods have been proposed for scRNA-seq dynamics analysis, each with different interests and goals42. Methods such as DeepVelo43 and GraphVelo44 primarily focus on improving the estimation or embedding of RNA velocity, with the explicit vector-field reconstruction falling within the scope of Dynamo and ddHodge. By contrast, Graph-Dynamo17 takes a different conceptual approach, modeling stochastic cellular-state dynamics governed by a Fokker–Planck equation, focusing on transition probabilities among metastable states and exit times. ddHodge performs component-wise and precise reconstruction of vector fields—potential, divergence, and curl–on manifold via Hodge decomposition in a DEC–like, structure-preserving manner. It further provides principled cross-sectional analysis in tangent space (via Schur decomposition) while ensuring geometry-preserving dimensional reduction.

Reconstructing a high-dimensional Jacobian that encodes all gene interactions is fundamentally impossible after dimensionality reduction. A similar limitation arises when the dynamics are intrinsically confined to a low-dimensional data manifold, such as the disk-like structures in the Lorenz and feedback-loop examples, because velocity components orthogonal to this low-dimensional structure are never observed. In these situations, just as after dimensionality reduction, the full ambient-space Jacobian cannot be identified by any method—including ddHodge or Dynamo—unless additional assumptions or biases are imposed on the unobserved directions. Given this intrinsic constraint, the meaningful object that remains accessible is the Jacobian restricted to the tangent space of the manifold. The Schur vectors of the tangent-space Jacobian can be interpreted as composite axes, analogous to PCA loading vectors. As illustrated in Fig. 5, this enables identification and interpretation of genes that drive fate transitions, including those exhibiting rapid expression changes.

ddHodge reconstructs the fundamental components of vector fields, including the potential, divergence, curl, and harmonic by overcoming several difficulties associated with analyses performed in high-dimensional spaces. For example, in the DEC method, these difficulties include constructing the mesh, evaluating areas and volumes, which are required to determine the densities and constructing discrete Hodge stars21,22. With our approach, we could accurately estimate the divergence by applying previously intractable numerical analysis methods to higher-dimensional spaces without considering boundary conditions. Additionally, we developed a method for estimating the curl in spaces of three or more dimensions. To address concerns regarding the reliability of the results due to noise and limited sample sizes—challenges inherent in data analysis—we incorporated a dedicated smoothing strategy in ddHodge. However, due to computational constraints, we have not yet produced a strict reconstruction of the curl component with ddHodge; instead, an approximation strategy that recovers the rotational features only within the PC1-2 plane is employed in the current version of ddHodge.

We observed regions that exhibited higher curl values in the mouse gastrulation data, specifically in areas associated with hematopoietic processes. These regions may represent dynamics like strong perturbation components orthogonal to the gradient direction, rather than gentle periodic/cyclical dynamics. In this paper, we did not focus on the interpretation of strong curl components. However, in the future, we need to pursue a deeper biological interpretation, as well as a complete reconstruction of the curl components. Further interpretation of divergence-free periodic components may be feasible by developing efficient methods for computing curl by Hodge duals in high-dimensional spaces and establishing appropriate interpretative frameworks, such as optimal cycles45, to obtain a succinct representation of the harmonic components in higher-dimensional spaces.

Owing to its scalability to high-dimensional data without the need for mesh construction, this method has potential as a tool for supporting data analysis involving high-dimensional complex dynamic systems. The remaining fundamental challenges are interpretating the recovered dynamic indicators in the context of existing knowledge and experimentally validating the proposed method.

This section outlines the ddHodge workflow. Detailed explanations and illustrations are provided in the Supplemental Notes. We assume that the input data consist of \(d\)-dimensional points \({{\mathcal{X}}}=\{{{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{1},{{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{2},\ldots,{{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{N}\}\) and their corresponding velocities \({{\mathcal{V}}}=\{{{{\boldsymbol{v}}}}_{1},{{{\boldsymbol{v}}}}_{2},\ldots,{{{\boldsymbol{v}}}}_{N}\}\). Additionally, a \(k\)-nearest neighbors (k-NN) graph \({{\mathcal{G}}}=\left(V,E\right)\) is constructed from \({{\mathcal{X}}}\).

First, PCA is performed using the \(k\)-nearest neighbors of each point \({{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{i}\) to obtain the orthonormal basis \(\{{{{\boldsymbol{o}}}}_{1}^{i},{{{\boldsymbol{o}}}}_{2}^{i},\ldots,{{{\boldsymbol{o}}}}_{r}^{i}\}\) of the tangent vector space \({T}_{i}{{\mathcal{M}}}\), where \(r\le k\). Since the tangent spaces of neighboring vertices generally have different subspaces, we construct a discrete connection Laplacian \({\Delta }_{s}\) using sheaves on graphs to align the local coordinates within the tangent spaces. The alignment is performed by minimizing the following loss function \(L\) over the set of tangent vectors \({{{\boldsymbol{z}}}}_{i}\in {T}_{i}{{\mathcal{M}}}\):

where \({{\boldsymbol{z}}}\) is the vector formed by stacking \({{{\boldsymbol{z}}}}_{1},{{{\boldsymbol{z}}}}_{2},\ldots,{{{\boldsymbol{z}}}}_{N}\) vertically. The matrices \({\widetilde{O}}_{i}\) and \({\widetilde{O}}_{j}\) are obtained from the singular value decomposition \({O}_{i}^{\top }{O}_{j}=U\varSigma {V}^{{\top }}\), where \({O}_{i}=\left[{{{\boldsymbol{o}}}}_{1}^{i}{{{\boldsymbol{o}}}}_{2}^{i}\cdots {{{\boldsymbol{o}}}}_{r}^{i}\right]\), and \({\widetilde{O}}_{i}={U}^{{\top }}\), \({\widetilde{O}}_{j}={V}^{{{\top }}}\).

The eigenvector associated with the minimum eigenvalue of \({\Delta }_{s}\) is the minimizer of \(L\).

The potential \({{\boldsymbol{u}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) corresponding to the gradient component of the vector field is estimated using the gradient operator \({\delta }_{0}={{\rm{grad}}}\), which is an \(M\times N\) matrix, and the edge weights \({{\boldsymbol{w}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{M}\) of graph \({{\mathcal{G}}}\). The estimation is performed via the least squares method as follows:

where \(N\) and \(M\) represent the number of vertices and edges in \({{\mathcal{G}}}\), respectively. In this study, the edge weights \({w}_{\left(i,j\right)}\) are defined as:

In this definition, the integral of the flux is approximated along the edge direction and is equivalent to fitting a quadratic function to the cross-section of potential function \(U\) (see Supplementary Notes for more details).

For a point \({{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{i}\), let \({{\boldsymbol{\eta }}}={{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{j}-{{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{i}\) be the vector indicating the direction from this point to a neighboring point \({{{\boldsymbol{x}}}}_{j}\). The second-order directional differential coefficient of the fitted quadratic function is given by:

The Hessian matrix \(H\) in the original coordinate system can be obtained via a quadratic form. For example, in two dimensions of x-y plane, the relationship is expressed as:

By gathering the known second-order differential coefficients such as \({U}_{\eta \eta }\) in independent directions \({\bf{\varphi}},{\boldsymbol{\psi}},\ldots\), the linear equation can be constructed to estimate the elements of \(H\).

We denote the above equation as \(C{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}={{\boldsymbol{y}}}\). The divergence is obtained from \(-{{\rm{tr}}}H\) after estimating \(H\). In practice, the problem is better solved as an optimization problem \({\min }_{{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}}\parallel C{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}-{{\boldsymbol{y}}}{\parallel }^{2}\) to mitigate issues in data analysis, such as those related to noise and the limited sample size. Additionally, since the number of Hessian matrix elements (number of estimated parameters) increases on the order of \({d}^{2}\), the Hessian matrix is estimated in the reduced-dimensional space.

To enable the regularization of the estimation process between neighboring vertices, we merged the individual Hessian matrix estimation problems as a single linear equation:

This allows us to introduce a penalty (Dirichlet energy on the graph) to the squares of the differences \({{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}}_{i}-{{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}}_{j}\) between adjacent vertices as:

Here, assume that the \(p\) parameters are arranged in a certain order as \({{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}}_{i}=\left({U}_{{xx}}^{i},{U}_{{xy}}^{i},{U}_{{yy}}^{i}\right)\), such that the differences between each parameter can be individually evaluated using the extended gradient matrix \({D}_{0}={\delta }_{0}\otimes {I}_{p}\) with the Kronecker product and \({L}_{0}={D}_{0}^{{{\top }}}{D}_{0}\).

The optimization problem with this regularization term is then solved as:

with some small constant \(\lambda > 0\).

Given the large \({Np}\times {Np}\) size of the sparse matrix \({L}_{0}\), efficient solvers such as the Krylov subspace method are recommended.

For differential forms in the Euclidean space \({{\mathbb{R}}}^{2}\), the relationship between \({{\rm{div}}}\) and \({{\rm{curl}}}\) is given by:

where \(d\) is the exterior derivative and \(\star\) is the Hodge star operator. Therefore, the curl can be approximated by the divergence of the dual vector field \(\star \xi\), which is obtained by rotating the velocity by \(\pi /2\) in the PC1-2 plane.

According to the theory of Hodge decomposition, a vector field can be expressed as the sum of a gradient part \(-\nabla U\) and a divergence-free residual part \(r\):

Here, let \(D\) be the operator that gives the Jacobian matrix of \(f\). Since \(D\) is linear and \(D\nabla U\) gives the Hessian matrix \(H\) of \(U\), \(D\left(f\right)\) has the following decomposition:

If \(r\) consists of only rotational components (i.e., there are no holes in the space), \(D\left(r\right)\) can be expressed using the matrix \(Q\), representing a \(\pi /2\) rotation in the PC1-2 plane, as \(D\left(r\right)=\frac{\theta }{2}Q\). Here, \(\theta\) is the magnitude of the rotation, which is calculated from the previously derived \({{\rm{curl}}}\).

ddHodge was implemented in Julia, a high-performance scientific programming language. The computation time depends on the number of analyzed cells and the dimensionality of the components after the reduction process is performed. The most computationally intensive parts are computing eigenvalues and solving least-squares problems with large sparse matrices. To optimize these calculations, we employ the Krylov subspace method (KrylovKit.jl), which efficiently handles sparse matrices by leveraging repeated matrix‒vector multiplication operations. With GPU acceleration (we used NVIDIA RTX A2000 12 GB), the computation takes approximately 35 seconds for 46,124 cells with the parameter: k = 12 of k-NN graph and r = 4 of reduced dimension, and approximately 2 minutes for another dataset with 98,316 cells with the same parameter (Figs. 4–5).

To create a gradient system in a 2D plane, we use the Gaussian function as follows:

We constructed a potential function with peaks and valleys as follows:

Using this potential function, we simulate the differential equation \({{\boldsymbol{F}}}\left(x,y\right)=-\nabla U\left(x,y\right)\). The simulation is performed by adding noise (Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.2) to the initial positions at the center of the potential peak and running random simulations for 0 to 4 s using the Runge–Kutta method. We sampled \(N=100\) points and their velocities.

The toggle-switch model is defined by the following set of differential equations:

The parameters are set to \({K}_{1}={K}_{2}=1/2,n=4\), and \({a}_{1}={a}_{2}={b}_{1}={b}_{2}=1\). The same simulation result from Dynamo's paper was reproduced by following the instructions at the following link: https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo_submission.

The Lorenz system is defined by the following set of differential equations:

The parameters are set to \(\sigma=10\), \(\rho=28\), and \(\beta=8/3\). The simulation is performed by initializing \(\left(x,y,z\right)=\left(10,10,10\right)\) with added Gaussian noise \(N\left(3,0\right)\) and sampling points after a random time \(T\), which was generated from a uniform distribution \(T\sim U\left(0.5,5\right)\).

We consider RNA-velocity data with scaled degradation rate \(\widetilde{\gamma }=\gamma /\beta=1.0\). Such a condition emulates a scenario in which the steady states lie on the diagonal \({u}_{s}={s}_{s}\) in the spliced–unspliced plane (i.e., the ratio of spliced to unspliced counts is 1:1). We generated a proxy for the unspliced count \(u=\widetilde{\gamma }s+v\) because \({ds}/{dt}\propto v=u-\widetilde{\gamma }s\), where \(v\) is the (scaled) velocity. To set the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we fixed the signal scale at \({\sigma }_{s}=1.0\) so that the sampled region \([0,4]\times [0,4]\) in the toggle-switch simulation is nearly covered by the 2D Gaussian \({{\mathscr{N}}}((2,2),{\sigma }_{s}^{2}I)\). Then, SNR is defined by \({\sigma }_{s}/{\sigma }_{n}\) when the noise is drawn from \({{\mathscr{N}}}((0,0),{\sigma }_{s}^{2}I)\).

The edge weights \({{\boldsymbol{w}}}\) are determined by velocity (see the Potential estimation section in Methods). Then, we calculate the vector \({{\boldsymbol{u}}}\) representing potential values at vertices, which allows us to determine the gradient component at edges as \(-{\delta }_{0}{{\boldsymbol{u}}}\). We set the magnitude of the gradient component as \(p\). Next, the cyclic (divergence-free) component \({{\boldsymbol{r}}}={{\boldsymbol{w}}}+{\delta }_{0}{{\boldsymbol{u}}}\) obtained by subtracting the gradient \(-{\delta }_{0}{{\boldsymbol{u}}}\) from weight \({{\boldsymbol{w}}}\). The magnitude of the cyclic component is similarly calculated as content \(q\), and the proportions of \(p\) and \(q\) represent the proportion of the gradient and cyclic components on the graph. These quantities are summarized as follows:

The gradient and divergence-free components are orthogonal, and they satisfy \({{\langle }}{\delta }_{0}{{\boldsymbol{u}}},{{\boldsymbol{r}}}{{\rangle }}=0\). Therefore, their normalized contributions in \({{\boldsymbol{w}}}\) sum to one: \((p+q)/\parallel {{\boldsymbol{w}}}{\parallel }^{2}=1\).

Velocities were estimated using scvelo (version 0.3.2). For cell-type annotation, the scRNA-seq data of mouse embryos34 were used as training data for Celltypist (version 1.6.3), and the cell-type labels were given for the VASA-seq data. The analysis using ddHodge was performed with a \(k\)-NN graph where \(k=12\) and the reduced dimensionality was \(r=4\). The detailed methods for reproducing the data analysis are available on GitHub.

Although computational models have deepened our understanding of neuroscience, it is still highly challenging to link actual low-level physiological activity (spiking, field potentials) and biochemistry (transmitters and receptors) directly with high-level cognitive abilities (decision-making, working memory) and associated disorders. Here, we introduce a mechanistically accurate multi-scale model directly generating simulated physiology from which extended neural and cognitive phenomena emerge. The model produces spiking, fields, phase synchronies, and synaptic change, directly generating working memory, decisions, and categorization. These were then validated on extensive experimental macaque data from which the model received no prior training of any kind. Moreover, the simulation uncovered a previously unknown neural code (“incongruent neurons”) that specifically predicts upcoming erroneous behaviors, also subsequently confirmed in empirical data. The biomimetic model thus directly and predictively links decision and reinforcement signals, of computational interest, with spiking and field codes, of neurobiological importance.

Electrophysiological recordings from macaque brain under category learning paradigm that was used for validation in this paper can be accessed at : https://github.com/Neuroblox/Neuroblox.jl/blob/main/RESOURCES.md. This includes preprocessed LFP signals and spikes from PFC and Striatum. Source data for the figures are provided with this paper. Source data are provided with this paper.

The model shown here is now a part of Neuroblox computational neuroscience platform (https://www.neuroblox.ai/), which includes an easy-to-use GUI as well as documentation and tutorials. A standalone Julia implementation of the model can be found at https://github.com/Neuroblox/Neuroblox.jl/blob/main/RESOURCES.md.

Brain metastasis (BM) carries a poor prognosis, yet the molecular basis of brain tropism remains unclear. Analysis of breast cancer BM (BCBM) revealed pervasive p53 inactivation through mutations and/or aneuploidy, with pathway disruption already present in primary tumors. Functionally, p53 inactivation markedly increased BCBM formation and growth in vivo, causally linking p53 perturbation to BM. Mechanistically, p53 inactivation upregulated SCD1 and fatty acid synthesis (FAS), essential for brain-metastasizing cells; SCD1 knockout abolished the p53-dependent growth advantage. Molecularly, p53 suppressed SCD1 directly through promoter binding and indirectly by downregulating its co-activator DEPDC1. Astrocytes further enhanced FAS by secreting factors that were metabolized in a p53-dependent manner, promoting tumor survival, proliferation and migration. Finally, p53-deficient tumors were sensitive to FAS inhibition ex vivo and in vivo. Thus, we identify p53 inactivation as a driver of BCBM, reveal p53-dependent and astrocyte-dependent FAS modulation and highlight FAS as a therapeutically targetable BCBM vulnerability.

Acting as a consultant enables academics to share their expertise, develop their skills and bring funding to organizations. Credit: Getty

Universities have three core missions: research, teaching and societal impact. The third is increasingly defined in commercial terms. The number of intellectual property licences has increased and more spin-out companies are being formed. This shift is supported by an independent review of spin-out practices1, standardized investment guidance2 and the professionalization of university technology-transfer offices3.

The future of universities

The future of universities

By contrast, academic consulting work, one of the most direct and scalable means by which academics can shape industry, government and civil society, remains underdeveloped (see ‘Consulting gap').

Consulting work and other routes for exchanging knowledge are often treated as administrative functions. Such activities are defined and measured inconsistently and receive limited recognition in evaluations of research-related innovation. At a time when universities are struggling financially and academic research is often seen as distant from people's everyday concerns, that must change.

Here, we call for universities to make it easier for academics to carry out consulting work. If the work is properly supported, it can diversify income, build enduring partnerships and ensure that research delivers a tangible impact.

There are widespread benefits to academics offering their advice to outside organizations for a fee. For higher-education institutions, consulting work can provide a flexible stream of income at a time of financial strain. It can foster partnerships with industry and government that generate collaborative research, joint ventures and fresh sources of funding.

It reinforces universities' reputation as engines of applied knowledge and economic and societal impact. For example, one small software team at the University of Southampton, UK, turned open-source verification tools into more than £600,000 (US$799,000) of consulting income by advising on safety-critical railway systems between 2014 and 2021 (see go.nature.com/44ueoch). 

For academics, consulting also offers professional development, wider networks, financial reward and real-world experience. It creates career porosity between academia, industry and policy, opening routes into leadership roles. For example, consulting can underpin the spin-out-company model: an academic who created intellectual property might be engaged as a ‘fractional executive' through a consulting contract, allowing them to contribute to the company and develop leadership skills. Consulting work also enriches the research culture of higher-education institutions, giving academics direct feedback on how their work is used in practice, informing grant proposals and strengthening career progression.

For society, consulting accelerates the application of knowledge to national priorities, such as clean energy, health and social policy. It provides a mechanism for organizations to benefit from publicly funded research. It also ensures university expertise is applied beyond the campus walls, and can feed back into teaching with real-world case studies that better prepare graduates for the workforce.

Higher-education institutions could embed modules that simulate the practice of consulting engagements to enhance students' understanding of work. In one example, industry-led consulting projects were developed at Henley Business School, UK, to give master's students hands-on experience.

Consulting, therefore, is one of the most immediate channels through which universities can deliver societal impact. These projects are typically shorter in duration and easier to set up than other routes to impact, such as spin-out companies. Yet, across most institutions, consulting receives limited attention.

Using data from the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency on the number of consultancy contracts and academic staff at nine universities, we found that less than 10% of academic staff, on average, engaged in consulting work. Academic consulting is worth roughly £500–600 million per year (£566 million in 2023–24). That's equivalent to 0.6% of the UK management consulting market value (£92 billion according to the Office for National Statistics), or 2.8% of the sector, based on the definition of the London-based Management Consultancies Association (£20.4 billion).

Over the past decade, the number of academic consulting contracts has fallen by 38% from around 99,000 in 2014–15 to fewer than 62,000 in 2023–24. Higher average values of contracts have driven some growth, with the linear trend in total academic consultancy income rising by 31% from 2014–15 to 2023–24. But that falls short of the trend in the UK management consulting sector, which was 51% over that period.

Some institutions have demonstrated what is possible. In 2023–24, 17 UK universities earned more than £10 million annually from consulting work across a vast range of disciplines and industries, including drug-development advice, advanced materials testing, digital health evaluation, engineering analysis, and policy and socio-economic consulting.

Data are less available for institutions in other countries; limited information (including personal communications with US technology-transfer offices) suggests that consulting income typically does not make up a large share of institutional turnover. This suggests a global underutilization of academic expertise through consulting, even among the world's most research-intensive universities — and a lost revenue stream for higher education. Management consulting alone in the United States was valued at $407 billion in 2025, according to market research firm IBIS World.

Private consultancy firms are increasingly moving into this underexploited market, capturing opportunities that universities neglect. Small-scale (under £5,000), fast-turnaround, one-off projects are commonly sidelined by university contract offices because they represent too small an income for strained institutional resources, creating space for contract-research organizations and technical consultancies with the agility to capture this demand. If universities do not act, global professional services firms will continue to dominate the space in which academic insight could deliver direct societal benefit.

Weak institutional policies on consulting are one reason for this missed opportunity. We examined policies at 30 universities hosting at least 5 UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellows — a 7-year fellowship programme designed to develop research and innovation leaders in academia and business — supplemented by surveys of 76 fellows and interviews with technology-transfer staff at the same universities. Our analysis reflects practices across a subset of research-intensive institutions, including our own, and is intended to inform sector-wide discussion rather than prescribe a single model.

Great science happens in great teams — research assessments must try to capture that

Great science happens in great teams — research assessments must try to capture that

The results reveal a fragmented system. Two-thirds of the universities we surveyed have publicly available policies, two of which prohibit private consulting. Permitted university-contracted time for consulting ranges from unlimited to 30 days or fewer per year, or to personal time only. Institutional charges range from 10–40% of consulting fees.

When we conducted interviews with staff who manage academic consulting services across multiple UK universities, administrative delays and inconsistent incentives or recognition of consulting were often cited as common issues. The result is a patchwork of practice, in which opportunities depend less on expertise and more on institutional flexibility.

The financial outcomes for academics vary widely, from flexible fees agreed between client and academic to university-set day rates. Some academics choose to put their consulting income into research accounts at their institution to support their group or department, but whether this is permitted, and on what terms, varies between universities and even across departments in the same institution. At some organizations, up to 50% of an individual's earnings can be diverted into institutional research funds.

Services to support academic consulting also differ between universities and within them, with some departments or technology-transfer offices providing insurance, contracting and negotiation support, and other institutions providing none. Contract approvals range from a 24-hour turnaround to months of negotiations. Faced with these obstacles, some academics turn to private consulting conducted outside their employment contracts, often without legal cover and sometimes in breach of institutional terms.

Adiabatic topological pumping offers a robust mechanism for light transport in integrated photonics, enabling the development of efficient on-chip photonic devices. However, its practical implementations face significant challenges in maintaining both high transport efficiency and scalability due to slow adiabatic modulation requirements, and existing acceleration strategies fall short in achieving substantial device miniaturization. Here, we develop a gap-mode strategy for constructing shortcut to topological pumping, and experimentally demonstrate a superadiabatic paradigm through iterative adiabatic transformations in an on-chip photonic platform. Our approach achieves a 20-fold footprint reduction compared to conventional adiabatic pumping and a 50% size reduction relative to optimized Landau-Zener (as well as recently reported quantum metric and adiabatic infimum) implementations. The device operates over a remarkable bandwidth of 650–920 nm while facilitating scalable waveguide integration. This methodology establishes a framework for realizing high-efficiency topological photonic transport with tailored coupling configurations, paving the way for ultra-compact photonic integrated circuits.

Time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) is a powerful technique for probing quasiparticle interactions in quantum materials under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we implement tr-RIXS at the carbon K-edge to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of core excitons coupled to vibrational modes in graphite. Using femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser, we monitor the temporal evolution of vibronically dressed excitons and their interaction with symmetry-selective optical phonons. By tuning the incident photon energy across the 1s → σ* resonance and analyzing the integrated inelastic sideband intensity, we reveal a detuning-controlled crossover between two complementary dynamical regimes. Phenomenological modeling and first-principles calculations reproduce both the magnitude and detuning dependence of the spectral-weight changes. In this work, enabled by the unique capabilities of X-ray free-electron lasers, we demonstrate how tr-RIXS can access coupled electronic and lattice dynamics with elemental and symmetry specificity, opening new routes to control vibronic interactions in light-element and low-dimensional quantum materials.

The data that support the findings of this study, including raw and processed RIXS spectra, XAS profiles, and analysis outputs, are publicly available in the Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A. repository under the title Dataset of Ultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core excitons in graphite at https://doi.org/10.34965/i53456.

Privacy isn't dead. Just ask Kristi Noem.

The Department of Homeland Security secretary has spent 2025 trying to convince the American public that identifying roving bands of masked federal agents is “doxing”—and that revealing these public servants' identities is “violence.” Noem is wrong on both fronts, legal experts say, but her claims of doxing highlight a central conflict in the current era: Surveillance now goes both ways.

Over the nearly 12 months since President Donald Trump took office for a second time, life in the United States has been torn asunder by relentless arrests and raids by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and federal, state, and local authorities deputized to carry out immigration actions. Many of these agents are hiding their identities on the administration-approved basis that they are the ones at risk. US residents, in response, have ramped up their documentation of law enforcement activity to seemingly unprecedented levels.



“ICE watch” groups have appeared across the country. Apps for tracking immigration enforcement activity have popped up on (then disappeared from) Apple and Google app stores. Social media feeds are awash in videos of unidentified agents tackling men in parking lots, throwing women to the ground, and ripping families apart. From Los Angeles to Chicago to Raleigh, North Carolina, neighbors and passersby have pulled out their phones to document members of their communities being arrested and vanishing into the Trump administration's machinery.

That's not to say it's new, of course. Documenting law enforcement activity to counter the he said, he said imbalance of power between police and civilians is practically an American tradition, says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties nonprofit. “This goes back at least as far as the 1968 Democratic Convention when journalists documented police officers rioting and beating up protesters—and lying about who was responsible for this,” he says.

Jennifer Granick, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, says the practice likely goes back “centuries.” Indeed, documenting police activity is likely as old as policing itself. “The difference [today] is that technology has made it so everybody has a video recorder with them at all times,” Granick says. “And then it's very easy to get that recording out to the public.”

Non-journalists recording police activity entered the mainstream after a bystander, George Holliday, videotaped Los Angeles Police Department officers brutally beating Rodney King, a Black man, in March 1991 and shared the footage with local media. The video would set off a national reckoning over race and policing in modern America.

National unrest sparked again in 2020 after a teenager recorded a white Minnesota police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on the neck of 46-year-old George Floyd. (Chauvin was later convicted of Floyd's murder.) The Black Lives Matter movement that followed the death of Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police grew hot and fast that summer thanks to social media and the easy recording and sharing of video footage. In 2025, the practice of recording police on a systematic scale turned from an activity largely carried out by protesters and activists into a populist practice carried out by anyone who happens to be around.

“What we are seeing in the last year is an escalation by law enforcement of what they are doing in our communities, including sending armed, masked thugs onto our streets to detain people for no reason other than that they look like they are Mexican and subjecting them to humiliating, dangerous encounters,” says Schwartz. “And so, many Americans—as they have been doing for decades when they see the police officers on their streets acting like lawless rogue thugs—have pulled out their cameras and documented them.”

The Trump administration's response has been swift and punitive, and it has met with mixed results. In September, a federal grand jury indicted three people for allegedly following an ICE agent home while “livestreaming his home address on Instagram.” The same month, DHS subpoenaed Instagram owner Meta in an attempt to unmask six Instagram accounts “pursuant to an official, criminal investigation regarding officer safety.” (In early December, the subpoena was withdrawn.) Escalating matters further, the FBI has reportedly launched “criminal and domestic terrorism investigations” into “threats against immigration enforcement activity” in at least 23 areas around the US, according to a bureau document obtained by The Guardian.

Doxing is not a legal term nor a formal criminal offense. But even that could change if Trump administration allies have their way. In June, Republican senator Marsha Blackburn introduced the Protecting Law Enforcement From Doxing Act. It has yet to receive any movement in Congress from Blackburn's fellow lawmakers.

Outside legal avenues, Schwartz says, supporters of the Trump administration have been “jawboning” people on social media in an attempt to pressure them to remove the content that they've put up, or to get information about the people uploading that content from their social media profiles.

To be clear, the public generally has the right to record police in public, provided they're not interfering with official business. As Schwartz put it, this kind of government accountability is “a basic paradigm under our Constitution.” Furthermore, Schwartz emphasizes that calling public accountability “surveillance” is the wrong way to think about it. “What the government owes to people is that the people get to be private,” Schwartz says. “What the government owes the public is transparency. The public gets to know what the government is doing.”

Granick agrees. “I don't think that police or ICE agents have an expectation of privacy when they are out in public as government officials claiming to be doing the public's business,” Granick says. “In those situations, the public has a right to know what they're doing.”

The notion of privacy in America is ever-changing—an evolution supercharged by social media, data collection, and the post-9/11 surveillance state. Some may see the increase in populist accountability of ICE and other law enforcement as a further erosion of privacy overall. Granick, however, says it's nothing compared to the government surveillance everyone is up against.

“The police have license plate readers, and camera networks, and warrants to get the content of our communications, and other legal means to get information about our communications,” Granick says. “The government so far outstrips the ability of regular people to find out what they're doing. And when we're talking about a distributed network of observers, it doesn't compare to the level of privacy intrusion that the government not just is capable of, but takes advantage of all the time.”

4/10

The Nintendo Switch family of consoles is great at a lot of things, but you know what they're not any good at? Being an arcade cabinet from the 1980s. OK, it's probably a highly specific market lamenting that one oversight, but if you find yourself in that niche, then UK-based peripheral maker iMP Tech might have just the thing for you.

The Mini Arcade Pro is an arcade cabinet shell compatible with the original Switch, the Switch OLED, and the Switch 2. It's built around an eight-button base unit with a retro-style eight-way joystick, emulating the look and feel of classic rigs, with your console slotting in to serve as the screen. It also packs in a few touches you wouldn't find in the arcade, like a mappable Turbo feature.

Given the Switch is home to a host of classic arcade-style games—thanks to titles included in the Nintendo Switch Online libraries for NES, SNES, and Genesis/Mega Drive, and through various retro releases such as Namco Museum over the years—this should make for a gadget perfect for delivering some (slightly gimmicky) throwback fun. Sadly, it's marred by production and design issues, making it hard to recommend.

The Mini Arcade Pro comes flat-packed in seven pieces, though you'll only use six to put it together—there's a tray each for the original Switch models and the Switch 2. Each of those is hinged, allowing you to insert the core tablet of either console, and then seals magnetically to hold it safely in place. It's all fairly intuitive to snap together. A rear panel adds stability and 12 storage slots for Switch game cards, and then the console tray slides into place, docking onto a male USB connector. A marquee strip then snaps onto the top, holding everything together. The arcade base draws power from the console, but a through-port underneath allows you to plug a USB-C charger.

The unit pairs with the console as a controller, which involves a little bit of menu diving and telling your Switch to regard it as a Pro Controller in wired communication mode. If you usually use a Pro Controller wirelessly, you'll need to swap this setting each time. For anyone using a Switch 2, the cabinet can use the console's wake function and has a C button to activate GameChat—connecting a camera might be a bit tricky given the setup, but the Switch 2's built-in microphone suffices for voice chat.

Once it's all assembled, the cabinet weighs 891 grams when using the Switch 2 shell, and an even sturdier 1,200 grams when the Switch 2 tablet is inserted. With four large, rubber feet, it feels nice and stable on most surfaces—you'd have to be engaging in some vigorous joystick wiggling to send it flying.

There is a hitch using this cabinet with the Switch 2, specifically—the recent 21.0.0 system update means that Mini Arcade Pro units with batch number 0925 need a firmware update to work properly. It's not only iMP Tech caught out by this—many third-party peripherals seem to be having issues as a result—but the fix requires a cable with a female USB-C port to apply the update. iMP says it will provide an appropriate cable to customers who need one, on proof of purchase. You'll also need a Windows PC environment to run the updater, as it's an .exe file.

Unfortunately, after you've done all that construction and updating, the Mini Arcade Pro presents one major problem: You have to look at it.

There are two ways to approach the Mini Arcade Pro's design ethos: its physical design and its graphic design. The former is pretty good! The finished unit is nicely evocative of the actual arcade cabinets of the 1980s and ‘90s, or more recent bar-top arcade mini cabs like the Evercade Alpha. Sure, building it around the Switch's widescreen display means digressing from the boxy 4:3 displays that many originals had, and the shrunken-down structure is a wholesale departure, but it still sits on your desk like a sense memory given form. The swooping arcs and angles of the ersatz rig hit all the right notes, while the eight-button layout and cherry-red handle of the joystick very much look the part.

The graphic design, though … hooboy. This is, bluntly, absolutely atrocious on multiple levels. The headline marquee juxtaposes two terrible fonts—a sort of jaunty Comic Sans-on-acid for “MINI ARCADE” and a blocky, italicized, faux-pixelated “PRO”—into an overly colorful mess that feels juvenile and childish, rather than retro. The side panels feature a quartet of layered arrows extending along the height and depth of the unit, an idea that could have a bit of simplistic ‘80s charm to it, but applied in slapdash fashion, with different widths to each arrow that make it look like badly pasted clip art. While the arrow's color order is consistent with the cabinet's face buttons—red, yellow, green, blue—that feels more like a happy accident than a deliberate choice. You've seen “graphic design is my passion” memes that actually have a better grasp of design than this.

Worst of all, though, is that the cabinet is practically dripping in AI slop imagery. Each side panel has a hallucination of nightmarish faces—I think they're faces—and distended hands; jagged teeth and what looks like bunched-up intestines, all grasping at impossibly-shaped gaming controllers and exploding out of some sort of apocalyptic meat grinder. Elsewhere, the main control panel and that already-blighted marquee have more malformed controllers, flying out of yet more explosions. Even if these elements had been applied with intent and drawn by an actual human—one who knew what a controller looks like or realized that internal organs don't typically leave the body for a gaming session—the aesthetic is far too busy, leaving this looking like a complete mess.

I reached back out to iMP to ask about its clear use of AI imagery for the Mini Arcade Pro. In response, a representative said: “Due to time constraints, the production team in China relied on various imagery for use on the outer marquee to hit production timelines; however, that is now under consultation and is due to be revised as part of a running change.”

A potential sliver of good news for future buyers, then. However, there's no word yet on when a revised design may enter production, what that design may be, or if it would be more AI slop.

If you can look past the dreadful aesthetics, or fancy redecorating it yourself (hey, it's an art project, too!), then the Mini Arcade Pro is at least decent fun to use.

The joystick feels especially delightful—nicely responsive and satisfyingly “clicky” as it moves around. Its metal shaft feels resilient, too. With only the one stick on the cabinet, it has to pull triple duty, though, with a hard toggle on the top right of the panel emulating the Switch's left thumbstick, D-pad, or right thumbstick. If you're sticking to arcade classics, you won't find much need to swap out of D-pad mode.

There is what looks like another maddening design fail, with the Switch's left shoulder buttons, L and ZL, positioned on the right of the Mini Arcade Pro's eight-button layout, with the right-hand R and ZR buttons to their left. However, this is actually a trick borrowed from other console arcade sticks, and it works surprisingly well for 2D fighters such as Ultra Street Fighter II. Capcom's classic series builds combos from light, medium, and heavy punches and kicks, which is best suited to a six-button layout. Played on a ‘regular' controller, those inputs usually extend from the four face buttons to the right-hand shoulder buttons. Here, the B, A, and ZR buttons, and the Y, X, and R buttons line up in rows, so the game plays just like it would on an actual cabinet. It's neat.

However, I wouldn't use the Mini Arcade Pro to play fighters competitively, even for low-stakes online play. While the joystick feels great, the rest of the inputs feel far from tournament grade. I occasionally noticed overly sensitive “twitchy” controls, where pressing a button once—to select a game in a compendium title, for instance—would result in multiple inputs, even without that aforementioned Turbo feature activated. It's not a consistent problem, but annoying when it happens.

As the Mini Arcade Pro is only designed for one player, it feels better suited to arcade puzzlers, shooters, and side-scrolling beat-'em-ups anyway. The Golden Axe games in Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Collection, the entire roster of Capcom Beat-'Em-Up Bundle, and Namco Museum's Splatterhouse all fared well, as did classics Pac-Man and Galaga. Shooters in particular are where that Turbo feature does come in handy—hold down the Turbo button, then the input you want to apply the feature to, and blast away to your heart's content. Repeat the process to turn the feature off.

That's probably not enough to salvage this for most players, though. Unless you're using your Switch or Switch 2 to near-exclusively play old-school games—or at least old-school style games, like Streets of Rage 4 or Terminator 2D: No Fate—then this has limited appeal. Coupled with the hoops you need to jump through to update it for Switch 2 usage and the abysmal imagery slopped all over the thing, the Mini Arcade Pro isn't so much retro as it's better left in the past.

In 2024 we emitted more greenhouse gases into our atmosphere in a single year than any year before it. The increase from 2023 was small—0.8 percent—but still, global emissions continue to rise, despite science telling us we should have bent the global emissions' curve downward by 2020.

The emissions in our atmosphere are at work, heating the planet, acidifying our oceans, and leading to climate-fueled disasters: heat waves, fires, flooding, droughts, and storms. For some climate impacts, devastation can be followed by the painstaking work of recovery. But for many natural systems, like our tropical coral reefs, the stress we are putting on them is reaching the realms of permanent decline and ultimate collapse.

This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.

As we near 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming—the globally agreed upon limit of the Paris Agreement—we risk triggering tipping points. They are slumbering giants that in their healthy state dampen stress and cool the planet; systems with thresholds that, once crossed, lead to irreversible shifts, from dampening to amplifying stress, causing loss of resilience of the planet and accelerating the pace of change.

Once tipping points are crossed, there is also a nontrivial risk of dangerous cascades, where the first set of tipped systems have knock-on effects on other tipping elements, pushing them across their thresholds, triggering a domino sequence, and increasing further the likelihood of Earth drifting away from its stable state.

Many tipping elements are now well-known: the Amazon rainforest, the Greenland Ice Sheet, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (or AMOC). But exactly at what level of warming they will cross their tipping points is still being investigated and narrowed down by science.

For some systems though, we have much higher certainty. Tropical coral reef systems—the rainforests of the ocean—are famous for their biodiversity, unimaginable richness in color and life, being the breeding ground for a myriad of fish species, and providing livelihoods for over 400 million people. They are also likely to be one of the first ecosystems we lose completely to climate change if we do not see a step change in action to reduce our emissions.

This would be devastating. In addition to their unique environmental significance, coral reefs are the ecological basis for massive sectors of the global economy, including tourism and fisheries, worth tens of billions of dollars. They are also vital natural protection for many coastal regions against storms and erosion.

The largest coral reef in the world and the richest marine ecosystem on Earth—the Great Barrier Reef in Australia—experienced another mass bleaching event in 2025. Bleaching is when corals expel the algae in their systems and turn a ghostly white. Corals are animals living in symbiosis with the algae, and while they can survive bleaching events, they need time to recover. Yet the Great Barrier Reef also experienced one in 2024. And in 2022, 2020, 2017, and 2016.

Because our emissions have continued at unprecedented rates over the past decade, we've moved very quickly from a place where corals had time to recover from horrific stress to next to no time at all. A year without bleaching is becoming the exception rather than the rule.

Recent science estimates 50 percent of the Great Barrier Reef has been lost to climate change. We're witnessing a collapse in real time from biodiversity-rich hard-coral systems to slimy, diversity-poor, soft algae systems.

In 2026, as we move toward another El Niño cycle and ocean temperatures in the Pacific rise, it's very likely there will be another mass bleaching event at the Great Barrier Reef, pushing it further into a state of decline and closer to a brink from which it will not be able to recover. This places an enormous responsibility and creates great incentives for global action away from danger, for the Australian government, which is now vying to host the 2026 UN climate negotiations.

However, it's not a problem for just one country's government. In 2023-24 the world's coral reefs experienced a very rare global bleaching event. Bleaching events are usually localized to a region that is experiencing a heat wave. But for only the fourth time in history, though the second in a decade, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced a global bleaching event, because the entirety of our world's oceans are just too hot.

Our Earth's resilience to change is fast being worn by our escalating transgressions of its livable boundaries. Our work at the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research to map these boundaries shows that six of nine have already been exceeded.

The world now urgently needs global action that matches the assessment of global risk. Global emissions from fossil fuels need to be reduced by over 5 percent per year, to reach zero by 2050. This is necessary in order to have a chance of deviating from unmanageable outcomes. But this will not be enough. In addition to the global transition away from fossil fuels, we also—urgently—need to transition our food systems from a carbon source to a carbon sink and by 2050 be permanently removing more than 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year through different technologies.

The hard reality of our situation is that, even in an ideal future in which we do all we can from this moment on to combat rising temperatures, we could still lose our coral reefs. They are the canaries in the coal mine for the climate crisis. Our best and last chance to save them is to act now, with all the resources we can bring to bear to try to save these precious ecosystems for the generations to come.

Gemini Live is the more conversational, natural language way of interacting with the Google Gemini AI bot using your voice. The idea is you chat with it like you would chat with a friend, interruptions and all, even if the actual answers are the same as you'd get from typing your queries into Gemini as normal.

Now, about a year and a half after its debut, Gemini Live has been given what Google is describing as its “biggest update ever.” The update makes the Gemini Live mode even more natural and even more conversational than before, with a better understanding of tone, nuance, pronunciation, and rhythm.

There's no real visible indication that anything has changed, and often a lot of the responses will seem the same as before too. However, there are certain areas where you can tell the difference that the latest upgrade has made—and so here's how to make the most of the new and improved Gemini Live.

The update is rolling out now for Gemini on Android and iOS. To access Gemini Live, launch the Gemini app, then tap the Live button in the lower right hand corner (it looks vaguely like a sound wave) and start talking.

Gemini Live can now add more feeling and variation to its storytelling capabilities—which can be useful for history lessons, bedtimes for the children, and creative brainstorming. The AI will even add in different accents and tones where appropriate, to help you distinguish between the characters and scenes.

One of Google's own examples for how this works best is to get Gemini Live to tell you the story of the Roman Empire from the perspective of Julius Caesar. It's a challenge for Gemini that requires some leaps in perspective and imagination, and to use tone and style appropriately in a way that Gemini Live should now be better at.

You don't have to restrict yourself to Julius Caesar or the Roman Empire either. You could get Gemini Live to give you a retelling of Pride and Prejudice from the perspective of each different Bennett sister, for example, or have the AI spin up a tale of what life would have been like in your part of the world 100, 200, or 300 years ago.

Another area where Gemini Live's new capabilities make a noticeable difference is in educating and explaining: You can get it to give you a crash course (or a longer tutorial) on any topic of your choosing, anything from the intricacies of human genetics to the best ways to clean a carpet. You can even get Gemini Live to teach you a language.

The AI can now go at a pace to suit you, which is particularly useful when you're trying to learn something new. If you need Gemini Live to slow down, speed up, or repeat something, then just say so. If you've only got a certain amount of time spare, let Gemini know when you're chatting to it.

As usual, be wary of AI hallucinations, and maybe don't trust that everything you hear is fully accurate or verified. If you're wanting to learn something like how to rewire the lighting in your home or fix a problematic car engine, double-check the guidance you're getting with other sources, but Gemini Live is at least a useful starting point.

One of the new skills that Gemini Live has with this latest update is the ability to speak in different accents. Perhaps you want the history of the Wild West spoken by a cowboy, or you need the intricacies of the British Royal Family explained by someone with an authentic London accent. Gemini Live can now handle these requests.

This extends to the language learning mentioned above, because you can hear words and phrases spoken as they would be by native speakers—and then try to copy the pronunciation and phrasing. While Gemini Live doesn't cover every language and accent across the globe, it can access plenty of them.

There are certain safeguards built into Gemini Live here, and your requests might get refused if you veer too close to derogatory uses of accents and speech, or if you're trying to impersonate real people. However, it's another fun way to test out the AI, and to get responses that are more varied and personalized.

Founders in the Seattle area are busy building software for health insurance, AI model tuning, construction processes, and hospital operations. 

Our latest Startup Radar spotlights four early stage tech startups in the region: Amera, Clara, Oiyko, and Specbook.

Read on for brief descriptions of each company — along with pitch assessments from “Mean VC,” a GPT-powered critic offering a mix of encouragement and constructive criticism. 

Check out past Startup Radar posts here, and email me at [email protected] to flag other companies and startup news.

Founded: 2025

The business: Targeting health insurance payers with software that automates the claims processing workflow. Its product converts medical claim documents into structured data, replacing manual entry and supporting newer payment models. Amera is generating revenue, working with multiple plan administrators, and participating in the Fall 2025 cohort at Y Combinator.

Leadership: CEO Deep Kapur previously worked at Microsoft, Protocol Labs, and most recently Rupa Health. Co-founder Louise Tanski was also at Rupa Health and co-founded Moonshot Brands (acquired by Infinite Commerce).

Mean VC: “You're solving a real pain point in healthcare admin, and early revenue plus YC traction suggest you're on the right track. The key will be proving your structured data actually drives measurable cost or accuracy improvements — not just faster paperwork.”

Founded: 2022

The business: A self-described “AI-powered operating room orchestration” platform for hospitals. Clara aims to be like Apple's “Find My” app, but for patient care, helping hospital staff quickly locate equipment and people. The company has raised around $375,000 and is working with a lab at the University of Washington on a non-clinical pilot. 

Leadership: CEO Melinda Yormick has more than a decade of operating room experience as a registered nurse and nurse manager. She was named a 2025 “Up and Comer” at the PSBJ Healthcare Leadership Awards. Co-founder Aaron Cooke was previously a senior software engineer at Viome and Julep.

Mean VC: “The problem is clear to anyone who's worked in a hospital, and your background gives you credibility where it counts. But unless you can tie this to patient outcomes or hard ROI, hospital budgets may treat it as a luxury.”

Founded: 2025

The business: Helps companies fine-tune AI models using their own data, enabling employees to add business-specific context. The company is participating in WTIA's startup accelerator. 

Leadership: Co-founders Saptak Sen and Suchi Mohan first met at Microsoft in India in 2001. Sen, the CEO at Oiyko, was most recently a vice president at Tetrate and head of container integrations at AWS. Mohan was a senior technical program manager at Microsoft for more than four years.

Mean VC: “Fine-tuning with business context is a sharp idea, especially as enterprises grow wary of generic AI outputs. Still, you'll need to show how you differ from the wave of enterprise LLM tooling coming from giants and better-funded peers.”

Founded: 2025

The business: Builds AI agents for industrial and civic projects that can quickly analyze data and perform tasks such as design reviews and reviewing construction submittals. Specbook is working with large construction companies and municipalities. Contracted revenue is in the six figures. 

Leadership: Co-founders Gordon Hempton and Wes Hather co-founded Outreach, the Seattle-based sales software company. More recently they launched two startups: B2B sales software company FullContext and virtual work platform Spot. 

Mean VC: “Digitizing construction reviews and civic workflows is overdue, and six-figure contracts suggest you're solving a real pain. To scale, you'll need to prove your product can handle diverse requirements without slipping into custom consulting.”

Holiday cheers turned to jeers directed at Amazon last week as some film fans were surprised by a gutted version of the Christmas classic “It's a Wonderful Life” on Prime Video.

The 1946 film stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a man who learns the value of his life after seeing what the world would be like without him.

In a story on Christmas Day, the New York Post called out Amazon for airing a “butchered” version of the film that is shorter than the original and missing a key sequence that the newspaper calls “the movie's emotional core.”

Unsuspecting viewers who clicked on the cut copy vented on social media, calling it “an abomination” and “sacrilege.”

A search of the movie title on Prime Video on Monday morning brought up a few options, including a black and white version, a color version, and one clearly marked “abridged.” That version included a description which read, in part, “a condensed ending but still contains all the sweetness and Christmas wonder.”

It's unclear if Amazon recently added the “abridged” labeling on that version. We reached out to the company for comment and will update when we hear back.

The Post story, and an accompanying video (below), detailed how the missing sequence factors into the film as a distraught George Bailey — who wishes he'd never been born — sees how his hometown of Bedford Falls devolves into a corrupt, neon-lit “Pottersville” without his existence. 

The sequence helps Bailey realize how important his simple life is in shaping the fate of many, and his despair turns to joy.

The existence of the shorter version of the movie is not the work of Amazon editors, but rather is rooted in the copyright history of the film, as the Post points out.

A 2022 University of Connecticut law school blog post explains how the film fell into the public domain when its distributor failed to renew its copyright in 1974. This lapse helped turn “It's a Wonderful Life” into a holiday classic because TV stations freely aired the movie for decades around Christmas without paying royalties.

In the 1990s, Republic Pictures regained control of the movie when it argued that it held properly maintained rights to two underlying elements: the original short story “The Greatest Gift,” by Philip Van Doren Stern, and the musical score by Dimitri Timokin.

Television networks were directed to stop playing “It's a Wonderful Life” without permission or the payment of royalties. The Post reported that the abridged version appears to be a workaround that removes the “Pottersville” sequence to avoid infringing on a key portion most directly adapted from the short story.

A Kirkland, Wash.-based tech company is suing its New York-based acquisition advisor, alleging it was pushed into a $5.2 million acquisition that was supposed to generate $1 million annually but has instead required ongoing cash infusions just to stay afloat.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of SmarTek21, a longtime technology consulting services firm, accuses TGP GP Management of “egregiously defective due diligence” in its May 2025 acquisition of IT Avalon, another U.S.-based tech consulting company.

According to the complaint, Tortuga Growth Partners, a New York-based private equity firm, acquired a minority stake in SmarTek21 in 2024. Its affiliate, TGP GP Management, a management and acquisition advisory firm, entered into an agreement to advise SmarTek21 on acquisitions and related matters.

TGP responded in a statement: “TGP strongly disputes the allegations in this complaint and stands by the comprehensive due diligence process conducted for the IT Avalon acquisition.”

The lawsuit was filed Dec. 18 in King County Superior Court in Seattle by Totem Lake Investments II, the majority owner of SmarTek21. Totem Lake Investments is led by SmarTek21 CEO Alkarim Lalji. The suit seeks at least $6 million in damages, plus punitive damages and other relief.

According to the complaint, TGP almost immediately began pressuring SmarTek21 to acquire IT Avalon, as a complementary business that would augment SmarTek21's existing model and diversify its customer base. The suit says TGP represented that IT Avalon would generate at least $1 million annually in free cash flow, before other benefits from the combination.

The complaint alleges that TGP's principal Ashray Prasad dismissed concerns raised by SmarTek21 executives about IT Avalon's deteriorating finances in the days before closing. According to the suit, Prasad repeatedly called Lalji urging him to close the deal — placing many of these calls while Lalji was undergoing treatment for a serious medical condition.

The lawsuit alleges TGP pursued the IT Avalon acquisition out of “enthusiasm for transaction fees, publicity, and the appearance of quick deal-making.”

According to the suit, IT Avalon's revenue had been declining since 2022, and its operating income had dropped significantly, while its vendor relationships deteriorated.

TGP structured the deal so that any working capital shortfall would be offset against future earnout payments to IT Avalon's sellers. But that proved worthless, the suit alleges, because IT Avalon had almost no chance of hitting the revenue targets that would trigger those payments.

In its statement, TGP disputed these claims.

“IT Avalon is a strong technology business with valuable client relationships,” it said. “The combined entity now benefits from an expanded client base, talented personnel, and a robust pipeline of opportunities. We intend to vigorously defend against these baseless claims.”

The dispute illustrates the complicated nature of private equity-led technology roll-up strategies, in which smaller companies are combined to create larger platforms.

The acquisition of IT Avalon in May was the second in six months for SmarTek21, following its earlier combination with Retro Rabbit, a South Africa-based product design firm, according to a press release by Tortuga Growth Partners announcing the IT Avalon deal at the time.

“We are building a category-defining platform,” said TGP's Prasad, who is also a member of SmarTek21's board of managers, in the press release. He added that the completion of the second acquisition over that time frame reflected “the momentum behind SmarTek21's growth.”

According to the company's public materials, SmarTek21 provides product engineering and enterprise software services to Fortune 250 clients in industries including financial services, healthcare, and telecom. It says it has more than 650 associates across the U.S., India, and South Africa.

IT Avalon, founded in 2012, provides technology consulting services to clients in financial services, healthcare, gaming, and hospitality. The May press release announcing the deal described the company as having a 95% client retention rate.

Lalji and SmarTek21 did not respond to requests for comment. See the full complaint below.

It was a normal day when Jay Gibson got an unexpected notification on his iPhone. “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone,” the message read.

Ironically, Gibson used to work at companies that developed exactly the kind of spyware that could trigger such a notification. Still, he was shocked that he received a notification on his own phone. He called his father, turned off and put his phone away, and went to buy a new one.

“I was panicking,” he told TechCrunch. “It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”  

Gibson is just one of an ever-increasing number of people who are receiving notifications from companies like Apple, Google, and WhatsApp, all of which send similar warnings about spyware attacks to their users. Tech companies are increasingly proactive in alerting their users when they become targets of government hackers, and in particular those who use spyware made by companies such as Intellexa, NSO Group, and Paragon Solutions.

But while Apple, Google, and WhatsApp alert, they don't get involved in what happens next. The tech companies direct their users to people who could help, but at which point the companies step away.

This is what happens when you receive one of these warnings. 

You have received a notification that you were the target of government hackers. Now what? 

First of all, take it seriously. These companies have reams of telemetry data about their users and what happens on both their devices and their online accounts. These tech giants have security teams that have been hunting, studying, and analyzing this type of malicious activity for years. If they think you have been targeted, they are probably right. 

It's important to note that in the case of Apple and WhatsApp notifications, receiving one doesn't mean you were necessarily hacked. It's possible that the hacking attempt failed, but they can still tell you that someone tried. 

In the case of Google, it's most likely that the company blocked the attack, and is telling you so you can go into your account and make sure you have multi-factor authentication on (ideally a physical security key or passkey), and also turn on its Advanced Protection Program, which also requires a security key and adds other layers of security to your Google account. In other words, Google will tell you how to better protect yourself in the future. 

In the Apple ecosystem, you should turn on Lockdown Mode, which switches on a series of security features that makes it more difficult for hackers to target your Apple devices. Apple has long claimed that it has never seen a successful hack against a user with Lockdown Mode enabled, but no system is perfect. 

Mohammed Al-Maskati, the director of Access Now's Digital Security Helpline, a 24/7 global team of security experts who investigate spyware cases against members of civil society, shared with TechCrunch the advice that the helpline gives people who are concerned that they may be targeted with government spyware.

This advice includes keeping your devices' operating systems and apps up-to-date; switching on Apple's Lockdown Mode, and Google's Advanced Protection for accounts and for Android devices; be careful with suspicious links and attachments; to restart your phone regularly; and to pay attention to changes in how your device functions.

			Have you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. 


What happens next depends on who you are. 

There are open source and downloadable tools that anyone can use to detect suspected spyware attacks on their devices, which requires a little technical knowledge. You can use the Mobile Verification Toolkit, or MVT, a tool that lets you look for forensic traces of an attack on your own, perhaps as a first step before looking for assistance. 

If you don't want or can't use MVT, you can go straight to someone who can help. If you are a journalist, dissident, academic, or human rights activist, there are a handful of organizations that can help. 

You can turn to Access Now and its Digital Security Helpline. You can also contact Amnesty International, which has its own team of investigators and ample experience in these cases. Or, you can reach out to The Citizen Lab, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto, which has been investigating spyware abuses for almost 15 years. 

If you are a journalist, Reporters Without Borders also has a digital security lab that offers to investigate suspected cases of hacking and surveillance. 

Outside of these categories of people, politicians or business executives, for example, will have to go elsewhere. 

If you work for a large company or political party, you likely have a competent (hopefully!) security team you can go straight to. They may not have the specific knowledge to investigate in-depth, but in that case they probably know who to turn to, even if Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab cannot help those outside of civil society. 

Otherwise, there aren't many places executives or politicians you can turn to, but we have asked around and found the ones below. We can't fully vouch for any of these organizations, nor do we endorse them directly, but based on suggestions from people we trust, it's worth pointing them out. 

Perhaps the most well known of these private security companies is iVerify, which makes an app for Android and iOS, and also gives users an option to ask for an in-depth forensic investigation. 

Matt Mitchell, a well-regarded security expert who's been helping vulnerable populations protect themselves from surveillance has a new startup, called Safety Sync Group, which offers this kind of service. 

Jessica Hyde, a forensic investigator with experience in the public and private sectors, has her own startup called Hexordia, and offers to investigate suspected hacks. 

Mobile cybersecurity company Lookout, which has experience analyzing government spyware from around the world, has an online form that allows people to reach out for help to investigate cyberattacks involving malware, device compromise, and more. The company's threat intelligence and forensics teams may then get involved.  

Then, there's Costin Raiu, who heads TLPBLACK, a small team of security researchers who used to work at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Group, or GReAT. Raiu was the unit's head when his team discovered sophisticated cyberattacks from elite government hacking teams from the United States, Russia, Iran, and other countries. Raiu told TechCrunch that people who suspect they've been hacked can email him directly.

What happens next depends on who you go to for help. 

Generally speaking, the organization you reach out to may want to do an initial forensic check by looking at a diagnostic report file that you can create on your device, which you can share with the investigators remotely. At this point, this doesn't require you to hand over your device to anyone. 

This first step may be able to detect signs of targeting or even infection. It may also turn out nothing. In both cases, the investigators may want to dig deeper, which will require you to send in a full backup of your device, or even your actual device. At that point, the investigators will do their work, which may take time because modern government spyware attempts to hide and delete its tracks, and will tell you what happened. 

Unfortunately, modern spyware may not leave any traces. The modus operandi these days, according to Hassan Selmi, who leads the incident response team at Access Now's Digital Security Helpline, is a “smash and grab” strategy, meaning that once spyware infects the target device, it steals as much data as it can, and then tries to remove any trace and uninstall itself. This is assumed as the spyware makers trying to protect their product and hide its activity from investigators and researchers.  

If you are a journalist, a dissident, an academic, a human rights activist, the groups who help you may ask if you want to publicize the fact that you were attacked, but you're not required to do so. They will be happy to help you without taking public credit for it. There may be good reasons to come out, though: To denounce the fact that a government targeted you, which may have the side effect of warning others like you of the dangers of spyware; or to expose a spyware company by showing that their customers are abusing their technology. 

We hope you never get one of these notifications. But we also hope that, if you do, you find this guide useful. Stay safe out there.

When Kevin Hartz's security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren't good enough. His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.

In 2024, they launched Sauron — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.

The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham's startup lab Atomic, and Hartz's investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.

But a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode —  a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.

After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He's spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers' homes.

The answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.

“We're in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You'll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone. All the different components — our concierge service, our AI software running on servers, our smart cameras — are building blocks coming together in a plan we just put in place very recently.”

Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “All the topics he was thinking about when starting Sonos were exactly the same topics we're discussing at Sauron.”

Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? Professional installation or DIY? Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.

The security problem 

Bouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people's homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people's minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.

His research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don't respond because they assume it's a false alarm.”

The company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern”  —  people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”

The product (that's still taking shape)

So what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.

“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They're good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”

The deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.

“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.

As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don't want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we're such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.

Timeline and business model

With fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.

“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it's because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we're showing progress and explaining how we'll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”

The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron's three founders, which include roboticist and engineer Vasumathi Raman. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”

But Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”

The surveillance state questionFacial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you're in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it's you and you're allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.

License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that's a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.

Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron's approach. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We're looking at it from the opposite angle — we're a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”

Sauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco's Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.

“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We've seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don't think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron's path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)

It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.

For now, Bouvat-Merlin says he's focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he's putting in place. “I don't demand that people trust me  — I want to show them why they should.”

The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:ycombinator.com","GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder: What it means for you","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46422412","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:44:46 GMT","

This is the only line I was looking for. I stopped buying on Steam sometime ago because I realized I was just renting licenses. GOG is the only major storefront where I feel like I actually own the product. As long as offline installers remain a core tenet, I don't care who owns the company. That said, it helps that it's someone returning to their roots rather than a private equity firm looking to strip-mine the assets.

What is a company/individual if not a reseller if they're selling Steam keys? You cannot sell Steam keys without being Steam or the developer itself, and not be called a ""reseller"". Or what sites are you referring to here, stuff like Humble Bundle where you get Steam keys with the bundles?

reply

Real stores sell steam keys because they are selling directly from the developers. Steam is actually nice (or preempting monopoly talk, depending on your view) in that it allows that (I think there are limits, but IIRC rather generous)

reply

You can sync up your Steam wishlist (it's a little weird to setup but once you figured it out it works).I almost never buy games directly from steam anymore, there's almost always someone else with a discount on steam keys.And sometimes GOG has the best deal!

> Is GOG financially unstable? No. GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year. In fact, we've seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.I'm really happy to hear this, as I always feared their hard stance on no-DRM would scare off publishers and developers, but seems that fear might have been overstated. This year I personally also started buying more games on GOG than Steam, even when they were available on Stream. Prior to 2025 I almost exclusively used Steam unless it wasn't available there, but now GOG is #1 :)Glad it's moving in even better directions, thank you Team GOG!

Companies with strong financial performance don't tend to use words like ""encouraging"". That is the language you get from companies that are in trouble and hoping for recovery.Talking about people's enthusiasm for their mission is just straight up dodging the question itself.

But while gog was talking, Valve was actually doing. Building an actual Linux client. Making multiplayer actually work. Not to mention all the work they've done with Proton and upstreamimg graphics drivers.I hope gog succeeds. I just value Linux gaming support over not having DRM. It's kinda a idealist vs realist stance for me.

I picked up a bargain bin CD ROM of this game in 1996 and it works under dosbox as well as it ever did. Which is to say mostly ok but sometimes hilariously crashy. I think what needs to happen for us to spend another 30 years crafting overpowered plate mail is for there to continue being good emulators for the mid 90s DOS environment.

reply

CD Project makes great games, but gaming industry is all-or-nothing. They already had colossal flop at their previous release. If another flop happens shutting down GOG is clearly would be on a table as a cost cutting measure.

reply

reply

You have to give kudos to CD PROJEKT for not just abandoning the game after a bad launch (which is what every other major studio would have done in its place) but patiently fixing problems and constantly adding content over 5 years to get to the state it is in today. And the game has no online requirement, no multiplayer, no microtransactions. Just one paid expansion which added a ton of new content. Rare to see this behavior in the industry today.

reply

Afaik CDPR doesn't make many games. If one flops, that might be the end of them. I don't see abandoning a game as a valid option for them from a financial perspective. Makes much more sense to fix the issues and sell more.

Third option is to ensure the downloader runs under proton, which I think it does but haven't tried.

The Wall Street Journal's Sean McLain reported Sunday on the recent Humanoids Summit in Mountain View, California held earlier this month. McLain seems to have come away with the impression that makers of robots are worried they've oversold a technology that, well, sucks. So far anyway.Sure, Elon Musk is promising a robot army, and there's now some kind of robot butler being preordered by rich people who are expected to pay $20,000 essentially just to help train it. What the optimists perhaps haven't considered is something the Chinese government has already spoken on: there's a danger that if this hype produces actual retail products, the creators of those products are on the verge of creating millions of unsatisfied customers, and will have accomplished nothing other than filling landfills with mountains of human-shaped e-waste. One cautious robot executive Kaan Dogrusoz, CEO of Weave Robotics, told the Journal, “There's a lot of great technological work happening, a lot of great talent working on these, but they are not yet well defined products.” Then Dogrusoz invoked a piece of consumer tech history that should have robot optimists rethinking their lives: “Full bipedal humanoids are the Newtons of our times,” Dogrusoz told the Journal.The Apple Newton MessagePad was a portable computer product marketed in the mid-90s at a time when Steve Jobs didn't control the company. It was buggy, and became a huge public joke. When Steve Jobs assumed control of Apple again, he discontinued it. As Wired wrote in 2013, “The Newton wasn't just killed, it was violently murdered, dragged into a closet by its hair and kicked to death in its youth by one of technology's great men.” Releasing a bunch of worthless Newton-level bipedal robot duds into the world is a possibility that should have tech company CEOs worried. A good metaphor for such a corporate disaster might be someone teleoperating a humanoid robot such that it delivers a groin kick to its operator. If only there were a freshly viral video in my feeds that could help me illustrate this… 

another robot highlight for 2025: man wearing humanoid mocap suit kicks himself in the balls[image or embed]

Here are some other choice quotes the Journal took down at the summit: Ani Kelkar, a McKinsey partner told the Journal that when a company spends $100 on robot deployment in a workplace, $20 goes to the robot, and the other $80 goes toward stopping the robot from injuring people. “We're doing a big extrapolation from watching videos of robots doing laundry to a butler in my house that can do everything,” Kelkar warned in the Journal's article.Isaac Qureshi, the CEO of a company called Gatlin Robotics, whose flagship product at the Summit was able to scrub a brick wall if it was teleoperated by a person in a VR headset said, “Slowly, we're going to teach the Gatlin robot more things, like starting with dusting, surface cleaning, trash bins and then the toilet.”Pras Velagapudi, the CTO of Agility Robotics said, “We've been trying to figure out how do we not just make a humanoid robot, but also make a humanoid robot that does useful work.” He might be onto something.Robot executives have spoken. Don't buy a humanoid robot, folks. It cannot do anything useful for you, but it can clobber your groin.

We're not ending 2025 without a last bit of awful news: Wildlife officials are sounding the alarm about a dangerous brain illness spreading among deer in North America.

Over the last several weeks, officials in Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Manitoba, Canada, have reported cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in new areas. The mad cow-like illness can spread easily between deer and has a 100% fatality rate. In addition to its ecological impact, the infection may also pose a potential health threat to humans, particularly hunters.

Prions are perhaps the strangest pathogen around.

They're the misfolded form of a normally harmless protein found in the brain (also confusingly called the prion protein). When a rogue prion encounters its regular counterpart, it somehow forces the latter to misfold as well, almost like a zombie infection. Over time, this amassing army of bad prions will destroy the animal's brain, leading to death.

The ‘Molecular Devils' That Cause the Most Fatal Diseases Ever Known

Prion diseases have been found in many animals, humans included. The most infamous one might be bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow disease. Much like mad cow, deer and related cervids afflicted with CWD will experience neurological symptoms like confusion, trouble walking, and rapid weight loss (the titular wasting).

CWD was first discovered in the U.S. over 50 years ago, though it took longer for scientists to determine that prions are behind it. And it's been spreading further across North America ever since. Cases have now been documented in at least 36 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces.

In mid-December, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission reported three cases of CWD in hunter-harvested white-tailed deer. These cases were found in Grant and Sevier counties, where CWD had never previously been detected (the first ever case in Arkansas was reported in 2016). Last week, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources confirmed its first positive CWD test result of a deer in La Crosse County. That same week, the Manitoba Natural Resources and Indigenous Futures reported five new cases of CWD, two of which were in previously undetected areas (the first CWD case in Manitoba was documented in 2021).

The increasing presence of CWD in North America is concerning for several reasons.

CWD can be transmitted relatively easily, compared to other prion diseases like mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common, but still rare, prion disease that affects humans. CWD can spread directly through contact with infected animals and bodily fluids like saliva, and might also spread through prions left behind in the environment by urine or feces. That means CWD has the potential to cause sustained outbreaks of illness in both free-ranging and captive deer populations.

There's also the scary, if still only theoretical, danger of transmission to humans. Mad cow has sparked outbreaks of CJD in humans, caused by people eating contaminated beef. The possibility exists that a similar event could happen with hunters who eat CWD-tainted meat. Last year, for instance, a team of researchers argued in a case report that two hunters who died from CJD may have been infected after consuming CWD-infected deer.

Prion Disease Is Spreading in Deer. Here's What We Know About the Risk to Humans

These cases have not been conclusively tied to CWD, and other scientists have been skeptical about the connection. Experimental studies have also provided mixed evidence for any transmission risk to people, at least for now.

Still, CWD remains a real and growing threat to deer, as well as the human industries that rely on them. So even if CWD never directly harms us, it could cause a serious ecological disaster—large outbreaks could devastate local deer populations, which in turn would affect other species in the area, or cause the closure of deer farms, a $7.9 billion industry. To that end, Wisconsin officials have extended an existing baiting and feeding ban in La Crosse County (baits can attract large populations of deer to an area). Hunters, meanwhile, are advised against eating deer that are untested, or confirmed to have CWD.

Millie Bobby Brown may have found her next Netflix project. Percy Jackson has cast its big villain for season 3. Plus, Ralph Macchio believes the Karate Kid universe needs a reset. To me, my spoilers! 

In conversation with Deadline, James Cameron confirmed he's producing a remake of Fantastic Voyage, and is currently “working with a director on a new script” he thinks “could move forward in a big way this coming year.”

I've been nurturing that for a while. I hope to get that going this coming year. I'll be producing it. I'm working with a director right now with a new script. So, yeah, we're gonna do it.

According to a recent report from The InSneider (via World of Reel), Millie Bobby Brown is in talks to star in Joe Cornish's Dark Park at Netflix. The story concerns “a group of young people who dare to enter a haunted amusement park, where every ride could be their last.”

Ralph Macchio told People he believes The Karate Kid franchise “needs a reset” after the poor synergy of the Cobra Kai finale and Karate Kid: Legends “colliding at the same time.”

There's been discussions. Between the series and the movie with Jackie Chan, all that colliding at the same time, I just think there needs to be a reset. And then finding the perfect way to launch, because the fan base — it's never gone away. It hasn't gone away since 1984. But you want to service and be organic, and be true to the integrity of the characters. So that's always a challenge once you are on the long game.

According to a recent report from insider Daniel Richtman (via World of Reel), Jordan Peele is “being eyed” to direct a “mysterious project” at Marvel. If the rumor is true, it's speculated Peele could be next in line to direct the company's troubled Blade reboot or even a film introducing the Midnight Sons team of monster-fighting heroes.

Scientists are proposing a new source of fuel for potential alien life on Europa: Radioactive elements seeping out of rocks and into the moon's ocean, where it could generate enough energy to support living organisms.

Research presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in New Orleans puts forth a new model for the potential for life on Jupiter's icy moon. The new model suggests that rocks themselves, rather than the moon's internal heat, may be the reason for Europa's possible habitability.

NASA's Europa Clipper mission, which launched in 2024, may be able to put this new theory to the test when it reaches the Jovian system in 2030.

Ngoc Tuan Truong, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, was inspired by extreme habitats on Earth when he developed this new theory, according to Science. On Earth, tiny organisms on the ocean floor rely on chemical reactions rather than sunlight for energy. The process is known as chemosynthesis, and it may be happening on Jupiter's moon as well.

Europa has a vast, saltwater ocean beneath its icy shell, with more than twice the amount of water in all of Earth's oceans combined. The presence of all this water, a key ingredient for life, has made Europa a prime target in the search for habitability beyond our own world.

Unlike neighboring ocean moons Ganymede and Callisto, Europa's ocean is probably in direct contact with warm rock at the seafloor, according to NASA. If radioactive material seeps out of those rocks over time, its natural decay would release heat and break apart water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen ions. Microbial life would then be able to snack on the energy in those ions, sustaining its existence, the new paper suggests.

For the study, Truong and a team of researchers modeled the concentrations of three radioactive isotopes found in Europa's ocean: Uranium-235, Uranium-238, and potassium. The researchers then estimated the number of ions that would be released from the decay of those isotopes and found that it was enough to support quite a lot of life. The ions could feed around 1 septillion cells, or the biomass of 1000 blue whales.

Scientists had previously assumed that Europa's rocky interior was producing enough heat to fuel life. A recent study, however, revealed that the moon's icy crust is much thicker than previously believed, making it unlikely that the planet produces enough internal heat for life to evolve. Radioactive elements provide an alternative explanation for how Europa could produce energy to fuel primordial life.

US states across the Northeast, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley are facing weather warnings today as a bomb cyclone reaches peak intensity.

The storm brought blizzard conditions to parts of the Midwest on Sunday, particularly Michigan, where there are currently more than 100,000 power outages due to heavy snow and high winds. As the expanding system tracks northeastward toward Canada, the National Weather Service expects these conditions to move eastward into the Great Lakes, where local snowfall totals could reach 2 feet.

“As this system reaches peak intensity early this morning, blizzard conditions can be expected especially over the central Great Lakes,” the NWS stated Monday. “Meanwhile, a mix of snow sleet and freezing rain will spread quickly through New England before warmer air changes the wintry mix to all rain during the day.”

When the barometric pressure of a storm system in North America falls 24 millibars within 24 hours, it is considered a bomb cyclone. This process, called “bombogenesis,” typically occurs when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass. That's exactly what happened this weekend when an Arctic cold front encountered a record warm spell across the central and southern U.S.

The rapid pressure drop creates a strong pressure gradient, causing air to rush toward the storm's center. This fuels intense winds and precipitation. As such, bomb cyclones are more hazardous than your average winter storm and can deliver hurricane-force winds, blizzard-level snowfall, dangerous wind chills, and coastal flooding.

As of Monday morning, more than 30 million Americans are under winter weather alerts across the upper Midwest and Northeast, and blizzard warnings remain in effect for parts of northern Iowa and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Wind advisories stretch from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast, with gusts of up to 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour) expected.

These conditions could snare post-holiday travel plans as ice and blowing snow make roadways treacherous and reduce visibility.

Forecasters expect the cyclone to move quickly into southeastern Canada. By Monday evening, much of the snow across the upper and central Great Lakes should taper off, but lake-effect snow will continue to affect some areas downwind, according to the NWS.

These lake-effect snows should linger through at least Wednesday morning as another storm—an Alberta clipper—spreads light snow across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Tuesday. The cyclone will continue to send strong and gusty winds into the entire eastern U.S. as it tracks north, with snow showers possible through Wednesday morning across interior New England.

As we close out the year with some wild winter weather, forecasters urge those in the cyclone's path to stay alert, refrain from traveling, and prepare for rapidly changing conditions. With most of the season still ahead, similarly powerful systems could return in the months to come.

Hardware aim assist: your mousepad moves to make up for your slow or poor aiming.

What do you do if you are so good at video games that playing against family and friends becomes drained of all its entertainment value? If you are Nick, at the Basically Homeless YouTube channel, you combine woodworking, hardware hacking, and software shenanigans to enhance your friendly foes with a slick, mechanized, mousepad-driven aim-assist system that imparts expert-level headshot skills. The system uses a computer vision model to monitor the screen and identify targets, and then moves the mousepad underneath the mouse to zero in on the perfect shot. In practice, this worked so well and so transparently that some of Nick's opponents began to think they had elite-level aiming skills.

The finished moving mousepad aim assist system works great, but how was it actually created? Nick is the kind of person who thinks on his feet, so even before finalizing the design, he got busy routing a big hole in his bamboo-topped table, a few inches smaller than the sizable opaque white glass mousepad that had already been chosen.

He would pick a few different transport solutions before settling on using the gantry and controller board from an Xdraw A4 drawing board to move the mousepad physically. Thankfully, that choice still fits with his earlier decisions regarding the table routing and the mousepad.

Hacking to gain control of the drawing board revealed that it had a commonplace GRBL controller, so it wasn't too complicated to command and control this stripped-down device. With this determined, Nick could get on with fitting the mousepad movement mechanism, stripped from the drawing board, under the table, and attaching the mousepad on top. A little bit of 3D printing was required to make the perfect inserts/spacers for the mousepad fitting and sliding mechanism.

The next step would have been mightily complicated had it not been for the availability of the YOLO-based computer vision model. Nick's software implementation used this model to monitor the screen. Based on what was happening on the screen, the computer vision system would calculate the required motion and send serial commands to the mousepad's GRBL-driven motion rig. This way, when a target was detected within a generous radius of the crosshair, the mechanized gantry swiftly adjusted the aim to become a laser-accurate headshot.

One of the best illustrations of how slickly the mechanical mousepad's aim assist worked was provided by Olivia, towards the end of the video. To start, she believed she was naturally good at eSports gaming. However, Nick quietly disabled the aim assist “for science,” and his opponent's mood turned a little sour, accusing him of cheating… So, he turned it back on in the spirit of good sportsmanship.

Federal warrants name four suspects who posed as U.S.-based developers using company hardware.

The FBI has published a public wanted notice naming four individuals accused of operating as fraudulent remote IT workers on behalf of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), tying the group to identity theft, wire fraud, and the alleged theft of more than $900,000 in virtual currency from U.S. companies. The FBI has issued a $5 million reward for information ""that leads to the disruption of financial mechanisms of persons engaged in certain activities that support North Korea.""

According to the FBI, arrest warrants were issued on June 24, 2025, in the Northern District of Georgia. Prosecutors allege the defendants used stolen or falsified identities to obtain remote software engineering and IT roles, then abused their access to company systems and digital wallets during 2022. The bureau says the stolen funds were subsequently laundered through cryptocurrency transactions.

The FBI's wanted notice lists aliases, dates of birth, language abilities, and travel links to countries including the United Arab Emirates and Laos, describing how the accused allegedly presented themselves as legitimate remote workers while operating on behalf of the DPRK.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice, in a related operation, said that they searched 29 suspected “laptop farm” locations across 16 states, seizing dozens of financial accounts and websites used to support the scheme. Investigators described laptop farms as physical locations in the U.S. where company-issued systems are delivered, powered on, and connected to corporate networks, allowing overseas workers to control them while appearing to be domestic.

In 2022, the FBI said that North Korea ""has dispatched thousands of highly skilled IT workers around the world"" who ""in many cases misrepresent themselves as foreign (non-North Korean) or U.S.-based teleworkers, including by using virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private servers (VPSs), purchased third-country IP addresses, proxy accounts, and falsified or stolen identification documents"" in a bid to evade detection for as long as possible.

It's not difficult to see why crypto-linked companies are frequent targets. Access to internal repositories, signing keys, and wallets can be far more valuable than traditional payroll fraud, particularly when attackers maintain long-term access under the guise of legitimate employment. By issuing a public wanted notice, the FBI is piling pressure on both the operators and the support networks that make the schemes viable.

Prosecutors allege handwritten notebooks detailed hundreds of optimized manufacturing steps developed over five years.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Last week, South Korean prosecutors indicted multiple individuals in a case alleging that a former Samsung engineer leaked advanced DRAM manufacturing process data to China's ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), shedding light on how leaked trade secrets may have accelerated China's push into 10nm-class memory. Now, it has come to light (via SemiAnalysis) that the engineers in question allegedly took note of detailed critical manufacturing steps in handwritten notes taken over five years.

The former Samsung engineer was arrested for offences under the Unfair Competition Prevention Act and the Industrial Technology Protection Act for allegedly passing along information on Samsung's sub-10nm DRAM process before CXMT began mass production of comparable memory in 2024, two years earlier than expected. This may have caused trillions of losses in Korean Won for both Samsung and South Korea. Meanwhile, CXMT is expected to capture as much as 15% of the market thanks to its advanced memory products.

The formerly employed Samsung Electronics engineer is accused of bypassing internal digital security systems by manually recording sensitive process data in handwritten notes. These notes are believed to have covered more than 600 individual manufacturing steps, including detailed parameters such as gas flow ratios, reactor pressures, and photoresist settings used during critical lithography and deposition stages.

 




It's estimated that Samsung invested roughly 1.6 trillion KRW over five years to develop its 10nm DRAM technology. The core allegation is that CXMT was able to bypass much of that learning curve and, by extension, cost by calibrating its own production equipment using the stolen process “recipes,” adjusting them as needed to account for differences in toolsets and materials. This would not have eliminated the need for validation work, but it could have dramatically reduced the time and cost required to reach acceptable yields at advanced nodes.

As a result of this, CXMT has emerged as China's most advanced DRAM producer over the past several years, beginning volume shipments of 17nm DRAM in 2022 and moving into 10nm-class production in 2023, a transition that surprised many, given the technical difficulty of scaling DRAM without access to leading-edge lithography tools. Prosecutors argue that Samsung's trade secrets played a direct role in this rapid progression, including in CXMT's subsequent work on HBM stacks.

While companies have invested heavily in digital access controls, monitoring, and data loss prevention systems, handwritten notes remain difficult to track or audit. Investigators say the accused engineer exploited this gap by memorizing and transcribing process flows, which is virtually impossible to police effectively.

Australia will significantly tighten regulation of dietary supplements with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) starting in 2027, under a reclassification by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Products with more than 50 mg of vitamin B6 will then be available only in pharmacies, and those with more than 200 mg will require a prescription. The move follows numerous reports of sometimes severe sensorimotor polyneuropathies after long-term high-dose supplementation.

Concerns are also growing in Germany that B6 supplements are underestimated. “A restriction of over-the-counter [OTC] availability would be desirable here as well,” said Hans-Jürgen Gdynia, chief of neurology at m&i Fachklinik Enzensberg, a specialist clinic and rehabilitation center located in Füssen, Germany. Preparations with B vitamins are “advertised in pharmacies, on television, and online as beneficial for the nerves.” The problem, he said, is that many people “equate over-the-counter with harmless.” That belief is deceptive.

The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has recommended since last year that adults and adolescents aged 15 years or older should not consume more than 0.9 mg of vitamin B6 per day from supplements. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2023 lowered the tolerable total daily intake for adults from 25 mg/d to 12 mg/d. Amounts above that are considered unsafe. For children, upper limits range from 2 mg/d to 11 mg/d depending on body weight.

Despite these very low recommendations, the German market still offers numerous products with 25-50 mg of vitamin B6 per capsule or tablet, both as single-ingredient products and as part of high-dose B-complex vitamins. Investigations of supplements for toddlers and preschoolers, as well as earlier analyses of sports supplements sold online, show that some products contain vitamin B6 levels that exceed age-appropriate reference values or the presumed safe upper limits many times over.

How many people actually take such products long term is unknown. Studies usually assess overall supplement use rather than targeted B6 supplementation. Clinicians observe, however, that many patients combine multiple products and thereby unknowingly reach high total doses.

That high B6 intake can be neurotoxic has been known for decades. As early as 1983, a team in The New England Journal of Medicine reported sensory neuropathy from chronic high-dose pyridoxine use, with symptoms often improving after the supplement was stopped.

What is new is how often such cases now occur. At this year's German Society for Neurology congress, Gdynia and colleagues presented a case series of eight patients who developed polyneuropathy due to B6 hypervitaminosis. “And these are only patients who presented to our neurology clinic over a 4-year period,” he emphasized. “So it's not as rare as you think.”

The affected individuals had taken OTC products — mostly B-complex vitamins, often for “general strengthening,” in some cases on a physician's recommendation. “Extremely high-dose preparations aren't even necessary. The hypervitaminosis in all cases arose from products bought at a pharmacy or drugstore,” Gdynia said.

Given this clustering, Gdynia calls for changes in diagnostic practice. “In polyneuropathy, you should always check the B6 level,” he said. Many cases are overlooked because histories do not specifically ask about supplements and B6 is often not measured in unclear neuropathies.

In his view, this diagnostic gap should be reflected in the guideline “Diagnostics in polyneuropathies” of the German Society for Neurology, which currently recommends measuring vitamin B6 only in certain cases, not generally. “This belongs in routine diagnostics,” he emphasized. The reason: B6-induced neuropathy is potentially reversible. “After stopping the preparation, many cases improve gradually, provided the damage has not lasted too long.”

In Australia, approximately 250 cases of B6-induced polyneuropathy were reported before the regulatory decision. The majority involved people who had taken 100-200 mg/d or more over extended periods.

At very high doses, a polyneuropathy can occur in about 1%-4% of those chronically exposed — still rare but by no means negligible, said Peter Crack, a neuropharmacologist at The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, in comments to the Australian Science Media Centre. “Even moderate but sustained intakes (eg, 50 mg/d over months to years) have been linked to sensory neuropathy in susceptible individuals.”

“Neuropathy is almost never seen with dietary intake alone and occurs almost exclusively in people taking supplements at doses well above physiological needs,” Crack emphasized.

It is widely believed that water-soluble vitamins are harmless because excess amounts are excreted. “I also learned in medical school that only fat-soluble vitamins are stored and can be dangerous,” Gdynia said. “But too much vitamin B6 can obviously cause significant harm in the body.”

Awareness of hypervitaminosis is “not sufficiently developed in either the general population or the medical community.” Patients rarely volunteer information about self-purchased supplements, and physicians often do not specifically ask about supplements in the workup of polyneuropathies.

Following the new EFSA assessment, the BfR proposed in 2024 that supplements for adults contain only 0.9 mg of vitamin B6 per daily dose. Even stricter limits apply for children. However, these values are not legally binding. That explains why products with 20-50 times higher contents are still available in drugstores and online shops.

Gdynia therefore argues for clearer regulation — similar to Australia. “The dangers posed by hypervitaminosis are not sufficiently highlighted. We need more education and stricter rules.”

 December 29, 2025  

John Read is increasingly alarmed by the number of people in the UK who remain on antidepressants for years. 

For the psychologist and professor of clinical psychology at the University of East London's School of Childhood and Social Care, the scale of long-term use represents what he calls a “medical disaster” that demands urgent attention.

“We have this false belief that has been sold to health professionals and the public that a chemical imbalance is behind depression, of which there's no evidence,” Read told Medscape News UK.

“Patients are now using antidepressants for longer and longer. Why is that? It's largely due to withdrawal. When people try to come off them, they can't. This was a well-kept secret until recently, but which the drug companies knew about since 1990s.” 

Concerns about widespread antidepressant use and the over-medicalisation of mental health in the UK are not new. What has changed is the scale.

In 2024-2025, 8.89 million patients in England were prescribed antidepressants, according to NHS data. Prescribing has risen steadily for years and is expected to continue increasing over the next decade.

Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland report similarly high rates. 

There is also growing recognition of the impact that long-term use can have on patients. Around half of people prescribed antidepressants are now considered long-term users, defined as taking them for at least 1 year — a proportion that has more than doubled in recent years. Reports have estimated that 2 million people in England have been taking antidepressants for 5 years.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) “might need to be taken for at least 6 months after the remission of symptoms, but should be reviewed regularly.”

Dr Joanna Moncrieff, professor of critical and social psychiatry at University College London and a consultant psychiatrist in the NHS, has long challenged the widespread use of antidepressants and argued for greater emphasis on non-medical support.

She told Medscape News UK that rising long-term use reflects several interconnecting pressures in the system. 

“We're prescribing more and more antidepressants and patients are meant to be reviewed every few weeks,” she said. “But it takes a lot of medical time to review people regularly, so patients get left on them.”

“Another reason for long-term use is that they're not effective. People don't get better, they wait for them to work and when they don't, they go to their GP and the dose is put up.” 

Read agrees, adding that responsibility for mental health is too easily handed over to medication. 

“We like quick fixes,” he said. “If we're upset about something, and we're given a choice to try and understand why we're upset or to take a pill, many of us will go for a quick fix. When you combine this with GPs short on time and withdrawal effects, it's a recipe for a disaster.” 

Not all experts see long-term use as a problem. Dr Philip Cowen, professor of psychopharmacology in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford, England, said there are multiple reasons for rising antidepressant use — and not all are negative. 

“There's a tendency for people to stay on antidepressant treatment longer, and the evidence that long-term treatment prevents relapse is actually quite good,” he told Medscape News UK.

“Other factors include the effectiveness of SSRIs in anxiety disorders, which are as common as depression. Finally, there is extensive use of low-dose amitriptyline for neuropathic pain, and this gets counted in as antidepressant treatment, thereby inflating the figures.”

Cowen points to the ANTidepressants to prevent reLapse in dEpRession (ANTLER) trial, a randomised controlled study of long-term maintenance treatment in primary care. The trial found that patients who discontinued antidepressants faced a higher risk of relapse and withdrawal symptoms, but also that a substantial proportion were able to stop without relapsing. 

Beyond relapse risk, a growing body of research suggests long-term antidepressant use can lead to severe and sometimes debilitating withdrawal symptoms. The Royal College of Psychiatrists acknowledges that some people experience symptoms that can last months or more than a year.

“In surveys of people, only about 1%-2% are ever told that they need to come off slowly — and that's medical neglect as far as I'm concerned,” Read said.

“Unfortunately, then the doctor tells them the withdrawal effects is relapse and that they need more drugs rather than providing support and helping patients to get off them slowly. Our own research found that among people who report withdrawals, half of them classify them as severe.”

Withdrawal symptoms can be physical and emotional, including dizziness, flu-like symptoms, insomnia, aches and pains, and anxiety. They may appear weeks or months after stopping medication and can be mistaken for a return of the original condition, particularly when psychological symptoms dominate. 

Cowen, however, said other recent evidence suggests withdrawal is “not an important problem for most people.”

For Read, a key turning point came with the publication last year of the Maudsley Deprescribing Guidelines, which set out how to safely reduce or stop antidepressants, benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and z-drugs.

It was a breakthrough, he said, because “British doctors see Maudsley as the Bible.” 

“The task now is to get the information to doctors and to start providing dedicated withdrawal services. The key things are to come off slowly and for a patient to be informed about what's going on. You can end up in a psychiatric hospital from withdrawal effects if you don't understand what is happening.” 

Moncrieff recently helped establish a small clinic in London, within the NHS, to support withdrawal from antidepressants and benzodiazepines. The service offers gradual dose reduction alongside peer support. 

“What surprised me is that we were seeing local referrals, referred by a local GP, not particularly people known to have problems coming off,” she said.

“Most had tried but had great difficulties and we had to do it pretty slowly. Our experience so far suggests problems with withdrawals are widespread.” 

Moncrieff believes that the ideal model would be embedded in primary care, potentially led by a pharmacist with support from a counsellor, alongside a second-tier service for more challenging cases. 

“But for me, the most important thing to do is stop people from getting onto drugs in the long-term. If we could just use them in the short-term, it would help a lot.”

She suggested incentivising doctors to actively review and taper treatment — an approach that has been effective for other medications.

“We need to give incentives and doctors time to properly review people,” she said. “We need to get rid of the 6 months idea and, if we have to use them, to taper people off as soon as they're feeling better or if it's not working.”

Cowen urged GPs to follow NICE guidance, which recommends exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy, and other non-drug interventions as first-line treatment for most people with depression. 

Read said he is encouraged by the growing use of social prescribing, where GPs direct patients to community activities such as volunteering or choirs. 

“We as the public go to the GP for psychological or social problems, partly because there's nowhere else to go,” he said. “They have 10 minutes and there's not a lot they can do except prescribe medicines.”

“They need more time and better information, and for psychologists and counsellors to be embedded within a GP's practice. But quite a few doctors are doing social prescribing now and I think that's an important milestone because not everyone needs a therapist or medication. Time is a great healer.” 

No relevant conflicts of interest were reported.

In a multinational phase 3 trial, a single dose of zoliflodacin, an oral, first-in-class spiropyrimidinetrione antibiotic, was non-inferior to that of ceftriaxone plus azithromycin in treating uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhoea and had a similar safety profile.

""[The study] data suggest a potential role for zoliflodacin as an effective oral treatment option for uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhoea,"" the authors wrote.

""Development of an effective oral regimen is an important advance that augments gonococcal treatment options.

This study was led by Alison Luckey, Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, Geneva, Switzerland. It was published online on December 11, 2025, in The Lancet.

The open-label design may have influenced outcomes and could have contributed to an imbalance in missed test-of-cure visits between the two groups. Despite targeted outreach, women and adolescents were underrepresented, limiting the generalisability of the findings to these populations.

Patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) had more vertebral fractures, particularly biconcave vertebral fractures, than those with primary osteoporosis.

""Our findings highlight the diagnostic relevance of analysing VFx [vertebral fracture] morphology in the work-up of bone fragility,"" the authors wrote. ""Incorporating this parameter into existing diagnostic pathways may help reduce diagnostic delays, prevent misclassification as primary osteoporosis, and guide more appropriate therapeutic decision-making in this high-risk population,"" they added.

This study was led by Gaetano Paride Arcidiacono, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. It was published online on December 10, 2025, in Osteoporosis International.

The study's small sample size may have limited generalisability. Age and sex differences between the two groups may have influenced the results. The mechanism underlying biconcave fracture morphology in SM remains unclear.

Open access funding was provided by Università degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

In patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis treated with rituximab, risk factors for relapse differed by treatment phase; musculoskeletal involvement was associated with increased odds of relapse during the maintenance phase, and elevated immune markers were linked to increased odds of relapse after treatment withdrawal.

“[A]mong patients with AAV [ANCA-associated vasculitis], markers of inflammation and immune reconstitution are associated with disease relapse within 3-6 months during the period of observation off treatment after completion of a regimen to maintain remission. These data support monitoring of these laboratory tests at regular intervals to help identify patients with AAV at risk for relapse after withdrawal of treatment,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Ellen Romich, MD, Division of Rheumatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. It was published online on December 18, 2025, in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

The clinical trial setting involved selectively enrolled patients. Defining the on-treatment and off-treatment phases may have been challenging. Missing data for some laboratory values, especially CD19 -positive B-cell measurements, limited the ability to include a single quantitative measure of B cells.

The study received funding from Arthritis Research UK (now Versus Arthritis), Roche/Genentech, and the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium, which was supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Science and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. The study was supported by the Penn Vasculitis Center.

Only 31% of patients with prostate cancer receiving radiation therapy had a successful CT simulation on the first attempt, while more than half required multiple scans on the same day and nearly 17% had to be rescheduled for another day. Receiving both written and verbal instructions and written instructions only was associated with a higher first-attempt CT simulation success rate than verbal instructions alone.

“This study underscores the critical role of effective patient education and preparation in achieving successful prostate cancer CT simulations,” the authors wrote emphasizing that “addressing gaps in communication, improving clarity and consistency in instructions, and exploring innovative educational approaches” can enhance the success rate of simulations.

This study, led by Karishma George, Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, was published online in Advances in Radiation Oncology.

Limitations included the modest sample size and single-center design, which limited generalizability of the findings, a poor capture rate of the bladder fullness score and lower than planned statistical power.

This study received funding support from the PROSE program. Two authors reported receiving financial support from the PROSE program. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

Among 670,003 commercially insured US adults, only 7.3% adhered to cervical cancer screening guidelines between 2013 and 2021; most were either overscreened (61.6%) or underscreened (31.1%).

The findings suggest that “targeted strategies are needed to improve adherence, de-implement unnecessary care, and address disparities in adoption of evolving screening guidelines,” the authors concluded.

This study, led by Michelle B. Shin, PhD, MPH, School of Nursing, University of Washington in Seattle, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

Key limitations were the exclusion of uninsured populations, potential coding errors in the database, and imperfect race and ethnicity classification, which may have affected the generalizability of the findings.

This study was funded by the University of Washington Population Health Initiative and the University of Washington School of Nursing Research Intramural Funding Program. One author reported receiving nonfinancial support from Intuitive Surgical-Educational outside the submitted work. Another author disclosed receiving grants from the National Cancer Institute and the US CDC outside the submitted work. No other disclosures were reported.

Futbol W's Cristina Alexander and Ali Krieger, along with Natalia Astrain, discuss Trinity Rodman's slide from 8th to 37th in ESPN FC Women's Rank. (0:54)

Timing is everything in life -- and in awards voting, including our ESPN FC Women's Rank.

This time of year always produces plenty of questions around voting for soccer awards, and there's one being asked in full force this year: How is it that the U.S. women's national team -- winners of four World Cups, the reigning Olympic champions (for a record fifth time) and No. 2-ranked team in the world -- doesn't have more representation at the top of these year-end lists for best players?

The framing of the question is Americentrism, sure, and the reality of the landscape is that it remains Eurocentric. Combine that with a year when the USWNT's best forwards from yesteryear were all largely absent, and it starts to explain the absence of Americans from the current conversations around the world's best players, including ESPN's top 50.

Seven Americans made the Women's Rank list, but none within sniffing distance of the claim to being the world's top player. Emily Fox, in the oft overlooked position of fullback, is the top-ranked American at No. 23 after playing a crucial role in Arsenal's UEFA Champions League triumph in May -- a European tie-in in itself, by no coincidence. Fox was also the highest-ranked American in the final Ballon d'Or voting, where she finished 25th in the rankings.

How is it that such a talented, deep and still relatively dominant team doesn't have a player ranked among the top five or 10 players in the world in any of the awards, including ESPN's top 50?



ESPN FC Women's Rank names the 50 best players of 2025, as chosen by an expert panel of coaches, GMs and experts from around the world. See the full list here!

One could take aim at the voters for their potential faults and biases. Voters usually favor stars and especially goal scorers, who were the primary absentees for the USWNT this year. There are undeniable biases toward access in voting for any of these awards, and the NWSL and top leagues in Europe are the most accessible.

I was on the panel for ESPN's list, obviously, and I have been a voter on the Best FIFA award mostly for over a decade. For the Best FIFA award, specifically, the stage at which journalists, coaches and captains get to vote is only after a committee puts forth a small group of names. I'll never forget voting in 2014 when, for me, Kim Little -- the NWSL MVP -- was the best player in the world but wasn't even an option on the ballot. ESPN's ballot, however, allowed write-ins if the ""short list"" of 300 players missed anyone.

Voting tends to hinge on which big international tournaments happen in a given year -- and which countries get to participate. For the Americans, they usually need a World Cup or Olympics to rise to the top of these rankings. Megan Rapinoe was the last American to win the Ballon d'Or, in 2019, after she practically levitated at that World Cup to win the Golden Boot, Golden Ball and a winner's medal.

Last summer's big tournament, of course, was the European Championship -- at least in the eyes of so many globally. Africa and South America hosted their own overlapping continental championships, but with far less global commercialism and fanfare -- even if they had just as much drama. (Brazil beating Colombia 5-4 in a shootout after an eight-goal thriller through 120 minutes was the game of the year.)

It comes as no surprise, then, that Europe would dominate again in awards season -- ludicrously so when looking at FIFA's Best XI, which is composed entirely of players from Spain and England -- the two finalists at Euro 2025. For ESPN FC Women's Rank, Spain led the way with nine players, and England followed with eight.

Futbol W's Cristina Alexander and Ali Krieger, alongside Natalia Astrain, discuss Emily Fox as the highest-ranked USWNT player in ESPN FC Women's Rank.

But let's be clear: This is not a zero-sum conversation. Spain and England have world-class players. Spain, as the reigning World Cup champion, continues to produce players whose mastery on the ball and advanced tactical understanding can wow even the most casual observer. Spain fields a whole starting lineup of world-class players.

The USWNT can say the same -- sort of. The transitional state of the national team is a huge factor in players' global rankings right now. For the first time since ESPN launched its top 50 ranking, no Americans made the top 20 -- but the USA's seven players on the list is right behind England's total. The USWNT has world-class talent, but the more established names have been absent, while the rising stars of that next generation are still staking their claims.

Forwards Sophia Wilson (No. 5 on our list last year) and Mallory Swanson (No. 15 last year) did not play a single competitive game as they awaited the births of their respective first children. Trinity Rodman, the other forward from that dominant triumvirate that led the USWNT to Olympic gold in 2024, missed about half the year due to various injuries. Rodman still checks in at No. 37 in our rankings, which speaks to her impact when she is on the field, but she was No. 8 last year.

Point blank, those are three of the most obvious U.S. players who would capture global attention -- remember the worldwide voting pool isn't watching every minute of every game -- but their literal time on the field over the past year was significantly limited in one case and nonexistent in two others.

Smith, Swanson and Rodman finished fourth, sixth and ninth, respectively, in 2024 Ballon d'Or voting. Each player is in her prime and will be back in those rankings once they return to the field.

Also missing for most of the year was defender Naomi Girma, whom USWNT head coach Emma Hayes previously called ""the best defender I've ever seen,"" and who is widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the world (Ballon d'Or voting be darned). She was No. 2 on ESPN's list last year. Girma's time on the field was extremely limited in our voting window due to multiple calf issues, and it's the only reason for her absence.

Rose Lavelle also had arguably her best NWSL season to date but missed the first half of the year recovering from ankle surgery. Her play in the back half of the year warrants a ranking even higher than No. 32, where she ultimately landed on our countdown.

These absences also accelerated and intensified the most experimental year in the USWNT's 40-year history. Hayes handed out 27 first caps in her 30 games in charge. The past year was marked by stark rotation and experimentation, meaning that even some of the best USWNT players were not necessarily regulars. And they didn't need to be, because the Americans did not play a single game in an official competition in 2025.

There were still standouts, of course. Forward Alyssa Thompson leveraged MVP-level play with Angel City into a blockbuster summer transfer to Chelsea, where her profile could grow further along with her game. That was enough to earn her a spot at No. 43 on our list.

Midfielder Sam Coffey was a picture of consistency for the USWNT and the Portland Thorns. As one general manager told ESPN in our anonymous NWSL GM survey, if Coffey were Spanish, she would have been in the top five for the Ballon d'Or. Coffey checks in at No. 28 in our rankings this year.

Even if that hypothetical around a player being more appreciated in Europe sounds like a stretch, the state of timing for the USWNT cannot be ignored. The team's three biggest stars from the Olympics were largely absent from the recent awards voting window, and the team rotated a laundry list of players through friendly matches.

None of that, however, suggests that there is a shortage of talent for the USWNT. From the established likes of Coffey, Fox and Lavelle to the rising stars such as midfielder Lily Yohannes, there is world-class talent in red, white and blue. Fair or not, it might just take another standout World Cup in 2027 for the world to fully appreciate that.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

U.S. Men's National Soccer Team star Christian Pulisic is pushing back against online speculation linking him romantically to actress Sydney Sweeney.

The USMNST men's national team star addressed the rumor on social media, dismissing the claim.

“Fake news guys,” Pulisic, 26, wrote in the comments section of an Instagram post reporting on the rumor, “let's stop with the silly rumor”

He doubled down in an Instagram Story, pleading with outlets to cease spreading fake rumors:

“Please stop with the made up stories about my personal life,” he wrote, via X/Twitter. “Need to hold sources accountable it can affect people's lives.”

Pulisic is one of the most accomplished American men's soccer players of his generation 

After breaking through as a teenager at Borussia Dortmund, he became the youngest non-German to score in the Bundesliga and quickly earned a reputation for his pace, directness, and composure in big moments. 

His 2019 move to Chelsea marked a watershed for U.S. soccer, and he delivered, playing a central role in the club's 2020–21 Champions League triumph and becoming the first American to score in a Champions League semifinal. 

At the international level, Pulisic has been the driving force of the U.S. men's national team, which is entering its ninth year.

He has captained the side, led it to multiple CONCACAF Nations League titles, and consistently delivered in high-stakes matches, including the 2022 World Cup, where he scored the decisive goal to send the U.S. into the knockout stage. 

Now with AC Milan, Pulisic has revitalized his club career, with eight goals and two assists in 11 matches.

Fulham have their sights set on bringing U.S. men's national team forward Ricardo Pepi to Craven Cottage this winter, a report claims.

The Premier League outfit is in the market to bolster their attack during the January transfer window. Mexico national team talisman Raúl Jiménez, who is set to turn 35 in May, only has five goals to his name in 2025–26, while Rodrigo Muniz has been sidelined since November with a hamstring injury.

According to Daily Mail, Fulham view Pepi as an exciting reinforcement for Marco Silva's squad, one that would bring a spark of life to a frontline that has only scored two or more goals in four of the club's last 16 games.

The Cottagers were previously interested in the American last summer, while West Ham United made an offer a year ago. But he continues to make waves at PSV Eindhoven thanks to a red hot start to the season. Pepi has already found the back of the net 10 times in 21 appearances, on pace to shatter his previous personal-best production of 17 goals in a single campaign. 

The Dutch club is thought to value the 22-year-old at around $54 million, a price tag that could keep increasing should Pepi keep up his form into 2026. Fulham not only would have to splash some serious cash to snag his signature, but also convince the No. 9 to make the move to the England.

Pepi missed significant time last season due to a knee injury, keeping him sidelined for the majority of the USMNT's 2025 calendar year. His lengthy stay in the infirmary opened the door for Haji Wright and Patrick Agyemang to impress new boss Mauricio Pochettino instead.

Pepi's return to top form, though, gives Pochettino a welcome problem. Now the Argentine has a wealth of options up top to test out during the March international break against Belgium and Portugal. 

Folarin Balogun remains the frontrunner to be the Stars and Stripes' starting striker at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but the Monaco standout's backup is anything but certain. Growing interest from the Premier League, and even a potential transfer, could give Pepi the edge ahead of the other alternatives going into next summer's tournament.

- Sources: City in advanced talks for Bournemouth's Semenyo
- Man United deals to be agreed with Wilcox, says Amorim
- Arsenal 'actively looking' to sign players in January - Arteta

- Fulham are interested in signing USMNT and PSV Eindhoven striker Ricardo Pepi, according to The Daily Mail. Fulham boss Marco Silva is in the market for more firepower up front alongside Raúl Jiménez, 34, and Rodrigo Muniz, who is on his way back from injury. Pepi, 22, has scored nine goals so far this season and was a target for Fulham and West Ham United last summer. He is now the preferred option ahead of Fiorentina striker Moise Kean, but PSV value his transfer at around €40 million.

- Napoli have been heavily linked with a loan move for Real Madrid midfielder Franco Mastantuono, but Madrid have closed the door on any departure, according to Marca. Mastantuono, 18, only moved from River Plate for €45 million in the summer and has already become Los Blancos' second-youngest debutant in the Champions League and their fourth youngest goal-scorer in LaLiga history. Napoli had been enquiring about a loan deal as they seek midfield reinforcements, but their interest was quickly quashed before any concrete offer was made.

- Bournemouth are expecting a late bid to sign winger Antoine Semenyo from Liverpool, says The Telegraph. The Ghana forward has seemingly been destined for a move to Manchester City in recent days and wants his future resolved by Jan. 1, as he has a release clause of £65 million that expires in a few weeks. But Semenyo could still be a target for Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes and could have a big decision to make soon. Meanwhile, Bournemouth are set to replace Semenyo with Leicester City's Abdul Fatawu, 21, who is expected to be available for transfer at around £30 million, according to The Daily Mail.

- Tottenham Hotspur will be active in the January transfer window, and the club have been linked with a host of players. TEAMtalk says Spurs will attempt to beat the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid to the signing of Crystal Palace Adam Wharton, while Bayern Munich's Leon Goretzka is also a target as his contract expires in the summer. The Evening Standard suggests that Manchester City winger Savinho appears to be off limits, but lists other targets including Manchester City forward Omar Marmoush, FC Porto forward Samu Aghehowa, Juventus star Kenan Yildiz and Barcelona wantaway keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

- Barcelona are looking to find a new left-footed center back in January, with Manchester City reportedly willing to part with Nathan Aké for a fee of around €25 million, according to Sport. Ake, 30, hasn't played as much first-team football as he would have liked in recent weeks and wants to solidify his chances of playing for Netherlands at the 2026 World Cup. His ability to play at full back would be beneficial to Barcelona, but a number of English clubs are interested in him too.

Few sporting events outside the men's and women's World Cups generate as much digital curiosity as the FIFA Club World Cup, News.Az reports.

 Each year, when the top club champions from different continents meet to compete for a global title, search engines light up with questions, predictions, highlights, and debate. In recent seasons, the tournament has surged to the top of worldwide sports search trends, reflecting not only growing fan engagement, but also the shifting balance of power in world football.

This evergreen analysis explains why the FIFA Club World Cup commands such global attention, what makes it different from other tournaments, and how evolving formats, economics, and broadcasting trends are reshaping its future.

Why the Club World Cup creates a global search surge

Unlike domestic leagues or continental competitions, the FIFA Club World Cup brings together champions from multiple confederations. That means the best clubs from Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, North America, and Oceania compete in a single tournament. For many fans, it represents the closest equivalent to an international club “world championship.”

Search interest spikes for several reasons. First, the event creates rare matchups. Fans in Asia may see their champion face a European powerhouse. Supporters in Africa may watch their club compete against Copa Libertadores champions. These cross-continental contests rarely happen elsewhere.

Second, the stakes feel symbolic. Winning the tournament allows clubs to claim the title of “world champion,” reinforcing brand prestige, attracting sponsors, and enhancing global identity. For clubs outside Europe, the tournament offers a unique stage to command the world's attention.

Third, the tournament often takes place during periods when other competitions pause or slow down, making it a focal point in the global sports calendar. That timing adds to search behavior as fans look for dates, lineups, live streams, and historical context.

A tournament shaped by football globalization

The rise in search interest mirrors the globalization of football. European leagues have long attracted massive international audiences, but fans increasingly follow their local clubs alongside global giants. As audiences diversify, the Club World Cup becomes a shared stage.

For example, a club from Japan or Mexico may dominate searches in their region as fans follow their journey. At the same time, supporters worldwide track whether European champions can maintain their historical dominance. This layered interest makes the event unique among football competitions.

The tournament also highlights the widening commercial footprint of football. Clubs use the platform to expand fan bases, build brand loyalty, and secure international partnerships. These trends extend beyond match results; fans search for merchandising, ticketing, player profiles, tactics, and post-tournament reactions.

European dominance — and why it matters

Historically, European clubs have enjoyed significant success in the competition. The combination of financial resources, deep squads, elite coaching, and world-class infrastructure gives European champions an advantage. As a result, many finals have featured Europe against South America, with European teams increasingly securing victory.

This dominance fuels ongoing debate — and a major source of online search interest. Fans ask whether non-European clubs can break through. Analysts evaluate tactical differences, squad depths, and development pathways. Supporters from emerging leagues watch closely to measure how their teams compare on the global stage.

Even when results seem predictable, storylines thrive. Smaller clubs relish the opportunity to face global icons. Regional pride intensifies. And fans turn to search engines to follow every narrative twist.

Format evolution fuels curiosity

Another driver of global attention is the evolving structure of the FIFA Club World Cup. Over time, FIFA has explored expansion plans and format redesigns to accommodate more teams and increase competitive balance. Proposals for larger tournaments involving multiple clubs from each confederation have attracted intense discussion.

Fans search for details about qualification pathways, tournament expansion, scheduling, venues, and potential host nations. Speculation about new formats keeps the event in the global conversation even between editions.

Broadcasters and sponsors also closely monitor these changes. A larger tournament means greater commercial opportunity — more matches, more storylines, and more digital engagement. This anticipation feeds search trends as stakeholders seek updated information.

The economics behind the spectacle

Football today is deeply intertwined with economics, and the Club World Cup is no exception. Participation carries financial rewards that can significantly benefit smaller clubs and reinforce the business stability of larger ones. Prize money, sponsorship exposure, global brand visibility, and increased social media engagement all drive commercial value.

European clubs often treat the tournament as part of a broader global strategy. For others, it can be a transformational event — boosting revenue, attracting better talent, and strengthening league reputation. Financial analysts, journalists, and investors follow these dynamics closely, driving search demand for economic insights related to the tournament.

A digital-first global audience

The rise of streaming platforms has also played a role in increasing search volumes. Fans across continents increasingly rely on digital platforms instead of traditional broadcast channels. As a result, global audiences search for live stream links, subscription options, regional broadcast rights, and highlights.

Younger fans, who consume football content primarily through mobile devices, short-form clips, and social media, contribute to continuous online engagement. A single skill move, goal, or controversial referee decision can go viral, feeding a cycle of replays, reactions, and commentary.

This digital ecosystem supports the tournament's global relevance — and ensures that, during Club World Cup season, it remains high on trending search lists.

Why the tournament feels different for every region

For European fans, the Club World Cup often serves as a confirmation of supremacy. For South American supporters, it carries emotional weight — a chance to prove that continental giants still rival European powerhouses.

In Asia, Africa, and North America, participation itself is a milestone, symbolizing the progress of domestic leagues and investment in football infrastructure. Clubs representing these regions inspire national pride and a sense that local football is stepping onto the world stage.

Because the tournament means different things to different regions, search behavior varies accordingly. In some countries, fans search tactical breakdowns or transfer implications. In others, the focus is on national identity, pride, and continental representation.

Players, coaching, and tactical innovation

Another reason the Club World Cup dominates search trends is the level of football displayed. The competition showcases elite individual talent, sophisticated tactical systems, and high-intensity global matchups.

Fans follow stars, emerging prospects, and veteran leaders. They search for squad lists, injury updates, press conferences, tactical analyses, and player ratings. Coaching philosophies also receive global attention — especially when smaller clubs outperform expectations.

As sports analysis becomes more data-driven, fans increasingly search for statistics, heat maps, possession metrics, and expected-goals models. This analytical culture feeds the conversation long after the final whistle blows.

Global identity and soft power

Football is more than sport. It reflects culture, identity, and — in many ways — soft power. Hosting or winning the FIFA Club World Cup allows countries and cities to project a global image of modernity, infrastructure readiness, and sporting heritage.

Governments, tourism boards, and local businesses view the tournament as an opportunity to attract visitors and investment. Stadium projects, transportation upgrades, and urban development often accompany major football events. Coverage of these initiatives contributes to rising search activity.

The future of the Club World Cup

As FIFA continues exploring expansion and scheduling adjustments, the Club World Cup is likely to grow in both scale and significance. A larger field could make the tournament more unpredictable, draw even larger audiences, and deepen competitive balance.

However, future development will also require careful planning around player workload, domestic league schedules, and travel demands. These debates already shape public discussion — another reason the event remains highly searched worldwide.

An enduring feature of global sports culture

The FIFA Club World Cup sits at the intersection of competition, commerce, culture, and digital engagement. Every edition reinforces football's status as the world's most globalized sport — one in which clubs from six continents share a single stage, even if their financial and competitive realities differ.

The surge in search trends is not only about match results. It reflects curiosity about global football identity, international rivalry, continental pride, tactical innovation, and the evolving business of sport.

As fans continue to follow their favorite clubs beyond domestic borders, the FIFA Club World Cup will remain a centerpiece of the digital sports conversation — a global tournament where every pass, headline, and trophy lifts not just a team, but an entire footballing ecosystem into the global spotlight.

After winning the inaugural 2025 FIFA Club World Cup title, Chelsea are pressing on in the Premier League and European play hoping to add to the trophy case.

Competing in this year's Champions League while pushing for qualification to next year's European competition, the Blues are in a battle for a top five spot in the domestic standings.

A match against struggling Bournemouth could provide a boost up the table, but Andoni Iraola is not one to take lightly even if the Cherries are in a bad run of form.

The Sporting News brings you the latest Chelsea team news, injury updates, and more ahead of their meeting against Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge this week.

Below is the latest injury picture for Chelsea, including estimated return dates for those who are sidelined.

Lavia has a muscle issue that saw him remain on the sidelines until well after the November international break. Maresca hopes the injury is not serious, but a return in December at the earliest is the optimistic view.

Essugo arrived at Chelsea carrying a thigh injury following his loan return to Sporting CP from Las Palmas.

While there has been little confirmed reporting on his return, there has been recent speculation that he might be out until early 2026.

Colwill suffered an ACL tear in preseason and will miss the full campaign. The England international is still in the early stages of his rehabilitation. 

Ukraine international Mudryk has not been available for selection since December 2024 after failing a doping test.

Liam Delap has returned from his shoulder injury and is available as an option up front to spell Joao Pedro.

Alejandro Garnacho so far has outplayed Jamie Gittens on the left wing opposite the intrepid Neto on the right.

Formation: 4-2-3-1

Sanchez (GK)

James, Chalobah, Badiashile, Cucurella

E. Fernandez, Caicedo

Neto, Palmer, Garnacho

Neuer really misses having Müller at FC Bayern after having played together for 14 seasons…

Manuel Neuer and Thomas Müller are two names that are synonymous with Bayern Munich and Mia San Mia. Two absolute legends of the club, both Neuer and Müller have won everything there is to win together for both Bayern and the German national team it what has been a pair of incredibly storied careers that still are not done just quite yet.

Müller now plies his craft in MLS with the Vancouver Whitecaps and enjoyed a run to the MLS Cup finals in his first season abroad, having lost to Inter Miami in the final. He tallied a total of nine goals and four assists from thirteen appearances in the Whitecaps' run to the finals after having only just joined up with them midway through their domestic season following Bayern's involvement in the FIFA Club World Cup over the summer.

From the standpoint of Max Eberl and the rest of Bayern's front office, the door was open for Müller to stay at the club beyond the end of the Club World Cup, but the Raumdeuter felt it was time to make the switch and experience something else before it's too late. While it's hard to argue against that sentiment, Neuer still misses having his mate in Munich and at FC Bayern a great deal.

Speaking on the At Broski - Die Sport-Show recently, Neuer explained how it feels to no longer have Müller in and amongst the ranks of the German Rekordmeister after having played alongside one another at the club for fourteen seasons. “You can tell he's missing. He got along with everyone, he was this link between young and old. He did a lot with body language, he could connect with the players on a certain vibe because they immediately felt integrated,” Bayern's keeper stressed (as captured by Sky Sport).

While it was always going to become a reality at some point, it was difficult to imagine an FC Bayern team without Thomas Müller in it, but his impact lives on in the togetherness of the squad that currently exists. As Neuer alluded to, he was almost like the glue amongst the group, bridging the gap between younger and older players and helping everyone fully integrate at the club. Some players have had better times than others at FC Bayern, but one would be hard-pressed to find players that had successful periods at the club not mention how much Müller had a positive impact on them.

Pep Guardiola says Manchester City's title bid was conceived at last summer's Club World Cup which helped clear the ""fog"" surrounding the club.

City are tussling with Arsenal and Aston Villa at the top of the Premier League and they made it six wins in a row with a 2-1 victory at Nottingham Forest on Saturday.

Guardiola's side endured a torrid campaign by their standards last season as a run of four successive titles came to an end in disappointing fashion.

But the Spaniard described the summer tournament, which saw them go out in the last 16 to Al Hilal, as critical to change.

""Energy, energy, energy,"" he said. ""We lost it last season. We started to train better, compete better.

""After that we can talk about three at the back, four at the back, wingers or full-backs - that is all b*******.

""We needed energy and then you have a good environment. When we went out to Al Hilal, it wasn't the fact that we didn't win but that we were so good there.

""It was then holidays so I said, 'OK, go on holidays' but I was p***** off because we were good there, good with the guys training, good with the competition.

""The place we were in, Boca Raton in front of the beach. Everyone was happy. Made a lot of dinners, a lot of talks, what we have to do next season.

""We wanted to extend it, just to live that.

""I think there, after talking with Pep (Lijnders) and James (French), Manel (Estiarte), Hugo (Viana), Txiki (Begiristain), we turned around and said something changed. Something (you can feel).

""It doesn't mean you are going to win but that you are able to recognise the team. Now it is eight victories in a row.

""It is not easy but compete in a way we do. We have to improve, absolutely, but this mindset is better.""

""Energy can go down but energy can go up. Never in our lives is it the same.""

Guardiola, whose long-term future remains in the air, admits he has also been re-energised.

""It's not about you or you or you, it was something... something was in the fog in Manchester, surrounding our training centre. We missed something,"" he said.

""It is not switching on or off (energy). Results help. The methodology. And Pep Lijnders, James (French), Kolo Toure.

""New players, I want to help them. When you've got the same players it is, 'ah, tired'. But new players you think, 'ah, how is this guy?', and try to analyse. The energy comes from there.

""Energy can go down but energy can go up. Never in our lives is it the same.

""In professional or personal, you'll never be happy all the time but never sad all the time. You have to realise why, to realise what we missed, to come back.""

Gianni Infantino was elected Fifa president in 2016

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has defended the cost of World Cup tickets by saying they reflect the public's ""absolutely crazy"" demand for next summer's tournament. 

The pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) describing it as ""scandalous"".

Group stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, while the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is £3,119.

But Infantino says the level of demand far outstrips supply.

""We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,"" Infantino said at the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday.

""So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.

""In the almost 100 years of the World Cup, Fifa has sold 44 million tickets in total. So, in two weeks we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. Imagine that. This is absolutely crazy.""

Fifa introduced a small number of ""more affordable"" £45 tickets for all 104 matches following criticism of its pricing structure after the initial release of tickets.

""We have listened to feedback and this new category is the right thing to do"", a Fifa official close to the discussions told BBC Sport. 

Infantino says the money raised through ticket sales will be reinvested into the global game, although he did not specify an amount. 

""What's crucial is that the revenues that are generated from this are going back to the game all over the world,"" said Infantino. 

""Without Fifa there would be no football in 150 countries in the world. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup which we reinvest all over the world.""

FIFA president Gianni Infantino gave an emphatic defense of the heavily criticized 2026 World Cup ticket prices, citing the unprecedented demand as the main reason behind the sky-high prices. 

In some instances, ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup are five times more expensive than in the previous tournament in Qatar in 2022, prompting swift and severe backlash from fans all over the world. Speaking at the World Sports Summit in Dubai, Infantino gave the reasoning behind the high prices, making a massive revelation.

“We have six to seven million tickets on sale,” Infantino said via BBC Sport. “And in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests. So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.

“In the almost 100 years of the World Cup, FIFA has sold 44 million tickets in total. So, in two weeks we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. Imagine that. This is absolutely crazy.”

The high prices will make going to stadiums across the United States, Canada and Mexico during the World Cup for a once in a generation event simply unaffordable for fans. FIFA's response to the backlash was to open a new, restricted tier of tickets at $60 for every game. 

Infantino revealed they were aware of the critics which he described as “feedback” and that the cheaper tier was the “right thing to do.” Still, the rest of the eye-watering priced tickets, plenty of which reach four figures, remain unchanged. 

It's no secret that FIFA will get a massive piece of the World Cup ticket pie. With the 2026 World Cup being the first 48-team tournament, on top of the astronomical prices, the money generated from ticket sales will be unprecedented. 

Speaking on the matter, Infantino made sure to detail where FIFA will be reinvesting the revenue from its handsome slice. 

“What's crucial is that the revenues that are generated from this are going back to the game all over the world,” Infantino said. “Without FIFA there'd be no football in 150 countries in the world. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup which we reinvest all over the world.”

Only time will tell if Infantino's repeated promise to help the sport develop all over the world becomes a concrete reality. What's certain is that the economic revenue generated from World Cup ticket sales could make a significant impact.

Irish embassy officials gave thousands of pounds worth of World Cup 1994 tickets to Irish fans left stranded and ticketless in Florida after a British travel agent suddenly went bust in order to prevent what they feared risked becoming a ""riotous situation"".

The concerns are outlined in State Papers released to the National Archives of Ireland, which said the decision needed to be made to protect the long-admired public image of Irish football fans.

When Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland team qualified for USA '94 - a result fans hope will be repeated by the current team next summer - they were placed in a group with Italy, Mexico and Norway.

While Ireland qualified from the group after a historic Ray Houghton-inspired 1-0 win over Italy in New Jersey's Giants' Stadium, a 2-1 defeat to Mexico in Orlando and a 0-0 draw with Norway back in New Jersey, the team were ultimately knocked out in the second round after a 2-0 defeat to the Netherlands in Orlando.

The tournament is remembered just as fondly for the actions of Irish fans, who were praised globally for their large numbers, creative ways of getting more tickets than expected, and friendly non-aggressive nature.

However, newly-released records show that that well-earned public image was very nearly ruined after promised and paid-for tickets for more than 300 fans did not arrive.

The situation was caused when British travel firm Sportex was wound up while fans were already in the US, meaning planned hotels and tickets for the three group games were suddenly unavailable.

On 13 December 1994, a letter from the Irish embassy in Washington DC to the Department of Foreign Affairs recalled the events in the already boiling hot June temperatures in Orlando, saying fans were irate before quick-thinking embassy officials took matters into their own hands.

It said: ""They [embassy officials] saved a potentially damaging and even riotous situation when the British travel firm, Sportex, collapsed and left many Irish soccer fans stranded and without tickets in Florida.

""In this case, they were a vital safety net for Ireland and our image here, especially given the intense and daily media interest in the Sportex case…

""I might add that, though it was a purely defensive and damage limitation effort on our part, the defusion of the potentially riotous situation involving Sportex fans in Florida prevented the important enhancement of the image of Ireland, which was developed during the world cup, being seriously undermined overnight.""

The description is supported by an earlier briefing note by the Department of Foreign Affairs' consular services in June 1994, which said in relation to the tickets fiasco: ""Since June 17 we have been trying to alleviate the consequences of the failure of this London company [Sportex] to pay for hotel accommodation and transport in the US, and to provide match tickets for 300 to 370 Cork people who had booked three match packages with them either direct or through Cork travel agents.

""By June 21 it was clear that no funds would be forthcoming from the company in time to be of practical relevance to the Irish clients affected.

""The company appears to have irregularly withdrawn about IR£100,000 from the fund and is under investigation by the British department of trade and industry.

""The situation on June 22 is that the consulate in Orlando has obtained tickets for most if not all the Sportex customers going to the Ireland-Mexico match and that the travel agents have paid for hotel accommodation to the end of this week for people who have booked through them.

""The position of the people who booked direct with Sportex remains to be clarified.""

And it was further highlighted in two more post-tournament messages, including a 15 July 1994 letter from Ireland's US ambassador Dermot Gallagher to Department of Foreign Affairs senior official Anne Anderson praising named embassy members for their ""outstanding"" performance ""in difficult and intimidating circumstances"", and a separate 2 August letter from then FAI chief executive Sean Connolly to Tánaiste Dick Spring.

Mr Connolly wrote: ""Everybody was particularly helpful and especially the people in Orlando who were faced with a considerable amount of work when it became evident a number of people were without tickets as a result of a travel company failure in England.""

While it is not in the archived records, RTÉ News understands that in some cases officials gave up their own tickets to ensure all fans who had been caught in the situation were able to get to the games.

Meanwhile, embassy officials were making last ditch-tackles of a different nature to defend Irish fans' reputation elsewhere too, after becoming aware of what they described as ""entirely fabricated"" US media reports of Irish and Italian supporters fighting in New York.

On 21 June 1994, Noel Kilkenny of the Irish embassy in Washington DC sent a fax to Brendan McMahon of the Department of Foreign Affairs referencing an article in the Washington Post by ""a self-confessed former soccer hooligan"" headlined ‘The Soccer Hooligans Are Coming, and I Should Know'.

The article told a sordid tale of ""violence between Irish and Italian fans"" in Manhattan's East Village and Hell's Kitchen after Ireland's historic 1-0 win at Giants' Stadium, claiming there was ""a pitched battle on Wednesday evening"".

Noting the fact the game actually took place on a Saturday not a Wednesday, Mr Kilkenny's fax went further: ""These comments are, at best, inaccurate or, at worst, a total fabrication. Neither the New York City Police nor the New York Port Authority police logged a single incident involving Irish fans over the past week.

""The ‘pitched battle' on Eighth Avenue did take place, but involved local street gangs - the police have confirmed that no soccer fans were involved.""

Mr Kilkenny said he had spoken with the deputy editor of the ‘Outlook' section of the Washington Post which published the story, and ""drew his attention to the blatant inaccuracies in the report"" and that ""a simple phone call to the police could have avoided such a blatantly inaccurate"" article.

The fax said that, in response, Mr Kilkenny - and presumably the Irish government - were told they could ask for a letter to be published in the newspaper. It is not stated how they responded.

Separate files also note the amount of public money that was being spent for government ministers and some officials to go to the USA '94 World Cup games.

One of these files from December 1995 was a Department of Finance briefing note to other officials, which said not properly registering costs and their exact reasons ""is a very serious matter"", and that given the ""one-off nature"" of World Cup trips, the comptroller and auditor general spending watchdog was likely to closely examine records.

In all, IR£150,000 in public money was spent on the event, including IR£88,000 on grants to support companies promoting Irish products, IR£2,354 for a helicopter for then-taoiseach Albert Reynolds, IR£3,000 for car hire, and other matters.

A large delegation of 11 government ministers went to various Ireland games at the World Cup, including then-tourism minister Charlie McCreevy, then ministers of state Pat 'The Cope' Gallagher, Liam Aylward and Tom Kitt, then-taoiseach Albert Reynolds, then-tánaiste Dick Spring, and then-finance minister Bertie Ahern - the latter of whom told officials when asked if he would attend ""I might go to one or two matches"".



That number was looked on dimly by the then opposition, including Fine Gael TD and Dáil public accounts committee chair Jim Mitchell, who questioned if all attending would actually be partaking in official duties as was claimed.

Other ministers travelling included enterprise minister Ruairi Quinn, who was attending an ""Industrial Development Authority"" meeting in New York in the days before the Italy game, and marine minister David Andrews, who also happened to be attending a meeting in New York, this time for the Irish Fisheries Board.

Some of those in the government delegation were seated in lucrative box and suite areas of the stadiums, with Ireland's ambassador to the US Dermot Gallagher telling the Department of Foreign Affairs on 9 June 1994 that two boxes for the Italy game which had a ""face value of $30,000 each"" had been ""made available to us at $1,500 each"".

Ireland's consul general Donal Hamill had written days earlier on 3 June that 100 tickets were available via the embassy for promotional clients and others who had been vetted, and would be for the Mexico and Norway games.

He said: ""Since public money was used to purchase these tickets, it is very important that exact records be kept of each ticket… it must be transparent both that public money was put to good use and that no individual or office benefited either materially or in kind from the distribution or sale of the tickets.

""You will note that each ticket has the words ‘embassy of Ireland' printed on it. I hardly need emphasise how important it would be that none of our allocation of tickets should reach the black market.""

The sheer number of ordinary Irish fans also travelling is also identified in the records, with an acceptance by April and May that the official 10,000-12,000 figure would easily double or more due to a surge in US visa requests.



While a briefing note signed by tourism minister Charlie McCreevy said Irish fans should act as ""ambassadors"" and help to bring US jobs to Ireland by carrying a special card with a map of Ireland, myths of Ireland, and connections with the US, American authorities initially took a dimmer view.

A file from 31 May, 1994, marked ""confidential"" and from the general secretariat of the European Council, said US immigration officials had asked Belgian, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Irish authorities - the EU countries which had qualified for the world cup - to provide information on any questionable characters who may be travelling.

The US request included information such as the ""names of persons convicted for serious soccer-related offences"", before trying to assure EU officials who raised data protection concerns that ""after the world cup the lists will be destroyed"".

That hurdle though clearly did not put off the tens of thousands of Irish fans who travelled for the World Cup, with a final file showing that interest was already clear months earlier.

In an unexpected 25 January 1994 letter from foreign affairs minister and tánaiste Dick Spring to the now disgraced former FIFA official Sepp Blatter, who at the time was the organisation's general secretary, Mr Spring wrote: ""Ireland's participation in World Cup ‘94 has generated a tremendous sense of pride and anticipation throughout the country. The groundswell of support for our team is quite extraordinary.

""As you know from previous tournaments, Irish fans traditionally travel in record numbers in support of their players.

""Against this background, we are very concerned that there should be an adequate supply of tickets for Irish supporters planning to travel. The indications so far have not been reassuring.

""I would hope that, when your decisions are being made in the coming days and weeks, FIFA will demonstrate as much understanding and flexibility as possible.""

Cristiano Ronaldo has expressed his determination to score 1,000 goals by the end of his career.

And the 40-year-old Portugal superstar is in no doubt he'll get there.

""I will reach that number for sure, if no injuries,"" Ronaldo said late Sunday at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, where he was named as the best player in the Middle East.

Ronaldo moved onto 956 career goals by scoring twice for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League on Saturday. His tally includes men's international record of 143 goals for Portugal, which Ronaldo is set to lead into next year's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

By the time the World Cup begins, Ronaldo — a five-time world player of the year — will be aged 41.

""I am still very motivated to carry on,"" the former Real Madrid, Manchester United and Juventus striker said on stage after receiving his award. ""It doesn't matter (where) I play — Middle East, in Europe — I always enjoy to play football, to win trophies, to score goals and I want to carry on.

""You know what my goal is: I want to win more trophies and I want to reach the number that you will all know.""

The World Cup is one of the few trophies missing from Ronaldo's collection. He won the European Championship with Portugal in 2016.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin will offer Thomas Tuchel 'something different' at the World Cup.

That is the view of talkSPORT's Darren Ambrose as he backed calls for the Leeds United striker to receive an England re-call.

Calvert-Lewin has not played for the Three Lions for over four years but is currently in record-breaking form for his club.

The 28-year-old scored in his sixth consecutive Premier League appearance on Sunday with his goal against Sunderland.

It is the first time the forward has done so as he took his tally for the season to eight.

Calvert-Lewin is currently the highest-scoring Englishman in the Premier League ahead of next summer's World Cup.

Discussing his current form, Ambrose told The Final Word: ""He's got seven in his last six, but he has eight this season.

""This purple [patch] he's on at the moment is probably the best of Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

""The Dominic Calvert-Lewin that got into that England side, the Dominic Calvert-Lewin that, in my opinion, should and could go to the World Cup.""

Calvert-Lewin has four goals in 11 caps for England but has not been called up since Euro 2020.

His last appearance for the Three Lions came in July 2021 against Ukraine in the quarter-finals of that tournament.

However, Tuchel's options up front appear lacking behind all-time leading scorer Harry Kane.

The England captain was the only recognised striker named in the most recent squad.

Asked if there is a chance Calvert-Lewin goes to the World Cup, Ambrose added: ""Yes, I certainly think there is.

""If you look at the forwards that they have. Yes, Harry Kane is number one, he is number one, when he's fit, he plays.

""You've got Ollie Watkins, you've got Dominic Solanke, where that guy is I don't know. You don't even get updates about Dominic Solanke anymore.""

Dominic Solanke has been limited to just two league appearance for Tottenham Hotspur this season due to injury.

Meanwhile, Ollie Watkins' brace against Chelsea on Saturday took his tally to five in 18 league outings for Aston Villa this term.

The depth in attack is a concern for Rory Jennings, who admitted: ""I feel like the drop off from Harry Kane to whoever we have to go for is stark.""

Ambrose believes this helps Calvert-Lewin's case as he argued: ""Dominic Calvert-Lewin offers you something different to Harry Kane.

""The goal he scored today, it was instinct. It was a forward on form, it was a forward full of confidence.""

England are next in action in March, with friendlies against Uruguay and Japan ahead of their World Cup campaign in the summer.

—

The Johnson County Parks and Recreation District wants artists from across the Kansas City region to help create flags for the 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer celebration. They're using an unexpected material – fabric from a decommissioned hot air balloon.

JCPRD is seeking 10 local artists who will each design four flags measuring three by six feet. The flags will be flown at Theater in the Park, where the county plans to host a free soccer celebration to watch the matches.

Flags have long served as symbols that bring people together and celebrate cultures worldwide, and Angi Hejduk from JCPRD says that was important to the project.

""The idea of public art as part of FIFA World Cup 2026 is that it was so easy to lean so directly into a soccer theme, versus using it as an opportunity to highlight the incredible artistry that exists in the Kansas City Metro Area,"" says Hejduk, JCPRD public arts specialist.

Hejduk said this also aims to bridge the gap between the art community and sports, giving artists and opportunity to contribute to events where they might not traditionally see their role.

Applications for interested artists are currently open and will remain available through January 11. The completed flags will be unveiled in May and will remain on display throughout the duration of the World Cup.

Gary Lineker believes that struggling Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres needs to take a leaf out of in-form Leeds United striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin's book. The Gunners hoped the Sweden international would be the final piece of the jigsaw in their bid to end their decades-long Premier League title drought. But as the former Sporting CP star underwhelms, ex-England international Lineker has pinpointed a way the forward can improve in front of goal.

Gyokeres scored a remarkable 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting before switching to Arsenal for around £64 million ($86m) over the summer. But he has found it much more difficult in the Premier League, where he has scored five goals in 15 games. Despite his struggles, manager Mikel Arteta is, naturally, backing the 27-year-old to come good.

He said earlier this month: ""Everybody was so excited to bring him into the club. We did it. We brought a player with an incredible scoring record who had to adapt to the league. He had no pre-season. The first few weeks were difficult because physically he wasn't in his best state and he's a player that needs that, like any other player in this league, almost to perform at that level. I know we need to continue to tweak and understand him a little bit better in certain situations, and he needs to do the same. But that's about time. We have full support for him.""

After a lukewarm start to life at Arsenal, ex-Tottenham forward Lineker believes Gyokeres needs to be more proactive in the penalty area to get away from defenders and convert chances. He also thinks that Leeds' Calvert-Lewin is a great example to follow, with the 28-year-old scoring in six straight games in the league. 

He said on the Rest is Football podcast: ""I've watched him [Gyokeres] quite closely the last few weeks and I think he's like most strikers, is one that waits to see where it's going, the ball, waits until it's crossed and then attacks the space. That's what defenders do, as a striker you got to gamble on where you think the ball might go and you go just as they're about to cross it. You steal a march on the defender that way and lots of the time the ball won't go there, but I don't see him doing that very often. Dominic Calvert Lewin did a perfect example of how to do that for the Leeds goal at Sunderland, perfect. He didn't wait and to see where it was going to go. He went right, I pulled away and then he sprinted at the near post and hoped that the ball would be delivered there and it was. I don't see that too often from Gyokeres at present, the players that score big numbers will do that. You know, [Erling] Haaland, [Harry] Kane, [Robert] Lewandowski, they know how to make those kind of moves into those spaces. Is it something you can learn? I've always thought yes, but because it's actually common sense because it's law of probability when you think about it.""

Leeds looked like relegation fodder just a month or so ago. But wins over Chelsea and Crystal Palace, coupled with creditable draws with Liverpool, Brentford, and Sunderland, have sent them seven points clear of the bottom three. And Calvert-Lewin has been central to that upturn in form, with the ex-Everton man scoring all of his eight goals this term in the box. 

When asked about bagging his seventh goal in six matches, he told BBC Match of the Day, ""I think we've shown we can mix our game up. We can be direct, we can play football. It's good versatility within the team. A good goal scored. It's always a good feeling to be scoring regularly. I'm in a good moment at the minute. My timing is good. As a team we're gelling a bit more. Things are going well for us. You're in flow. You can make those runs as a centre-forward and sometimes the ball doesn't find you when you're in a dry spell. But you've just got to keep doing it and hope that the tide will turn and that's what has happened for me at the moment. I'm feeling good, feeling strong and I'm enjoying playing with the lads.""

Gyokeres was not at his best in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Brighton at the weekend, so there is a chance he won't start in their crunch clash with high-flying Aston Villa at Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liverpool urged to make audacious swoop for impressive Arsenal star to solve 'major issue' for Arne Slot's Reds","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/liverpool-urged-make-shock-swoop-arsenal-star-solve-major-issue-arne-slot/bltd1f173761258e869","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:12:25 GMT","

Liverpool have been told to plough ahead with a bold move for Arsenal star Jurrien Timber as Arne Slot seeks to address his side's issues in defence. The Reds won the Premier League title last season but this term they are finding their defence much more difficult. The Merseyside outfit have shipped 26 goals in just 18 league games and now they're being urged to strengthen their backline.

While Liverpool have won their last three league games and are up to fourth in the Premier League after going on their worst run of form for decades, they still can be got at defensively. Indeed, captain Virgil van Dijk expressed his concern about his side's frailties when it comes to set-pieces, with the Reds letting in 12 goals from that facet of the game this season. 

He said after Liverpool's 2-1 win over Wolves at the weekend: ""There have been plenty of games when we have defended them very well. But the fact is we've conceded too many set-piece goals and we don't score enough. It's something we have to improve. I would say at least 75% of the time or even more, it's not even about the first contact. It's the second phase that is the killer. Is it a mental thing? I hope not. If that's in your head then it's an issue. Personally, it's not in my head. We have defended so many set-pieces very well. But we've conceded too many goals like that and it hurts. We have to improve that. Training is the only way to get better at it. It's not been good enough. We all realise that. We have spoken about it. We need to turn it around. That's why we work on it almost every training session.""

Head coach Slot is well aware that Liverpool are shipping goals from set-pieces but they are also not scoring from corners, free-kicks, or throw-ins. Despite that, they are still finding a way to win of late.

The Dutchman added: ""Unfortunately, we're maybe the only team that hardly ever scores from a set-piece and, even worse, we constantly concede. But then, I think I said two, three or four weeks ago, we have to make sure that when things go against us – it could be a set-piece, it could be other things – we still need to find a way to win. In the last two games, we conceded from a set-piece but we were able to win and that hasn't happened many times this season. That's progress for me, but it's obvious there are more things for us to improve and this is definitely one of them. I think we have been unlucky in multiple situations in our set-pieces. It is 18 games now, and we need to improve.""

Timber has been one of Arsenal's best players this season, and even though he has two-and-a-half-years left on his contract, the Premier League leaders are reportedly trying to extend his stay at Emirates Stadium. Despite that, former Reds defender Stephen Warnock thinks the versatile defender would be the perfect option to fill the void left by Trent Alexander-Arnold following his summer move to Real Madrid. It seems he does not think too much of Liverpool's right-back options of Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley. 

He told Aceodds: ""When I look at the defence and who Liverpool should sign, personally I think they need a centre back and a right back In the right back position they have Frimpong, Gomez and Bradley. All three are injury-prone and they are not robust enough to play week in week out, and that is something they have to go away from. Liverpool has to look at how reliable their players are to play every single week, and at the moment those players aren't fit enough for that. That is a major issue for Liverpool at the moment. Liverpool are a better team when they have a proper right back in that position. It balances the team better and allows Szoboszlai to play in the midfield. So, I think signing a right back is equally as important as signing a centre back at the moment. The issue I have with right backs at the moment is that it always seems to be midfield players playing there, the Guardiola style. I think you need a specialist for that right back, which can be difficult to find in January. In an ideal world I would bring in Jurrien Timber, but I don't think Arsenal would allow that. I think he is the best right back in the league. I think he is brilliant. Someone of that quality who is good in 1v1 situations. Since his ACL injury he has shown his robustness to come back.""

Kylian Mbappe's ownership era at Caen has taken a bold new turn after the French club appointed former Arsenal and Manchester City defender Gael Clichy as head coach. The 40-year-old steps into his first senior managerial role amid supporter unrest, with the club banking on his elite pedigree to spark a revival as they struggle in the third tier of French football.

SM Caen have confirmed the appointment of Clichy as head coach, handing the former Arsenal and Manchester City defender his first senior managerial job. The move comes after a turbulent period at the club, both on and off the pitch, following relegation and a damaging run of results.

Clichy replaces Maxime d'Ornano, who was dismissed after Caen failed to meet expectations in the league and suffered a disappointing Coupe de France exit. The club have struggled for consistency and direction since dropping out of Ligue 2, leaving them marooned in a mid-table fight in Championnat National, and in need of a clear reset heading into the second half of the campaign.

The appointment also lands against the backdrop of growing tension between supporters and ownership. Caen are majority-owned by Real Madrid star Mbappe, and recent weeks have seen protests from fans unhappy with the club's sporting decisions, including the sacking of former club legend Nicolas Seube. Clichy now steps into a role carrying both opportunity and pressure.

In confirming the appointment, Caen released a detailed statement outlining why they believe Clichy is the right man to lead the club forward. The club said: “Stade Malherbe Caen announces the arrival of Gael Clichy as head coach of its professional team.”

The statement continued by underlining the qualities they expect the former France international to bring: “A former French international, he will bring to the club his experience at the highest level, his knowledge of modern football, and his high standards.”

Caen also highlighted Clichy's pathway into coaching and the support structure around him, adding: “After his time at Arsenal and Manchester City as a player, Gael quickly transitioned into a hybrid player/coach role at Basaksehir Istanbul and Servette Geneva. He then joined Thierry Henry as manager of the French Under-21 team, an experience that culminated in a second-place finish at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He will be accompanied by Marvin Esor, who will complete the current technical staff which remains unchanged. SM Caen welcomes this new coach and offers him its full support to meet the challenges of the second half of the season.”

Clichy's appointment represents a significant step in his post-playing career. After retiring in 2023, the former left-back moved quickly into coaching, initially taking on hybrid player-coach roles before joining Thierry Henry's staff with the France Under-21 side. That spell proved formative, culminating in an Olympic silver medal on home soil in Paris in 2024.

Clichy brings immense pedigree to Caen as he was part of Arsenal's legendary “Invincibles” side and later enjoyed sustained success at Manchester City, winning multiple Premier League titles. Caen believe that exposure to elite environments under managers such as Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola has equipped him with the tactical grounding and standards required to lead a rebuilding project.

The context at Caen is far removed from the comforts of top-tier football. The club are operating in France's third tier and dealing with fractured relations between fans and ownership. Supporters have recently unveiled banners aimed at Mbappe, reading: “Mbappe, SMC is not your toy,” underlining the volatile atmosphere Clichy must now navigate alongside the sporting challenge.

Clichy's immediate task will be to stabilise performances and restore belief within the squad. Caen's ambitions remain promotion-focused, but the reality of their league position means the new coach will need to prioritise consistency and structure before any serious push up the table can be mounted.

Off the pitch, Clichy will also be expected to act as a bridge between supporters and the club's hierarchy. With Mbappe's ownership under intense scrutiny, clear communication and visible progress will be crucial if tensions are to be eased and patience rebuilt among the fanbase.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

John Terry is set to part with some of the most emotionally charged items of his storied Chelsea career, including the infamous “tear-stained” shirt from the 2008 Champions League final defeat to Manchester United. The former Blues captain will auction the memorabilia at a charity sale, with proceeds supporting causes close to his heart through his foundation.

Terry has confirmed plans to auction a remarkable collection of personal football memorabilia, headlined by two iconic shirts from his Champions League final appearances with Chelsea. Among the items is the shirt he wore during the 2008 Champions League final loss to Manchester United in Moscow, a match remembered for Terry's missed penalty in the shootout after slipping on the spot.

The former England defender is also selling the full Chelsea kit he wore during the club's 2012 Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich. Despite being suspended for the final, Terry famously changed into his full playing kit to lift the trophy alongside his teammates, creating one of the most debated images in modern football history.

The sale forms part of a 26-lot charity auction being hosted by Goldin Auctions in New Jersey. Proceeds from the event will go to the John Terry Foundation, which supports a range of British charities, with the auction scheduled to conclude on December 31.

Explaining the motivation behind the sale, Terry stressed that the decision was driven by charity rather than sentimentality. “My foundation is going to benefit with two close-to-my-heart charities which desperately need the money, so it is going to a great cause,” he said.

The former Chelsea skipper acknowledged the emotional weight attached to several of the items, particularly those linked to defining moments of both heartbreak and triumph in his career. The 2008 shirt, which he has described as “tear-stained,” remains one of the most painful reminders of his playing days, while the 2012 kit represents ultimate redemption on Europe's biggest stage.

Terry has also spoken previously about wanting his memorabilia to serve a purpose beyond personal nostalgia. By releasing them into public ownership, he hopes they will raise significant funds while allowing fans and collectors to own tangible pieces of football history tied to Chelsea's golden era.

The most valuable item in the auction is not a shirt, but Terry's Premier League winner's medal from the 2004-05 season. That campaign saw Chelsea secure their first league title in 50 years, with Terry lifting the trophy as captain. The medal alone is expected to fetch up to £75,000, underlining its historical significance.

Other notable lots include match-worn shirts swapped with some of the game's greatest players. Jerseys belonging to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are both included, alongside a shirt from Thierry Henry dating back to Arsenal's 2003-04 “Invincibles” season. Each item reflects Terry's longevity and the calibre of opponents he faced throughout his career.

The Champions League memorabilia carries particular resonance. The Moscow final shirt from 2008, estimated at £3,750, captures one of the most dramatic nights in European football, while the miniature Champions League trophy from 2012 and the full-kit celebration shirt highlight the emotional extremes Terry experienced at the highest level.

With the auction set to close on December 31, attention will turn to how much the collection raises for the John Terry Foundation. Given the historic value of the items and Terry's status as one of Chelsea's greatest-ever players, the sale is expected to generate significant interest from collectors worldwide.

Beyond the auction, Terry continues to focus on his charitable work, using his profile and legacy to support causes across England and Wales. The decision to part with such personal items suggests a conscious effort to turn career-defining moments into lasting positive impact off the pitch.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Amad Diallo hailed Manchester United team-mate Bryan Mbeumo as a ""good lad"" after the pair swapped shirts following their Africa Cup of Nations clash between Ivory Coast and Cameroon. The former scored a brilliant goal as the two African heavyweights played out a 1-1 draw on Sunday as both nations inched closer to the knockout stages of the competition.

After scoring in Ivory Coast's 1-0 win over Mozambique last week in their AFCON opener, the 23-year-old was at it again with a terrific curled effort on Sunday. It was not enough to secure another three points as a Ghislain Konan own goal ensured both countries shared the spoils. After the match, the pair swapped jerseys, before Amad revealed that the two spoke before the big match.

He told reporters, ""Bryan is a good teammate; good lad. We talked before the game. I told him after the game, we can change jerseys. He is a good lad and I wish him all the best with Cameroon. I want to think about myself, about my team, and try to win the last game. 

""It's a good goal, but I don't think it's one of the best. I was happy - I wanted to win the game especially, but the goal [does have some significance] for me.""

Both Cameroon and Ivory Coast are on four points in their group heading into their final fixture. If they don't lose, they will progress to the next round.

Amad was also asked about what it was like to be involved in a game between West African rivals and matches between Manchester City and United. While both are huge events in their own right, the wing-back said they are different beasts. 

He said, ""It's different. We are talking about Africa, so it's different. Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon are big nations. This game was a big game. Cameroon have quality in the team. Bryan and Carlos Baleba play in the Premier League, so we knew in the beginning that it was going to be very tough to win this game. We were unlucky to draw the game, so now, we're going to focus on the next game against Gabon and try to win that game.""

Not long after Mbeumo swapped Brentford for United over the summer in a £71 million ($95.5m) transfer, Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim lauded the impact of the winger at Old Trafford. Among other things, the Portuguese was mightily impressed by his quality and work rate.

He told reporters, ""He's a working machine. He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad, it's really hard to beat these two guys because they change position, they are really fast, they are good in one against one. My role was, as a manager, to explain what I want from him. But it was more the club. And you guys. We can struggle a lot, but it's Manchester United. When Manchester United is there, and when we feel that this player wants to come here, no matter what, no matter what the position, no matter if it's Champions League or not, we also give everything to bring these kind of guys, and that was the case.""

In addition to not being able to call on Amad and Mbeumo, United are also without defender Noussair Mazraoui, who is representing Morocco. The Red Devils beat Newcastle United last week and are up to sixth in the league, but Amorim made it clear that his side will miss these players over the winter period.

""We will have time to suffer. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity,"" he said. ""When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us. They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Rasmus Hojlund's revival in Italy has gathered pace after another decisive display for Napoli, prompting Antonio Conte to explain why the striker is now thriving following his Manchester United exit. The Napoli boss praised the Dane's growing understanding of the role, while stressing that his side are still chasing the elite standard set by Serie A's top contenders.

Hojlund was the standout performer as Napoli claimed a 2-0 Serie A victory away at Cremonese, with the forward scoring both goals in a confident and controlled display. The result came just days after Napoli lifted the Supercoppa Italiana in Riyadh, ensuring momentum was maintained domestically after a setback against Udinese had briefly knocked them off the summit.

Hojlund's brace underlined how quickly he has settled in Italy since leaving Manchester United on a season-long loan. The 22-year-old looked sharp throughout, leading the line with authority, stretching the Cremonese defence and coming close to completing a hat-trick as Napoli dictated proceedings for long spells.

Despite the convincing scoreline, the match was shaped by Napoli's need to adapt. Injuries and absences forced tactical reshuffles, yet the system continued to create chances for Hojlund, whose movement and physical presence proved decisive. His growing influence has become a central talking point as Napoli look to consolidate their position near the top of the table.

Napoli head coach Conte was quick to highlight the striker's development, while also offering a broader assessment of his team's level. “Hojlund is a player who is very young, he's still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Conte explained after the win.

“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he's starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off,” he added, pointing to the tactical growth that has fuelled Hojlund's resurgence in front of goal.

Conte also underlined how important the striker is within his overall philosophy. “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.” However, the coach struck a note of realism, stressing that Napoli are “not at the same level” as Juventus, Inter or AC Milan despite recent success.

Hojlund's upturn in form is striking when viewed against his final months in England. At Manchester United, the Dane often appeared isolated, battling to adapt in a side lacking consistency and creative flow. In Naples, the structure around him has been clearer, allowing his strengths to come to the fore.

This season, he has already scored more goals for Napoli than he managed across the entirety of his previous campaign with the Red Devils in the Premier League. The contrast has fuelled discussion about whether the environment and tactical clarity in Serie A are better suited to his profile, especially under a coach renowned for developing physically dominant forwards.

There is also a contractual subplot as Hojlund's loan includes an obligation for Napoli to sign him permanently if Champions League qualification is secured, adding extra significance to every goal he scores. With Napoli firmly in the hunt, his performances are not just rehabilitating his reputation but actively shaping the club's medium-term planning.

Napoli face a demanding run of fixtures that will test both their depth and their credentials as they will take on Lazio, Inter Milan and Juventus in Serie A, and Chelsea in the Champions League. Conte has already warned that injuries and squad limitations remain an obstacle, making consistency crucial as the season progresses into the new year.

For Hojlund, the challenge is to maintain this level. Conte has been careful to emphasise patience and development over hype, but continued goals will inevitably strengthen calls for Napoli to accelerate plans for a permanent transfer. Each appearance further distances the striker from the struggles of his Manchester United spell.

Longer term, Hojlund's resurgence raises questions about his trajectory at club and international level. At just 22, he appears to have rediscovered confidence and clarity in his game.

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

Lando Norris received words of support from some well-known names during his bid for the World Championship, something he feels had a positive impact on his chances.

Lando Norris has spoken of the positive impact that receiving messages from several fellow athletes – including F1 World Champions Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel – had on him through his 2025 title bid.

After heading the Drivers' Championship standings during the opening stages of the season – following his victory at the first race of the campaign in Australia – Norris lost the lead to McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri following Round 5 in Saudi Arabia.

There were some difficult moments to come for Norris, including a collision with Piastri in Canada that put him out of the race, while a retirement at Zandvoort caused by a mechanical issue set him back in his championship prospects.

However, the Briton embarked on a strong run of form during the second half of the season that saw him retake the lead with a dominant victory at Round 20 in Mexico, before going on to beat Piastri and Max Verstappen to the World Championship at the finale in Abu Dhabi.

Looking back on his title-winning campaign during his first in-depth interview since taking the crown, Norris told F1.com's Lawrence Barretto about the support and advice he received throughout the season from those who had previously been there before, both in F1 and from other sports.

""I've had some great words and great text messages and conversations with some incredible people, people that have won World Championships in different sports, Lewis and others like Seb,” said Norris. “A lot of people don't know I speak to Seb about things.

""A lot of these people, [former MotoGP champion Casey] Stoner, who, when I needed it most, sent me that little text message and said, 'think of this, believe in yourself, do this, do that', and just help me along.”

Norris believes that those words – along with the wider support from those around him – played a role in him clinching his maiden World Championship by two points from closest rival Verstappen.

""When you win the championship by two points, I would certainly say having these moments of faith from others around me got me those two points,” the 26-year-old conceded.

“And therefore, that's why I've got to thank everyone around me because two points is also what you need.""

	“Nothing beats being in a band,” says Gary Barlow in a new clip from Netflix‘s Take That docuseries.


	The streaming giant has released a first-look clip — showing the band backstage ahead of a gig in the '90s — and images from its three-part limited series, set to drop Jan. 27.




	In Take That, viewers are taken behind the scenes with members Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen, Jason Orange, and Robbie Williams as they reveal their personal experiences in a band that captivated millions of fans, playing sold-out shows, topping the charts with 12 huge U.K. No. 1 hit singles and selling over 45 million records worldwide.

	Featuring 35 years of rare archive, never-before-seen footage and personal material, as well as brand new interviews with Barlow, Donald and Owen, the series promises to offer an “intimate look at the highs, the heartbreaks, and the enduring legacy of one of the U.K.'s most successful bands of all time.”


	“From their early beginnings as [a] five piece formed in Manchester to becoming pop superstars, relive the camaraderie, chaos, and resilience that fueled their meteoric rise, dramatic split, and one of the greatest comebacks in British music history,” says a plot synopsis. “Told in their own words, this is the deeply personal and definitive story of Take That.”

	











	Produced by Fullwell Entertainment, Take That is directed by David Soutar (Bros: After the Screaming Stops, Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All) and is executive produced by Gabe Turner.

Duane “Keffe D” Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a “misleading portrait” of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer. 


							By 

	The Associated Press



	The attorneys for the man accused of killing rap icon Tupac Shakur in 1996 are pushing to suppress evidence obtained in what they claim was an “unlawful nighttime search.”


	Las Vegas criminal defense attorneys Robert Draskovich and William Brown filed a motion this week on behalf of their client, Duane “Keffe D” Davis, who was charged in the drive-by shooting of the iconic rapper off the Las Vegas Strip.




	Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a “misleading portrait” of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer to grant the execution of a search warrant at night, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as if there's a risk that evidence will disappear if officers wait until morning.

	In reality, Davis, an ex- gang leader from Southern California, had left the narcotics trade in 2008 and began doing inspection work for oil refineries, his attorneys say. He was a 60-year-old retired cancer survivor with adult children and grandchildren and had been living with his wife in Henderson, a city outside of Las Vegas, for nine years at the time the warrant was executed.




			Related Video		







	“The court wasn't told any of this,” his attorneys wrote in the motion. “As a result, the court authorized a nighttime search based on a portrait of Davis that bore little resemblance to reality — a clearly erroneous factual determination, in other words.”

	











	The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department — which conducted the search and collected Davis' electronic devices, “purported marijuana” and tubs of photographs — declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation. At the time of the search, police said executing the warrant under the cover of darkness would allow officers to surround and secure the residence, and that if Davis barricaded himself, the darkness would allow officers to evacuate the surrounding homes with the least exposure to residents.


	Davis was arrested in September 2023. He pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and sought to be released since shortly after his arrest.


	His attorneys claim Davis' arrest stems from false public statements Davis had made in which he claimed to be present in the white Cadillac from which Shakur was shot. They say he has never offered details that would firmly corroborate his presence in the car, and that he benefited from saying he was present. He dodged drug charges by telling the story in a proffer agreement, and he has made money by repeating it in documentaries and his 2019 book, according to his attorneys.


	He sought to dismiss his murder charges in the Nevada Supreme Court, but in November his petition was denied.


	“Think of it this way: Shakur's murder was essentially the entertainment world's JFK assassination — endlessly dissected, mythologized, monetized — so it's not hard to see why someone in Davis's position might falsely place himself at the center of it all for personal gain,” his attorneys wrote.

	Jessica Lynch



Britney Spears shared a pointed message on social media over the weekend, criticizing her family after they appeared to celebrate Christmas together without her.


	On Sunday (Dec. 28), Spears posted a message to Instagram alongside a photo of a decorated Christmas tree, using sarcasm to address what she described as long-standing hurt tied to her family relationships.

	“Merry late Christmas to my beautiful family who have never disrespected me, harmed me, ever done anything completely unacceptable or caused unbelievable trauma, the kind you can't fix,” Spears wrote. “To my dear sweet innocent family… so so sorry I was busy this Christmas but I will definitely show up and surprise you soon.”


	The post appeared to be in response to a festive photo shared earlier in the week by her younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, which showed Jamie Lynn celebrating the holiday with her husband Jamie Watson, daughters Maddie, 17, and Ivey, 7, as well as their mother Lynne Spears and Britney's son Sean Preston Federline.


	In a separate line within the same post, Spears directly referenced her niece Ivey, writing, “Hello, beautiful Ivey… I just want to hold you, my love… Godspeed, friends.”


	According to People, Spears spent Christmas Day with her younger son, Jayden James Federline, 19. “Britney had a fun time celebrating Christmas with Jayden,” a source told the outlet. “It's been such a special holiday.”

	











	Spears shares Jayden and Sean with her ex-husband, Kevin Federline.


	The singer has remained estranged from several members of her family since the end of her 13-year conservatorship in November 2021, a legal arrangement that governed both her personal and professional life. 


	Since its termination, Spears has repeatedly spoken — often through social media — about the emotional toll of that period and her fractured relationships with relatives involved in the arrangement.


	While Spears' relationship with her family has remained strained, she has recently suggested that her bond with her sons is improving. 


	In recent months, she has posted more positively about her children, including acknowledging time spent together and expressing optimism about their connection moving forward.

	The song is also nominated for best gospel performance/song at the Grammy Awards, scheduled for Feb. 1.

	“From the beginning, there was something within us that wanted to prove something,” says Mark Owen in the first trailer for Netflix‘s doc series about British boy band Take That.


	He and bandmate Gary Barlow are seen backstage at a 1990s gig as their voices from the present talk over the footage. Watch the 45-second trailer above.


	Launching on January 27, 2026, Take That will document the band's long journey and personal relationships with each other over three episodes, using never-seen-before footage, interviews and rare archive captured over 35 years. “Nothing beats being in a band,” says Barlow as the trailer begins.

	Take That were at the forefront of the UK's boy band revolution in the 1990s, playing dozens of sold-out shows. In total, they have had 12 number one singles and sold over 45 million records worldwide, and remain active today, with Gary, Mark, Howard and Jason set to embark on a 17-date tour,  Circus Live.


	All five members of the band took part in the doc, which Fullwell Entertainment is producing Take That. David Soutar (Bros: After the Screaming Stops) is the director and Gabe Turner is the exec producer.


	Per the synopsis: “From their early beginnings as five piece formed in Manchester to becoming pop superstars, relive the camaraderie, chaos, and resilience that fueled their meteoric rise, dramatic split, and one of the greatest comebacks in British music history. Told in their own words, this is the deeply personal and definitive story of Take That.”

EXCLUSIVE: The BBC's most famous fringe is coming to a sofa near you.


	Deadline can reveal that The Claudia Winkleman Show has been officially commissioned and will launch next spring. The news comes three days before the fourth season of the Winkleman-hosted The Traitors launches.


	Winkleman, who is enjoying quite the purple patch after a 30-year career, will front the seven-episode primetime BBC talk show that will “welcome the biggest names from the worlds of film, television, music and beyond to her sofa for lively conversation with the help of a studio audience,” the BBC said. Broadcast information and guests will be revealed “in due course.”

The Claudia Winkleman Show will debut on BBC One and BBC iPlayer in spring 2026. We revealed that the long-gestating chat show was being produced by The Graham Norton Show maker So Television and Little Arrow in October. Those plans, we understand, will see Winkleman's series broadcast when The Graham Norton Show is off-air in the spring, meaning there will be no clashes between the shows and they will not be competing for guests. The BBC recently renewed The Graham Norton Show for another three years, while its recent run of episodes has boasted eye-catching bookings including Taylor Swift. Winkleman  earned her chat show stripes by stepping in for Norton earlier this year when the Irish presenter was on a break from his BBC duties. ITV Studios-backed So Television has made more than 550 episodes of his Friday night talk show since 2007.

	“Claudia is a true national treasure – warm, witty and endlessly entertaining,” said BBC commissioning editor Kalpna Patel-Knight. “She has an extraordinary ability to put people at ease and bring out the very best in them, whether they're global superstars or members of the audience.”


	Winkleman's star has soared since hosting the first season of The Traitors in 2022 and its celebrity spin-off several weeks back. She also fronts Channel 4's The Piano, while she presented BBC Radio 2's Saturday morning breakfast show until last year. She will have more time on her hands, however, now that she has presented her final episode of Strictly Come Dancing, the BBC Saturday night juggernaut that she has fronted with Tess Daly since 2010. 


	The latest civilian season of The Traitors is set to launch on New Year's Day (January 1, 2026). Winkleman has been in the press overnight teasing “truly extraordinary” twists and “hardcore” round tables for the murder mystery reality series, with a red-cloaked figure keeping fans guessing.


	Winkleman said: “I can't quite believe it and I'm incredibly grateful to the BBC for this amazing opportunity. I'm obviously going to be awful, that goes without saying, but I'm over the moon they're letting me try.”


	So Television Managing Director Graham Stuart added: “Graham Norton has made the Friday night talk show slot a dazzling appointment to view. How can you possibly follow that? By booking a host equally as brilliant. So we have.”


	So Television's co-production partner on Winkleman's chat show, Little Arrow, is the management and production company launched by Winkleman's agent, Holly Bott, in July 2024. The company has the backing of Operation Mincemeat maker Archery Pictures, the drama production house that Winkleman's husband, Kris Thykier, leads as CEO.


	Executive producers on The Claudia Winkleman Show are Stuart and Ruth Phillips. Patel-Knight, Head of Entertainment Commissioning at the BBC, commissioned and the commissioning editor is Neil McCallum. ITV Studios is selling The Claudia Winkleman Show around the world.

	With Jay Kelly, George Clooney experienced a bit of art imitating life, thanks to the Netflix film's co-writer/director Noah Baumbach.


	Discussing a scene in which his titular movie star receives a lifetime achievement award in a packed theater after watching a reel of his onscreen career, the 2x Oscar-winning actor said he “was surprised” by Baumbach using clips from Clooney's own filmography.


	“Oh, it was a surprise all right. I was surprised,” said Clooney on Entertainment Weekly‘s Around the Table, as co-star Adam Sandler added, “We were both surprised. We felt things that we didn't expect to feel.”

	Clooney added, “We held hands. No, I didn't know he was going to use sort of clips from my own actual career, which was a surprise. And you get to look at a lot of bad haircuts over the… mullets.


	“Don't you laugh,” he quipped to Sandler. “You had a mullet.”


	Now available to stream on Netflix, the film follows famous actor Jay Kelly (Clooney) as he embarks on a journey of self-discovery. He confronts both his past and present, accompanied by his loyal manager Ron (Sandler). The film blends poignant themes with humor, capturing the regrets amid the notable achievements of life.

Blake Lively gave a glimpse into her festive holiday celebrations with her family,

The actress posted an Instagram Story on Sunday of “her heaven,” which included her husband, Ryan Reynolds, 49, and their four children: James, 11, Inez, 9, Betty, 6, and Olin, 2.

The “Gossip Girl” alum, 38, shared a cozy and colorful pic of her continuing to savor the holidays.

Lively's activities included enjoying ice cold milk and cookies, a game of Mahjong and watching Chip and Joanna Gaines' hit HGTV show “Fixer Upper.”

“Nothing better…family, hot cookies, iced cold milk (yes, with ice, iykyk),” Lively wrote. “A fire, Mahjong, a sparkly Britney Spears inspired water bottle, snow outside and a new season of Fixer Upper.”

“My heaven,” she added.

Lively has been busy promoting her hair care line, Blake Brown Beauty, as she also continues to battle her “It Ends With Us” co-star and director, Justin Baldoni, in court.

Earlier this month, her lawyers blasted Baldoni's attorneys over their “probative” questions regarding the actress' sex life and alleged “disruptive” behavior during her depositions.

“Ms. Lively's sexual and/or romantic history has no bearing on the matters at issue in this case and we will not tolerate such examination, which will be the subject of a protective order and sanctions motion if it happens again,” Lively's attorneys wrote in a letter included in a Dec. 19 filing obtained by Page Six.

In addition, Lively's legal team also complained that Baldoni's lawyers showed a “lack of basic decorum” due to their “insulting comments, audible cross-talk and laughter during examination.”

On Dec. 9, Judge Lewis J. Liman postponed Lively and Baldoni's trial — which was initially scheduled to begin on March 9, 2026 — to May 18 because of his hectic schedule, People reported.

The two parties have a court-mandatory settlement conference scheduled for Feb. 11, per the outlet.

Lively filed a formal lawsuit against Baldoni in December 2024 for alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and lost wages.

Baldoni, 41, denied the allegations and responded with a $400 million countersuit against Lively and Reynolds. However, that suit has since been tossed.

Kanye West had an “awkward” moment with “dear friend” Deon Cole onstage at his comedy show Friday night.

While the “Grown-ish” actor was wrapping his set at the Hollywood Improv, he asked the rapper — who attended the show with his wife, Bianca Censori, and music exec John Monopoly — to come onstage.

“Go on and give it up for a dear friend. Thank you for coming out, dog. You had a good time tonight?” Cole asked West, who simply nodded.

“Did you laugh? Like, not no fake laugh. … You wouldn't give me no sympathy laugh?” the comedian asked the dad of four, who only laughed and shook his head.

“You was, like, busting the f–k up? Why your body language ain't showing bust the f–k up body language? You up there like, ‘Hmm. Yeah,'” Cole quipped.

The “Black-ish” alum, 53, then told West, 48, that he appreciated him coming out to the show.

When the Grammy winner continued to stand there silently, Cole joked they were having a “good, healthy conversation.”

The “Average Joe” star then asked West if he had any forthcoming projects audience members should be “looking out for,” to which the Yeezy founder replied, “New album coming out.”

Cole then joked that he would like to be featured on an interlude on West's new album, also asking whether he could be sent a care package of clothing.

Cole shared a video of the moment via Instagram, with fans labeling the back and forth “AWKWARD AF.”

“lol man.. awkward meets awkward! It's sumn in the Chicago pop! Lol,” one social media user wrote,” with another quipping, “Kanye acting like the slow cousin.”

A third netizen commented, “You definitely put him on the spot. He probably has social anxiety or sumn.”

“That was awkward as hell,” wrote a fourth fan.

Two days prior, West and Censori, 30, enjoyed a Christmas Eve date night to see a performance of “The Nutcracker” ballet in Los Angeles.

TMZ reported that the duo, who tied the knot in 2022, kept a low profile throughout the show.

On Sunday, the pair brought West's son Saint, 10, and daughter Chicago, 7, to Disneyland's California Adventure.

“Inside the purse, a small container with ‘Happy Pills' imprinted on the top was located, which contained 12 circular white pills with a ‘P' imprint on one side, and half of an oblong blue pill with no identifiable imprints,” the police report states.

“When asked about the pills found inside the purse, the offender stated that the blue pill was Xanax and the white pills were birth control. The offender stated she had a prescription for the Xanax but did not have any proof of that information available at the time.”

According to the police report, Lilly didn't know the brand of the alleged birth control pills.

All of the pills were seized and sent for testing, with the crime incident being identified on the police report as a “drugs/narcotics violation.”

In her mug shot, Lilly wore a blue-and-white checkered uniform and pouted her lips as she flashed the camera a smoldering stare. She wore her long, brown hair down and parted down the middle.

On Sunday, around 8:45 p.m. local time, the model posted a selfie on her Instagram Story, telling her followers that she was getting ready to see the movie “Marty Supreme.”

Her reps, as well as reps for Bravo, did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

The US Sun was first to report on the arrest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Autumn Reeser Says New Hallmark Movie Brought Out Another Side of Herself (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/autumn-reeser-we-met-in-december-character/","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 02:56:54 GMT","

Beloved Hallmark Channel actress Autumn Reeser knew as soon as she read the script for her 2025 Christmas movie, “We Met in December,” that playing Annie Lane would stretch her in new ways. 

“The very first thing that I saw when I read this script is the long nails on this character,” Reeser told EntertainmentNow, noting that Annie's well-manicured nails signaled to her that the Chicago professional she was playing was very in touch with her “femininity” — a trait Reeser was excited to explore. 

Written by longtime Hallmark screenwriter Nina Weinman, “We Met in December” is about two Chicagoans — played by Reeser and Hallmark fan favorite Niall Matter — who happen to meet while snowbound at a beautiful hotel before the holidays. After a magical night getting to know each other, they wind up searching for each other back home, having failed to exchange their contact information or even their last names. 

Reeser told EntertainmentNow that what she enjoyed most was “getting to play with my own sense of femininity,” starting with her character's well-manicured nails. 

“I don't wear my nails long, but it was very clear that she does,” Reeser said. “So the character reallyblossomed from there — the way she moves, what she wears, what she doesn't wear. And I really had a pretty deep experience with reconnecting with that level of femininity within me.”

After the three-week shoot, Reeser admitted, “I took the nails off immediately! But there was a lot of fun that I found in that, and a lot of ways that people approached me differently simply because of how I was expressing myself.” “You know, I am wearing a hot pink sweater,” Reeser laughed, “so maybe a bit of Annie stuck with me!” 

“I think what Niall and I bring to this story is a lot of truth and a lot of maturity,” Reeser told EntertainmentNow of diving into their “We Met in December” characters. “These are mature adults.”

“I think sometimes in these movies, like my last movie that I did, ‘Junebug,' the characters are stunted in their growth. That's fun in a lot of ways, too. But (for ‘We Met in December'), Nina really wrote full-grown adults and Niall and I got to play that. That was fun in its own way.” 

It helped that she and Matter already had great chemistry. Shortly after meeting at the Hallmark Christmas Experience in 2024, the two wound up in deep conversation, she said.

Reeser, who's been open about her own spiritual journey over the last decade, explained, “I love Niall. He's really gone on a deep, transformational journey, as well. And those are the people I connect with very deeply.”

“We Met in December” is scheduled to re-air on Hallmark Channel several more times, including on December 28 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. It is also available to stream via Hallmark+. 

I'm actually watching it now, for the 2nd time, as I read this. LOL.  It's one of my favorites.  They have great chemistry.  Well written and well acted.

I love each of you and your movies, but I especially loved the two of you together in this great movie.

Even though  both actors are 2 of my favorites, this was the best of the new Christmas movies of 2025.

Loved Autumn and Niall in this movie. Two of my favorites. I think it is one of the better movies of the season and very much enjoyed the more mature characters they portrayed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","NewJeans' Full-Group Comeback Falters After ADOR Ends Danielle's Contract","https://entertainmentnow.com/k-pop-bands-movies/newjeans-danielle-contract-ended/","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 04:44:04 GMT","

NewJeans' long-awaited full-group return has hit another obstacle after their agency, ADOR, terminated member Danielle Marsh's exclusive contract, complicating plans for the K-pop group's reunion.

ADOR confirmed the decision Monday in a public statement, reported by The Korea Times. The agency said it determined Danielle could no longer continue as both a NewJeans member and a company artist following recent legal rulings and internal discussions.

The announcement comes as ADOR works to stabilize the group after more than a year of legal disputes that stalled NewJeans' activities and placed their future in question. Once seen as one of K-pop's most promising global acts, the group now faces renewed uncertainty just as a comeback appeared possible.

A Seoul court ruled earlier this fall that NewJeans' exclusive contracts with ADOR remain legally binding, according to The Korea Herald. The ruling barred the members from pursuing independent entertainment activities outside the agency and prompted ADOR to reopen negotiations with each member individually.

Following the decision, ADOR said member Hanni agreed to return to the company after traveling to South Korea with her family for discussions. The agency also said Minji remains in talks and has not finalized her position.

Danielle's negotiations, however, ended differently. ADOR said it formally terminated her contract after concluding that continued collaboration was no longer possible. The company did not disclose the specific contractual provisions involved, but framed the move as a necessary step following the court ruling and failed discussions.

In its statement, ADOR also said it plans to pursue legal action against a member of Danielle's family and former ADOR chief executive Min Hee-jin, whom the agency accused of contributing to the prolonged conflict that delayed NewJeans' return.  

The contract termination surprised many fans, particularly after earlier reports suggested all five members had expressed interest in returning to ADOR after the court decision. Danielle, along with Minji and Hanni, had previously been included in discussions about restoring full-group activities, according to Forbes.

NewJeans debuted as a five-member group and quickly rose to international prominence, earning major awards and global chart success. Industry observers say the loss of a founding member could complicate future releases, branding, and tour plans, especially given the group's strong identity as a five-member act.

ADOR has not announced a timeline for NewJeans' next release or performance. With negotiations ongoing and legal tensions unresolved, the group's path forward remains unclear.

What once seemed like a straightforward comeback now reflects the ongoing fallout of a dispute that continues to reshape NewJeans' career, one decision at a time.

In 1986, James Cameron was a young filmmaker under immense pressure as the writer and director of “Aliens,” a big-budget follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi classic. Although tensions were high, he formed several alliances on that movie that would serve him well for decades to come — star Sigourney Weaver, for example, became a key collaborator on later films, up to and including Cameron's latest, “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”

Even more pivotal was Cameron's partnership with special effects artist Stan Winston, who had previously joined forces with the director on “The Terminator” but brought the collaboration to new artistic heights (and an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects) with his designs for “Aliens.” Winston and Cameron reteamed in 1991 for “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (a dual Oscar-winner for Winston in the categories of makeup and visual effects), and it was not long after that film that Cameron and Winston had a fateful conversation.

“I had noodled around with [CG] a bit on ‘The Abyss,' and then we committed to it on ‘Terminator 2' with the liquid metal guy, the T-1000,” Cameron told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “Stan Winston had been my close creative partner on that film, doing the prosthetics part of the T-1000, and then ILM did the CG part.” A couple of years after “Terminator 2,” Cameron visited Winston at his studio, where Winston and his team did a victory lap after completing work on Steven Spielberg's “Jurassic Park.”  

 










“‘Jurassic Park' was also a split,” Cameron said. “It was a hybrid production, very much like ‘T2.' Right after that film, I went over to Stan's studio and saw these people working in Maya — there were, I think, 12 or 15 workstations. I said, ‘Stan, what are you doing?' He said, ‘CG is the future of character and creature creation.' I said, ‘You really believe that?' and he said, ‘Absolutely.' And this is a guy that was based in foam rubber and hydraulics and cables and puppeteering.”

It turns out that Cameron also believed CG was the future, and he convinced Winston to start the visual effects company Digital Domain with him. “Why have 15 people when you can have 500?” Cameron said. “We were ahead of the curve because we had direct experience seeing how powerful [CG] could be, how compelling it could be to the audience. So we went down that path, and we never looked back.”

Digital Domain would create effects not only for Cameron productions like “True Lies” and “Titanic,” but also for everything from Martin Scorsese's “Kundun” to Michael Bay's “Armageddon.” The company's biggest challenge and biggest gamble, however, was on the original “Avatar” in 2009. According to Cameron, it was such a complex endeavor that it wasn't until three years into production that the filmmakers had a single completed shot they could use in the movie. By that time, Winston was ill and no longer coming into work.

 










“I called Stan,” Cameron said. “I knew he was sick. I said, ‘You've got to see this,' and he said all right.” Cameron went to Winston's house the next day and waited for hours with the footage on his laptop, but Winston wasn't up for a visit. “His son Matt came down and said, ‘It's not gonna be today.' I said, ‘All right, I'll come back tomorrow. Came back the next day and the housekeeper answered the door and told me he'd died.”

Even though Winston never saw the first completed shot — or the film as a whole — Cameron considers him a co-author of the “Avatar” series. “He never saw it, but was his vision as much as mine. I always feel like we're carrying his idea on, that it's all about putting something on screen that's compelling, and the more impossible and unexplainable it is, the better, because Stan never wanted you to see the guys with the levers and the cables. He just wanted you to see the magic.”

“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is currently in theaters. To hear the entire conversation with James Cameron and make sure you don't miss a single episode of Filmmaker Toolkit, subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

A funny thing happened when Netflix put the “Stranger Things” finale in theaters: Fans bought tickets. A lot of tickets.

The AMC Kips Bay in New York City listed 11 screenings as “almost full” on New Year's Eve alone. (There are New Year's Day showings, as well.) The 34th Street theater filled up nine screenings, and Lincoln Square had five showings nearing capacity. The same demand was seen on the opposite coast in Los Angeles, where The Grove packed the house for seven screenings, the Century City AMC had eight, and Universal CityWalk turned out 11. Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, and more cities where the finale is playing saw similar demand, and all of these sales took place days before showtime. (These figures were tallied on Sunday, December 28.) By New Year's Eve, Netflix's latest “event” screenings should be even busier.

 








Related Stories Here's What's Entering the Public Domain in 2026 All the ‘Stranger Things' Main Characters Should Live, Actually 

Now, this may not be surprising to some of you — “Stranger Things” is one of the most-watched properties on Netflix and has been for nearly a decade — but it took me off guard. So much of the discussion (online and off) around the last few seasons has skewed negative — egregious episode lengths, repetitive storytelling, lackluster thrills — I forgot that the silent majority either still likes what they're seeing or likes it enough to keep tuning in.

 










Even so, it's one thing to get people to watch at home for the cost of a monthly subscription, and — as many a studio executive will tell you — it's quite another to get people to go out to a theater and buy a ticket. That thousands of people will ring in the new year by watching TV at their local cineplex — despite its simultaneous availability at home, on the same platform where fans have watched every other episode — tells us just how popular the series remains. (And just how popular communal viewing experiences remain.)

I doubt Netflix will announce exactly how well (or how poorly) “Stranger Things” does in its limited theatrical run, but even the anecdotal evidence supports an unconventional path forward for the series. Maybe what's next for the Hawkins gang isn't another series at all. Maybe they should stay in theaters long-term.

OK, before unpacking that plan, I hear you: The finale hasn't even been released yet, so why are we jumping ahead to what's next? Well, because we know “Stranger Things” isn't really going to end with Season 5, Episode 8, “The Rightside Up.” Short-term, there's an animated spinoff, “Stranger Things: Tales from '85,” set to premiere in 2026. Long-term, “Stranger Things” is one of the few properties Netflix can even claim as a legitimate franchise. (Remember when “The Witcher” was a franchise? No? That's because it didn't last long.) Even if the Warner Bros. acquisition goes through, granting Netflix access to the studio's treasure trove of proven I.P., the surviving executives aren't simply going to forget about their old toys because they can now play with Batman and Superman.

 










And believe me: I'd love it if they did forget. “Stranger Things” was originally conceived as a limited series, and each new season only underscored why its narrative wasn't meant for unlimited growth (personified quite well by the main cast's awkward, timeline-shattering growth spurts). A definitive ending would be great! But in a TV era that's revived everything from “Sex and the City” to “The Sopranos” (not to mention raising “Dexter” from the dead), it's absurd to expect more recent hits to wrap things up for good. 

Really, the expansion has already begun. Netflix has been churning out supplemental products in ancillary markets for years, and all of them — the books, games, even the Broadway show — feel like the secondary stories they are. Will the animated spinoff be any better? It's too soon to say, but given it takes place “between Seasons 2 and 3,” I'm not holding my breath. 

So while contemplating what that franchise could look like — aka while staring down the barrel of watching (and reviewing) umpteen “Stranger Things” spinoffs, prequels, and side quests — I came to the (professionally convenient) conclusion that the series needs a reinvention. It shouldn't jump back to show us the origins of Hawkins Laboratory or “fill in the gaps” between preexisting seasons. It shouldn't reboot itself in a new town or a new time period. It shouldn't launch a spinoff centered on Holly Wheeler or “Delightful” Derek. 

 










In other words, “Stranger Things” shouldn't become a universe. It should just make sequels. And those sequels should be movies.

Why? Well, to start with, creators Matt and Ross Duffer have always been preoccupied with movies. Their series is fueled by nostalgia, and that nostalgia largely stems from classic films like “E.T.,” “The Goonies,” and “Alien” (among many, many other influences). Their narrative structure can also skew closer to a long movie than a proper TV show, since seasons tend to distinguish themselves more clearly than episodes do. When trying to pinpoint a notable hourlong arc — not a moment or set piece, but an identifiable story contained within a single episode — my mind first went to the show's biggest flop (Season 2's “The Lost Sister,” in which the Duffer brothers tried their hands at a backdoor pilot).

That catastrophe very much included, it often feels like the Duffers look down on television. They've repeatedly referred to their TV show as a movie, and they eschew TV terminology in describing “Stranger Things” whenever possible: Episodes are called “chapters,” and seasons are labeled like movie sequels. To watch, say, “The West Wing” on Netflix, you'll click a drop-down menu and choose to start with Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, etc. To watch “Stranger Things,” that same drop-down menu simply offers “Stranger Things 2,” Stranger Things 3,” “Stranger Things 4,” or “Stranger Things 5.” “Season” is nowhere to be found.

 










Seasons also don't appear to be their priority going forward. When the brothers moved their overall deal from Netflix to Paramount, they mentioned their “ambition to write, produce, and direct large-scale theatrical films.” Sure, the deal includes TV and streaming projects, too, but including this particular language in the official announcement sure sounds like they'll be concentrating on the big screen for a bit.

So why not let them? Sure, what the Duffer brothers want may be beside the point — I won't pretend to know how to sort out the legal complications between their new deal with Paramount, Netflix's rights to “Stranger Things,” and its pending acquisition of Warner Bros. — but if we assume the creators will somehow be involved in the franchise moving forward, the case for moving forward with movies makes even more sense. Finales kill momentum. Sequels need to bring it back. Not only might movies spark the brothers' creative interest (in a way the last few seasons clearly haven't), but they could also reignite cultural interest.

Call it wishful thinking, but aren't we tired of Hollywood's modern franchise playbook? Everything is connected, every setting is a universe, and every story is worth telling somehow. Maybe it's a limited series that gets turned into an ongoing series, so long as the first season hits. Maybe it's a reboot that brings in a new cast, only to bring back the old cast when audiences are bored with the new one. Maybe it's a spinoff of a spinoff, made mainly to sell soundtracks.

 










For as complicated as these franchise tie-ins can sound, they're easy to see through. People are exhausted with prequels; for every “Andor” there's an “Obi-Wan Kenobi” and a “Book of Boba Fett,” for every “House of the Dragon” there's a “Rings of Power” and “Dune: Prophecy.” Spinoffs aren't as out of favor at the moment, but their long TV history has taught us just how tricky they are to pull off; usually, the best ones require a revamp, like “Frasier” (after “Cheers”) or “The Good Fight” (after “The Good Wife”), or they're so formulaic, they just need to keep the train on the tracks (like your “NCIS” and “Chicago” shows).

“Stranger Things” isn't really conducive to either tack. As much as Netflix would love to launch “Stranger Things: Normal, IL,” the series isn't rooted in a case-of-the-week structure — spinoffs will need their own narrative engines. And as much as Netflix loves spinoffs (“Wednesday,” “The Gentlemen,” “Queer Eye,” every new season of “Monster” — all of which are treated like new shows: accessible to anyone and everyone, with the added benefit of serving as a gateway drug to a preexisting properties), it's moving away from the risks typically required to make good ones. (We're still in the “gourmet cheeseburgers” era.)

So rather than try to turn “Stranger Things” into something it isn't, or play by modern TV's rulebook for expanding a franchise, why not retreat to the relative safety of an old Hollywood strategy? Just make sequels. Bring back as many of the main cast members as you need. (I'm sure many of them will be available for the right price.) Continue the existing story. (If Vecna can just “return” as the Big Bad after Season 4, he can either come back again or, preferably, the Duffers can cook up another creepy villain.) Release a new entry every five years or so (to protect the brand and build anticipation the old-fashioned way — waiting). Plus, TV doesn't need more blockbusters, while movies (and theaters) still do.

 










Ending the series gives the franchise a key opportunity to course-correct. The repetitive plots can be jettisoned. (Dream big for the big screen, Duffer bros.) The exorbitant cast can be culled. (No more new characters to fill out side quests that only exist to pad out an eight-hour season.) The movies can be movie-length without people complaining about two-hour “episodes,” and the narrative timeline can be adjusted to accommodate whoever comes back. (No more 25-year-olds playing teens! Hooray!) Making sequels into movies also fits Netflix's presumed future (with Warner Bros.), and it fits the show's original inspirations. (Here's hoping the sequels' quality skews closer to “Aliens” than “Poltergeist II: The Other Side.”)

But most of all, movies feel like what “Stranger Things” has always wanted to be. The Duffers were inspired by the films of their youth, so let them work out what's next in the same form. After all, TV doesn't need more blockbusters, but movies — and theaters — still do.

“Stranger Things” Season 5, Volume 3 — the series finale — premieres Wednesday, December 31 at 8 p.m. ET on Netflix and in theaters.

The site was going to play a crucial role in defending Britain if nuclear war ever broke out

AN abandoned RAF site dubbed Britain's ‘Area 51' is a magnet for UFO hunters, urban explorers and conspiracy theorists who believe it was once home to government investigations into aliens. 

From the outside, Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire looks like your typical 17th century Grade II listed house set in quiet rural surroundings.

But in 1950 it was taken over and became home to the RAF's police and secret service personnel, covering espionage and counterintelligence.

And thanks to documents released in 2010 it emerged it also dealt with sightings of UFOs, leading to rumours it was hiding parts of flying saucers and even extra-terrestrial corpses recovered from crashes.

Urban explorer Gareth Smith told The Sun: “I've been to Rudloe a total of five times in the past 15 years. The last time I went was a year ago, and it's almost like nature is taking it back.

“I've been there in the daytime and at night, and it's pretty spooky. Inside the buildings there are brambles growing through the walls, upturned desks and chairs, and you definitely feel on edge, as well as the adrenalin pumping.

“Seeing it over the years, every time I went there I went into a different building, and the change is kind of apocalyptic.”

The base was also featured on an episode of the American TV show Ancient Aliens that explores the theory that this was top-secret government research on aliens.

Top secret documents declassified in 2010 confirmed RAF Rudloe, between Corsham and Box in Wiltshire, WAS used as a UFO intelligence base.

It was home to the Flying Complaints Flight, a unit of the RAF Police which gathered reports of UFO sightings near RAF bases and passed them to the Ministry of Defence headquarters.

Ministers heard weekly reports of UFO sightings and Churchill once even ordered one reported meeting between RAF planes and a UFO to be kept secret for at least five decades in order to prevent “mass panic”. 

This is what led to it being dubbed the country's ‘Area 51', after the US Air Force's military base associated with extra-terrestrial  activity including the infamous Roswell incident and government cover-ups.

Wiltshire has long been an epicentre of strange activity, including crop circles, UFOs, and mysterious ancient sites like Stonehenge. 

And to add further intrigue, the base sits on top of a vast maze of underground tunnels and bunkers built in old Bath Stone quarries that was essentially a city able to house as many as 4,000 people.

Government ministers would also have been evacuated to here in case of a nuclear attack on Britain, and there was even a section dedicated to the Royal Family. 

There was also a BBC TV studio that the government would have used to broadcast to the nation while war raged above ground.

Although Rudloe Manor is now a separate dwelling belonging to a local family, the RAF site and its 40 prefabricated buildings still lay abandoned, surrounded by security fences topped with razor wire.

Today, a metal gate covers the old entrance bearing the sign ‘private, keep out', windows of the huts are boarded up or smashed out, while several oil tanks capable of holding 6,000 gallons lie peeling, covered in graffiti and vandalised.

Dog walkers use the old access road for exercise, but locals remain tight-lipped for fear of inviting more conspiracy theorists or intruders.

Despite the efforts made to secure the compound, those determined enough to battle through the brambles and scale or slip through the fencing have been able to explore the eerily quiet site and its abandoned buildings.

Gareth added: “I've explored the camp but never got into the house itself, it would have been pointless. It was left for 20 years in a state of dilapidation. I know someone who's really into UFOs who got into Rudloe Manor, but it was just a shell, just rooms blocked off with breeze blocks and in a complete state of disrepair.

“I've only been in the old RAF buildings though. I just find the way somewhere can be left as it was with signs of what used to go on there just fascinating.

“It became known as the UK's Area 51 because of the rumours of UFO investigations and then some suggested there were old parts of the spacecraft or even aliens. 

“It doesn't make sense there was anything like that, because it was a non-flying military base, it had no runways. They would have investigated reports of the unexplained in the air, and I'm sure that's still done somewhere else today.

We've always known about the UFO rumours, some people want it to be true because it's more interesting

“We've all seen videos of unexplained objects in the air, or UFOs, but personally I think most things can be explained, so I think it's a pretty bold claim there was ever anything like that at Rudloe, other than documents.

“Last year when I went, I didn't get past the boundary because there was security to stop the many people they had breaking in there.”

A source close to the new owners of Rudloe Manor claims the property, which lay empty for 20 years before it was renovated, is still regularly targeted for its historical link to the UFO reports.

They told The Sun: “People talk of Rudloe Manor like it's still connected to the RAF base, but it's just a family home now and has been since it was sold in 2021.

“That hasn't stopped people breaking in sadly. It's happened at least twice in the past few months, with people even trying to take pictures of the children.”

One woman who did not want to be identified said: “We've always known about the UFO rumours, some people want it to be true because it's more interesting.

“The tunnels have long been closed, some of them are believed to be demolished when some of the old Rudloe buildings were crushed into the ground.

“Some people believe parts of a spaceship housed there, but I don't think it is true.

						THE mystery surrounding Area 51 has always entertained the public eye, with many theorising what lies behind the top-secret government base.					

Area 51 is located in the southern portion of Nevada, just 83 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas, and is the common name of a highly classified at the United States Air Force facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range.

The airbase is commonly believed by many to be the home of the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems.

The US Air Force acquired the site in 1955.

However, the CIA never acknowledged the existence of the facility until June 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act request filed in 2005.

The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories, as some believe the facility is used to house alien technology or extraterrestrial life.

The base has never been declared a secret base, but all research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.

Conspiracy theorists believe the facility is used to store, examine and reverse engineer crashed alien spacecraft, including material supposedly recovered from the 1950s Roswell crash.

The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.

History.com calls the Roswell incident the “mother of all UFO sightings.”

In July 1947, a rancher found “mysterious debris” and soldiers from a nearby base came to collect the materials.

Then came a giant leap as newspapers reported that a “flying saucer” went down in a New Mexico city.

Australian actress Rose Byrne has opened up about her experience filming the genre-bending new movie “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” highlighting the “supernatural charm” of her co-star, A$AP Rocky, reports film-news.com.

In the film, Byrne plays Linda, a woman navigating the complexities of motherhood who forms an unlikely bond with a motel superintendent, played by the American rapper. While the pairing might suggest a typical Hollywood romance, Byrne insists the film avoids such tropes.



“Rocky has such a supernatural charm you immediately and understandably think, ‘Oh, this is going to happen,' but it never falls into that cliché,” Byrne told Marie Claire Australia.

Byrne was immediately drawn to the project after reading Mary Bronstein's script, describing the writing as “on fire” and packed with “gallows humour.” The actress was particularly struck by the film's unique sound design and its ability to blur the lines between reality and delusion.

“The audience is really only in her perspective and, like her, isn't sure what's real and what isn't,” Byrne explained. “It defies a lot of genres.”

Beyond the technical brilliance of the film, Byrne expressed pride in its raw depiction of motherhood. She noted that the role has resonated deeply with women who often feel “invisible” in their daily lives.

Byrne welcomed the recent wave of female-led projects, such as Nightbitch and All Fours that explore the maternal experience through a female lens.

“Until recently, there's not been much dialogue about motherhood from a female perspective,” she said. “I look at my mother's generation and think, ‘They didn't have this at all.' This is an extraordinary time.”

It was one of the nation's most important mysteries for nearly five years. Hours before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, someone placed pipe bombs outside Republican and Democratic headquarters in Washington, D.C., leading to a lengthy manhunt.

Earlier this month, there was a breakthrough. Federal agents arrested a suspect on Dec. 4, taking Brian Cole Jr. into custody. The Virginia man, who lives roughly 23 miles south of Capitol Hill, has been charged with transporting an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials, according to charging documents filed in court.

What was unclear at the time, however, was the suspect's possible motives. According to the latest court filing from federal prosecutors, an answer is coming into focus. The Associated Press reported:

The man accused of placing two pipe bombs in Washington on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol told investigators after his arrest that he believed someone needed to ‘speak up' for people who believed the 2020 election was stolen and that he wanted to target the country's political parties because they were ‘in charge,' prosecutors said Sunday.

The same Justice Department memo said that Cole confessed to placing the pipe bombs during an interview with FBI officials.

The AP's report added that, according to prosecutors, Cole “acknowledged feeling disillusioned by the 2020 election, fed up with both political parties and sympathetic to claims by [Donald] Trump and some of his allies that the contest had been stolen.”

The same court filing quoted Cole telling agents who interviewed him that if people “feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being — you know, relegated null and void, then, like, someone needs to speak up, right?”

In reality, of course, the election had not been tampered with, but the suspected pipe bomber apparently believed Trump's lies about his 2020 election defeat.

As a political matter, the apparent motivations are relevant. The New York Times reported that conspiracy theorists on the right spent years focused on the pipe bomb case, “alleging that shadowy government forces had planted the explosives as a distraction to make it easier for the Capitol to be stormed, in an effort to ultimately blame the breach on Mr. Trump and his supporters.”

Among those touting this apparent nonsense was FBI Deputy Director Don Bongino, a former conspiratorial podcast personality, who told listeners to his conservative podcast shortly before Election Day 2024 that there was “a massive cover-up” in the pipe-bombs case and that the bombs might've been placed as part of an “inside job” launched by the federal government.

Earlier this year, Bongino went further, telling his audience that the FBI knew the identity of the bomber and “just doesn't want to tell us because it was an inside job.”

If the Justice Department's legal memo is correct, we now know that the right's conspiracy theories were completely wrong, though it remains unclear whether Bongino and other conservatives who pushed these discredited ideas will now acknowledge their mistake. Watch this space.

Google's proposal to explore space-based AI infrastructure raises fundamental questions about energy, physics and feasibility – and whether Earth has really run out of options.

As artificial intelligence (AI) models keep growing and getting more power-hungry, researchers are starting to ask not whether they can be trained — but where. That's the context behind Google Research's recent proposal to explore space-based AI infrastructure, an idea that sits somewhere between serious science and orbital overreach.

The idea, dubbed ""Project Suncatcher"" and outlined in a study uploaded Nov. 22 to the preprint arXiv database, explores whether future AI workloads could be run on constellations of satellites equipped with specialized accelerators and powered primarily by solar energy.

In certain low Earth or sun-synchronous orbits, the argument goes, solar panels can operate for much of the time, avoiding many of the night-day cycles, atmospheric losses and grid constraints that limit terrestrial data centers. Heat, meanwhile, would be rejected into space via radiative cooling rather than relying on water-intensive cooling systems on Earth.

The push to look beyond Earth for AI infrastructure isn't coming out of nowhere. Data centers already consume a non-trivial slice of the world's power supply: recent estimates put global data-center electricity use at roughly 415 terawatt-hours in 2024, or about 1.5% of total global electricity consumption, with projections suggesting this could more than double by 2030 as AI workloads surge.

Utilities in the U.S. are already planning for data centers, driven largely by AI workloads, to account for between 6.7-12% of total electricity demand in some regions by 2028, prompting some executives to warn that there simply “isn't enough energy on the grid” to support unchecked AI growth without significant new generation capacity.

In that context, proposals like space-based data centers start to read less like sci-fi indulgence and more like a symptom of an industry confronting the physical limits of Earth-bound energy and cooling. On paper, space-based data centers sound like an elegant solution. In practice, some experts are unconvinced.

Joe Morgan, COO of data center infrastructure firm Patmos, is blunt about the near-term prospects. ""What won't happen in 2026 is the whole ‘data centers in space' thing,"" he told Live Science. ""One of the tech billionaires might actually get close to doing it, but aside from bragging rights, why?""

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Morgan points out that the industry has repeatedly flirted with extreme cooling concepts, from mineral-oil immersion to subsea facilities, only to abandon them once operational realities bite. ""There is still hype about building data centers under the ocean, but any thermal benefits are far outweighed by the problem of replacing components,"" he said, noting that hardware churn is fundamental to modern computing.

That churn is central to the skepticism around orbital AI. GPUs and specialized accelerators depreciate quickly as new architectures deliver step-change improvements every few years. On Earth, racks can be swapped, boards replaced and systems upgraded continuously. In orbit, every repair requires launches, docking or robotic servicing — none of which scale easily or cheaply.

""Who wants to take a spaceship to update the orbital infrastructure every year or two?"" Morgan asks. ""What if a vital component breaks? Actually, forget that, what about the latency?""

Latency is not a footnote. Most AI workloads depend on tightly coupled systems with extremely fast interconnects, both within data centers and between them. Google's proposal leans heavily on laser-based inter-satellite links to mimic those connections, but the physics remains unforgiving. Even at low Earth orbit, round-trip latency to ground stations is unavoidable.

""Putting the servers in orbit is a stupid idea, unless your customers are also in orbit,"" Morgan said. But not everyone agrees it should be dismissed so quickly. Paul Kostek, a senior member of IEEE and systems engineer at Air Direct Solutions, said the interest reflects genuine physical pressures on terrestrial infrastructure.

""The interest in placing data centers in space has grown as the cost of building centers on earth keeps increasing,"" Kostek said. ""There are several advantages to space-based or Moon-based centers. First, access to 24 hours a day of solar power… and second, the ability to cool the centers by radiating excess heat into space versus using water.""

From a purely thermodynamic standpoint, those arguments are sound. Heat rejection is one of the hardest limits on computation, and Earth-based data centers are increasingly constrained by water availability, grid capacity and local environmental opposition.

The backlash against terrestrial AI infrastructure isn't limited to energy and water issues; health fears are increasingly part of the narrative. In Memphis, residents near xAI's massive Colossus data center have voiced concern about air quality and long-term respiratory impacts, with community members reporting worsened symptoms and fear of pollution-linked illnesses since the facility began operating. In other states, opponents of proposed hyperscale data center projects have framed their resistance around potential health and environmental harms, arguing that large facilities could degrade local air and water quality and exacerbate existing public health burdens.

Putting data centers into orbit would remove some constraints, but replace them with others.

""The technology questions that need to be answered include: Can the current processors used in data centers on Earth survive in space?” Kostek said. ""Will the processors be able to survive solar storms or exposure to higher radiation on the Moon?""

Google researchers have already begun probing some of those questions through early work on Project Suncatcher. The team describes radiation testing of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and modeling of how tightly clustered satellite formations could support the high-bandwidth inter-satellite links needed for distributed computing. Even so, Kostek stresses that the work remains exploratory.

""Initial testing is being done to determine the viability of space-based data centers,"" he said. ""While significant technical hurdles remain and implementation is still several years away, this approach could eventually offer an effective way to achieve expansion.""

That word — expansion — may be the real clue. For some researchers, the most compelling rationale for off-world computing has little to do with serving Earth-based users at all. Christophe Bosquillon, co-chair of the Moon Village Association's working group for Disruptive Technology & Lunar Governance, argues that space-based data centers make more sense as infrastructure for space itself.

""With humanity on track to soon establish a permanent lunar presence, an infrastructure backbone for a future data-driven lunar industry and the cis-lunar economy is warranted,"" he told Live Science.

From this perspective, space-based data centers aren't substitutes for Earth's infrastructure so much as tools for enabling space activity, handling everything from lunar sensor data to autonomous systems and navigation.

""Affordable energy is a key issue for all activities and will include a nuclear component next to solar power and arrays of fuel cells and batteries,"" Bosquillon said, adding that the challenges extend well beyond engineering to governance, law and international coordination.

—Why do AI chatbots use so much energy?

—'Rainbow-on-a-chip' could help keep AI energy demands in check — and it was created by accident

—Scientists say they've eliminated a major AI bottleneck — now they can process calculations 'at the speed of light'

Crucially, space-based computing could offload non-latency-sensitive workloads from Earth altogether. ""Solving the energy problem in space and taking that burden off the Earth to process Earth-related non-latency-sensitive data… has merit,"" Bosquillon said, even extending to the idea of space and the Moon as a secure vault for ""civilisational"" data.

Seen this way, Google's proposal looks less like a solution to today's data center shortages and more like a probe into the long-term physics of computation. As AI approaches planetary-scale energy consumption, the question may not be whether Earth has enough capacity, but whether researchers can afford to ignore environments where energy is abundant but everything else is hard.

For now, space-based AI remains strictly experimental. Whether it ever escapes Earth's gravity may depend less on solar panels and lasers than on how desperate the energy race becomes.

Scientists discover 26 new bacterial species in NASA cleanrooms, revealing surprisingly resilient microbes with potential uses in biotechnology and medicine.

NASA's cleanrooms rank among the cleanest spaces on Earth, and for good reason — these sterile spaces are fortified to prevent even the hardiest Earth microbes from hitching a ride to other worlds aboard NASA spacecraft. Yet even in the most sterile places on Earth, life finds a way.

Now, experts plan to test these newfound bugs inside a ""planetary simulation chamber"" that could reveal whether these microbes, or ones with similar adaptations, could survive a trip through space to Mars, possibly contaminating the alien worlds on arrival.

Earlier this year, scientists identified more than two dozen previously unknown bacterial species lurking in the Kennedy Space Center cleanrooms in Florida, where NASA assembled its Phoenix Mars Lander in 2007. The discovery showed that despite constant scrubbing, harsh cleaning chemicals and extreme nutrient scarcity, some microbes evolved a suite of genetic tricks that allowed them to persist in these punishing environments.

""It was a genuine 'stop and re-check everything' moment,"" study co-author Alexandre Rosado, a professor of Bioscience at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, told Live Science about the findings, which were described in a paper published in May in the journal Microbiome. While there were relatively few of these microbes, they persisted for a long time and in multiple cleanroom environments, he added.

Identifying these unusually hardy organisms and studying their survival strategies matters, the researchers say, because any microbe capable of slipping through standard cleanroom controls could also evade the planetary-protection safeguards meant to prevent Earth life from contaminating other worlds.

When asked whether any of these microbes might, in theory, tolerate conditions during a journey to Mars' northern polar cap, where Phoenix landed in 2008, Rosado said several species do carry genes that may help them adapt to the stresses of spaceflight, such as DNA repair and dormancy-related resilience. But he cautioned that their survival would depend on how they handle harsh conditions a microbe would face both during space travel and on Mars — factors the team didn't test — including exposure to vacuum, intense radiation, deep cold and high levels of UV at the Martian surface.

To explore that question, the researchers are now building a planetary simulation chamber at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia to expose the bacteria to Mars-like and space-like conditions, Rosado said. The chamber, now in its final assembly phase, with pilot experiments expected to begin in early 2026, is engineered to mimic stresses such as the low, carbon-dioxide-rich air pressure of Mars, high radiation, and the extreme temperature swings the microbes would face during spaceflight. These controlled environments will allow scientists to investigate how hardy microbes adapt and survive under combinations of stresses comparable to those encountered during spaceflight or on the Martian surface, said Rosado.

NASA's spacecraft-assembly cleanrooms are engineered to be hostile to microbes — a cornerstone of the agency's efforts to prevent Earth organisms from hitchhiking to worlds beyond Earth — through continuously filtered air, strict humidity control and repeated treatments using chemical detergents and UV light, among other measures.

Even so, ""cleanrooms don't contain 'no life,'"" said Rosado. ""Our results show these new species are usually rare but can be found, which fits with long-term, low-level persistence in cleanrooms.""

During the Phoenix lander's assembly at the Kennedy Space Center's Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility, a team led by study co-author Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who is a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, collected and preserved 215 bacterial strains from the cleanroom floors. Some samples were gathered before the spacecraft arrived in April 2007, again during assembly and testing in June, and once more after the spacecraft moved to the launch pad in August, according to the study.

At the time, researchers lacked the technology to classify new species precisely or in large numbers. But DNA technology has advanced dramatically in the 17 years since that mission, and today scientists can sequence almost every gene these microbes carry and compare their DNA to broad genetic surveys of microbes collected from cleanrooms in later years. This allows scientists ""to study how often and for how long these microbes appear in different places and times, which wasn't possible in 2007,"" said Rosado.

Further analysis revealed a suite of survival strategies. Many of the newly identified species carry genes that help them resist cleaning chemicals, form sticky biofilms that anchor them to surfaces, repair radiation-damaged DNA or produce tough, dormant spores — adaptations that help them survive in tucked-away corners or microscopic cracks, the study reports. This makes the microbes ""excellent test organisms"" for validating the decontamination protocols and detection systems that space agencies rely on to keep spacecraft sterile, Rosado said.

From a broader research standpoint, Rosado said the next step is coordinated, long-term sampling across multiple cleanrooms using standardized methods, paired with controlled experiments that measure microbes' survival limits and stress responses, said Rosado.

""This would give us a much clearer picture of which traits truly matter for planetary protection and which might have translational value in biotechnology or astrobiology,"" he said.

      Love me a good philosophical conversation or debate and everyone is entitled to their world view. However, when one goes into it with the sole intention to dissuade curiosity I gotta draw a line lol
    


      To me, a fundamental part of the human experience is asking questions and seeking answers. The only place where that's invariably a bad thing is at church 😬😬😬 and it ain't even Sunday lol
    


      There are so many great mysteries still left in the world. What's wrong with trying to put the pieces together to have a few less blank spots in our understanding of it? 🤔🧐
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are diverse and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed cases, along with the perspectives of various Redditors:
    


      Many Redditors find the statements from high-ranking officials and credible individuals particularly compelling:
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""It is time for the truth to be brought out. Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      Personal accounts, especially when detailed and potentially corroborated, are often considered convincing:
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: A Redditor describes seeing a silent, rectangular craft with curved corners and three large, dim, almost organic lights. ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



      Another Redditor shared a similar experience: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



      When multiple sightings match in description, it can add credibility:
    


Portugal and San Diego Sightings: A Redditor highlights the striking similarity between a UFO sighting in Portugal from the 90s and a video from San Diego in 2015. ""The ufo that the San Diego man recorded, matches exactly like the one reported in the Portugal sighting...""



      Another Redditor notes: ""There's definitely credibility with consistency in sightings, provided that these are two separate instances""



      While rare, official reports can offer a more objective perspective:
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: The Condon Committee report suggested a mechanical device of unknown origin. ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting.""



      It's important to consider skeptical explanations, which are also prevalent on Reddit:
    


Factual Errors in Official Accounts: One Redditor points out factual inaccuracies in the list of credible people, which can undermine the overall credibility. [""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Why Trump's ‘terrific' meeting with Zelensky was also pretty good for Putin","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/29/world/trump-meeting-zelensky-ukraine-terrific-putin-intl","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:49:30 GMT","


            It seemed, at least superficially, to have been one of the better face-to-face meetings between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, their sixth in a year that has seen this relationship fray to breaking point and require regular and painstaking repairs.
    


            The mood, as they emerged from the dining room at Mar-a-Lago was conciliatory. Zelensky wore a suit – the same austere black compromise statement he had worn at the White House in October. Trump called the meeting “terrific” and asked if Zelensky and his general who “looks like central casting” had enjoyed the food. Awkward, yes, but a far cry from the open humiliation of the Ukrainian leader that played out in the Oval Office in February.
    


            And yet, beneath the veil of politeness, there was rhetoric from the US president that suggests his default position in negotiations is still to pressure Kyiv, while appeasing Moscow.
    


            On the toughest question of all – territory – Trump at one point suggested it might anyway be “taken” in the coming months,  asking, “are you better off making a deal now?” It was a line eerily similar to that of Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, summarizing a call between President Vladimir Putin and Trump earlier on Sunday: “Given the situation on the front lines, it would make sense for the Ukrainian regime to adopt this decision regarding Donbas without delay.”
    


            That echo wasn't lost on the Kremlin. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted on a call with journalists that Trump “apparently reminded them (the Ukrainian side) that Ukraine is losing land and will continue to lose it.” While Russian forces continue to inch forward in the eastern Donbas region, Putin has demanded that Ukraine cede land that Russia has yet to seize.
    


            The Kremlin would already have been confident in its power to sway the US president. In the lead-up to the Alaska summit between Trump and Putin in August, European leaders worked hard to bring Trump round to the idea that a ceasefire was needed before peace negotiations, something Moscow has always dismissed. In the end, it was Putin who won that argument, and, more than four months later, Trump still appears to support his view.
    


            “He (Putin) feels that, look, you know, they're fighting to stop and then if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn't want to be in that position. I understand that position,” Trump said Sunday.
    


            The apparent removal of a ceasefire from the table has now created a new impasse.  While Ukraine is sounding increasingly open to discussion of territorial concessions, Zelensky has made it clear that giving up, or changing the status of, Ukrainian land would likely require a referendum, something he says cannot happen without a ceasefire lasting at least 60 days.
    


            No ceasefire then means no referendum, and no referendum could mean no territorial concessions from Ukraine, and ultimately no deal. So, we're back on the diplomatic merry-go-round, buying more and more time for Russia to attack.
    


            “Russia wants to continue to put pressure on us. And what does this continuation look like? War, missiles, artillery,” Zelensky said in comments to journalists Monday morning. As he spoke, most Ukrainian regions started a new week with regular blackouts, and more than 9,000 households in the Kyiv region woke up with no power at all.
    


            Hardly surprising then, that the Ukrainian president shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other as he listened to Trump describe Putin as “very good” on the issue of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia seized by force in March 2022 and has occupied ever since.
    


            “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open. That's a big step when he's not bombing that plant,” said the US president.
    


            The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently undergoing repairs to nearby power lines to prevent a nuclear accident, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The facility has been cut off from its external power supply 12 times since Russia's occupation, and earlier this month the UN's nuclear watchdog warned that Moscow's constant attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure are also a threat to its security. “Persistent instability in Ukraine's electrical grid continues to undermine nuclear safety,” said Director General Rafael Grossi.
    


            On one critical issue for Ukraine there has been a small step forward: security guarantees. Up until now, Kyiv only had verbal assurances the US would participate in post-war security guarantees, after Trump shifted his position in August. Now these assurances are in writing, albeit with a 15-year expiry date – which Zelensky wants extended – and still in need of congressional approval. The guarantees would not mean US troops on the ground, but at least there would be support for Europe if they decided to send theirs. “We're going to help Europe 100%, like they'd help us,” said Trump.
    


            And yet until Russia and Ukraine can come together for direct talks, which Zelensky hopes could happen in January after another circuit of discussions with allies, all of this is hypothetical.  That prospect seemed even more remote Monday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Kyiv of attacking one of Putin's residences, promising Moscow would “review” its negotiating position as a result. Zelensky rejected the claim as “another lie” from Russia.
    


            Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, reiterated Monday that Russia wants “the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from Donbas beyond its administrative borders.”  That, of course, includes territory Russia hasn't been able to occupy in nearly four years of war. And in return Moscow continues to receive praise and diplomatic overtures from the White House, with Trump speaking to Putin both before and after his meeting with Zelensky.
    


Takeaways from Trump's meeting with Zelensky in Florida



            The diplomatic merry-go-round revs up again now going into 2026, with adviser-level meetings followed by a gathering of the “Coalition of the Willing” in Paris in early January, and then a potential Washington summit with Trump, Zelensky said Monday. Meanwhile the Trump administration has proposed that discussions continue in several working groups, an idea endorsed by Moscow.
    


            And yet in this now largely predictable cycle, you can't rule out a sudden shift. In October, a frustrated Trump slapped sanctions on Russia's oil giants, a move that has caused Russian oil prices to plummet to their lowest level since the February 2022 invasion.
    


            “Maybe the tug of war for Trump is not lost for Ukraine yet. The leaders are meeting, conversations ongoing,” wrote Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at London-based think tank Chatham House in a post on X.  Former Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev struck a less optimistic tone. “If you want to delay anything for (an) indefinitely long time – create a few working groups,” he wrote.

US Undersecretary of State Sarah Rogers has defended Washington's decision to sanction several Europeans, saying that “extraterritorial censorship of Americans” undermines free speech and innovation. Last week, the US State Department imposed sanctions on five individuals, including British nationals Imran Ahmed and Clare Melford, German citizens Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, and former EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said those targeted had “led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Rogers said the measures were aimed at protecting free expression and the competitiveness of the US technology sector. “These are people who, in many cases, took government money to destroy American businesses for the purpose of suppressing American speech,” she said. “These are, ultimately, serious decisions that rest with the Secretary of State and take into account all of our foreign policy priorities. But free speech is one of those priorities, and so is the continued ability of the American tech sector to lead and innovate,” she added.

The sanctions come amid a widening dispute between the US and the EU over online speech regulation, digital platform governance, and the reach of national laws beyond their borders. Elon Musk, whose platform X was fined about €120 million ($140 million) by EU regulators for what they described as violations of transparency rules set out in the bloc's Digital Services Act, welcomed the move, calling it “so great.” Earlier, Musk blasted the penalty, calling the EU a “bureaucratic monster” that should be abolished, while accusing Brussels of trying to pressure X into censoring speech. French President Emmanuel Macron, who appointed Breton himself, accused Washington of “coercion and intimidation.” UK Labour MP Chi Onwurah said banning individuals over speech disputes undermines the free speech the US administration claims to defend. The rift was reflected in Washington's latest National Security Strategy, which warned that the EU faces potential “civilizational erasure” due to curbs on free speech, suppression of political opposition, and regulatory pressure on innovation.

            The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for UN humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump's administration continues to slash US foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to “adapt, shrink or die” in a time of new financial realities.
    


            The money is a small fraction of what the US has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States' status as the world's largest humanitarian donor.
    


            The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of US demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.
    


            The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional US humanitarian funding for UN-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to UN data. US officials say only $8 to $10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its UN membership.
    


            Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease and harmed US soft power around the world.
    


            The move caps a crisis year for many UN organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in US foreign aid, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.
    


            The announced US pledge for aid programs of the United Nations — the world's top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of US humanitarian aid money — takes shape in a preliminary deal with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.
    


            Even as the US pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.
    


            The cuts will have major implications for UN affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the US this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration — or even during Trump's first term.
    


            Now, the idea is that Fletcher's office — which last year set in motion a “humanitarian reset” to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent — will become a funnel for US and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered US contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid.
    


            The United States wants to see “more consolidated leadership authority” in UN aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the US diplomatic mission in Geneva.
    


            Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office “are going to control the spigot” on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.
    


            “This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars — providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,” said US Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.
    


            US officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA's annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year. Other traditional UN donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year.
    


            “The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,” the State Department said in a statement. “Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.”
    


            “Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.'s most critical work,” the department added. “Today's agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump's commitment to remaining the world's most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.”
    


            At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.
    


            One of the world's most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Trump's as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan.
    


            The project, months in the making, stems from Trump's longtime view that the world body has great promise, but has failed to live up to it, and has — in his eyes — drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.
    


            Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, “At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly plans to ask US President Donald Trump to approve or join new military strikes against Iran's ballistic missile facilities, The Washington Post has claimed ahead of their meeting on Monday.

In June, the US and Israel conducted a joint airstrike campaign against Iranian nuclear sites. The attack was initiated despite prior assessments from US intelligence and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which found no evidence that Iran was actively building a nuclear weapon.

The Washington Post reported that Netanyahu is expected to brief Trump on Monday about Israeli intelligence suggesting that Iran is rapidly reconstituting its ballistic missile program, damaged earlier this year.

The outlet stated that Netanyahu will seek a “green light for another strike against the Islamic republic's ballistic missile program, possibly as part of a joint operation with the US.”

Monday's meeting comes amid visible strain between the two leaders. CNN has reported that Trump has “grown wary of Israeli actions” and that their relationship has “become strained” as Netanyahu has repeatedly asked Trump to approve more aggressive military actions in the region this year.

A fresh point of friction emerged last week when Israel unilaterally recognized the breakaway region of Somaliland, a move condemned by bodies like the African Union and Arab League, and nations including Türkiye and Saudi Arabia. When asked if Washington would follow Israel's lead, Trump pointedly told the New York Post, “No.”

Analysts cited by The Washington Post suggest Trump, who has touted his role as a Middle East peacemaker, may be reluctant to authorize new strikes that could ignite a broader conflict. The leaders are also at odds over implementing the Gaza ceasefire, with the US pushing its peace plan while Israel has been reluctant to withdraw forces.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., defends her COVID-era MEALS Act amid USDA fraud allegations, telling Fox News Digital she doesn't regret the bill.

A pair of companies owned by Tim Mynett, the husband of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., have exploded in value in recent years, growing more than 20 times in under a year, according to congressional disclosures, prompting questions about how the companies achieved their apparent rapid success.

It's a picture that contrasts bleakly with mounting revelations of fraud in Minnesota as investigations indicate the losses through abuse of government programs could top $9 billion.

Ballpark revelations about Omar's assets show a steep increase in the value of her husband's company holdings since 2020.

Omar disclosed 2024 evaluations of Rose Lake Capital LLC, a business firm co-founded by her husband, at somewhere between $5 million and $25 million in 2024. Just one year before, in 2023, she reported that the same company's value was between $1 and $1,000. 

Congressional disclosures, categorized in ranges of value, don't provide the precise details of how much a member's holdings are worth. Even so, assuming the smallest possible change year over year, Rose Lake Capital's evaluation has climbed thousands of times in just one year. 

According to Rose Lake Capital's website, the company facilitates deal-making, mergers and acquisitions, banking, politics and diplomacy.

The company roster of employees included an impressive cast of figures like Adam Ereli — a lobbyist and former ambassador to Bahrain under the Obama administration. According to previous versions of the website accessible on an internet archive, the company also brought in former Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and a pair of former associates from the Democratic National Committee (DNC): William Derrough, the former treasurer for the DNC, and Alex Hoffman, a previous chief of staff to the national finance chair.

Mynett, Omar's third husband, co-founded the company in 2022. 

With mounting public pressure on Omar surrounding multi-billion fraud schemes in Minnesota — and questions about whether the congresswoman could have benefited from them — the company has since stripped its website of all its team member names and bios. It's unclear if any of them remain affiliated with the company.

Omar's office did not respond to a request for comment about the company's growth or why it removed the names of its employees.

Similarly, ESTCRU LLC, a winery registered in Santa Rosa, California, that first appeared on Omar's disclosure reports in 2020, reported a value between $1 million and $5 million in 2024. It was evaluated at just $15,000 to $50,000 the year before.

Despite its increased evaluation, the company's portal for purchasing wine doesn't appear to work. The company also lacks a recent social media footprint, with its last post having gone up in January 2023.

LONDON — European stocks closed mixed on Monday, with defense stocks continuing to struggle amid a possible peace deal in Ukraine.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index stood little changed at close, having hit an intraday record high of 589.61 points earlier in the session but finishing the day at 589.35 points, a 0.11% gain.

The U.K.'s FTSE index traded marginally lower, finished down 0.04%. France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX finished 0.10% higher, while and Italy's FTSE MIB was down 0.38%.

European defense stocks dipped following weekend peace talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Stocks fell in the morning and early afternoon but pared some losses in later trading. Shares of Leonardo fell 1.96% and Rheinmetall dropped around 1%, while Renk, Kongsberg, and Saab were also down at the close. The Stoxx Europe aerospace and defense index was 1.53% lower.

While peace talks could lead to a setback for defense stocks, Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen told CNBC that ""it will quickly be apparent that the investments needed in defense in Europe will continue and they will accelerate massively over the next years."" 

""Definitely a positive potential for European equities if we get some kind of peace,"" Pedersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

Silver climbed above $80 an ounce for the first time early Monday before pulling back. The precious metal was last seen trading at $71.55 an ounce. Gold dropped 1.6% to last trade at $4,355 an ounce, and copper fell 4.2% to $5.59 an ounce.

Trading volumes could be lighter this week, given the ongoing Christmas holidays and with regional markets set to close on Thursday for New Year's Day.

Oil prices rose as investors weighed the prospects of a deal to end the war in Ukraine, though the prospect of a deal before the year's out is fading after Trump and Zelenskyy said on Sunday that progress had been made during talks to end the war but that ""one or two very thorny issues"" remained.

U.S. crude oil rose 2.3% to $58.04 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent gained 2% to $61.89. Both benchmarks fell about 2% on Friday.

Ukraine and Russia remain far apart when it comes to territorial concessions demanded by Russia and security guarantees coveted by Ukraine. 

Speaking to reporters following talks in Florida on Sunday, Zelenskyy said they had come to an agreement on around ""90%"" of a 20-point peace plan and that the leaders had fully agreed on security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump was slightly less bullish on that front, saying an agreement was ""close to 95%"" done.

There are no major European earnings or data releases on Monday.

China launched its most extensive war games around Taiwan on Monday to showcase Beijing's ability to cut off the island from outside support in a conflict, testing Taipei's resolve to defend itself and its arsenal of U.S.-made weapons.

The Eastern Theatre Command said it had deployed troops, warships, fighter jets and artillery for its ""Justice Mission 2025"" exercises to encircle the democratically governed island, conduct live fire and simulated strikes on land and sea targets, and drills to blockade Taiwan's main ports.

The live-firing exercises will continue on Tuesday across a record seven zones designated by China's Maritime Safety Administration, making the drills the largest to date by total coverage and in areas closer to Taiwan than previous exercises. The military had initially said artillery firing would be confined to five zones.

Taiwan's Defence Ministry said there was also an additional zone for a two-hour drill on Monday morning, which took place without a Chinese announcement in the island's eastern waters.

The Transport Ministry said more than 100,000 passengers on scheduled international flights will be affected by Tuesday's drills, while around 80 domestic flights are set to be cancelled.

China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island, follows stronger rhetoric promoting Beijing's territorial claims in response to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggesting a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.

""Our armed forces operate on the principle of preparing for the worst and must take every possible scenario into account,"" Hsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence at Taiwan's defence ministry, told reporters when asked about Tuesday's drills.

""Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... would not only constitute military pressure on us, but could also pose more complex challenges and impacts for the international community and neighbouring countries.""

The exercises began 11 days after the U.S. announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings that the military would ""take forceful measures"" in response.

""They (China) are sending a strong message on external interference,"" said Chieh Chung, a researcher at Taiwan's Institute for National Defence and Security Research, pointing to how China had ""completely cut off"" air and sea links with Japan for three zones to Taiwan's north.

Analysts say Beijing's drills increasingly blur the line between routine military training exercises and what could be a prelude to an attack, a strategy intended to give the U.S. and its allies minimal warning of an assault.

The Chinese military also released a video depicting automated humanoid robots, microdrones and weaponized robotic dogs attacking the island, futuristic technology China has never showcased before.

Fu Zhengyuan, a researcher at the Chinese military's Academy of Military Science, told state media the exercises were justified by concerns over increasing interoperability between Taiwanese and U.S. combat systems, which he said raises the risk of a direct clash between the two superpowers.

Taiwan's government condemned the drills, while its defence ministry posted a video on Facebook showcasing various weapons, including U.S.-made HIMARS rocket systems, a highly mobile artillery system with a range of about 300 km (186 miles) that could hit coastal targets in China's southern province of Fujian, on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, in the event of a conflict.

The island's coast guard said it had deployed large ships to face off against Chinese coast guard vessels near its waters and was coordinating with the military to minimise the drills' impact on maritime routes and fishing grounds.

Taiwan's defence ministry said 89 Chinese military aircraft, 14 military vessels and 14 coast guard boats had been operating around the island on Monday, while four additional warships were also spotted in the Western Pacific.

Authorities said some of the Chinese vessels were engaged in stand-offs with Taiwanese ships near the island's contiguous zone, defined as 24 nautical miles offshore.

The ministry said Taiwan's military was on high alert and poised to carry out ""rapid-response exercises,"" designed to move troops swiftly in case the drills turn into an attack.

Taiwan stock markets were unaffected by the drills, closing up 0.9%.

""I think these drills are just meant to scare us,"" said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher based in the capital, Taipei. ""Similar drills have happened before ... the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan's current government and how they choose to respond.""

The Chinese military released a series of propaganda posters along with a graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.

China's state broadcaster said the exercises would focus on sealing off Taiwan's vital deep-water Port of Keelung to the island's north and Kaohsiung to Taiwan's south, the island's largest port city.

The first poster appeared to show the armada of civilian ships China is mobilizing to help in an attack on Taiwan, vessels with ramps and open decks that could be used to carry out an amphibious assault.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) is one of the best beaten-down technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On December 22, analysts at Citi reiterated a Buy rating on Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) but cut the price target to $325 from $485.

The price target cut comes on the heels of the research firm updating valuation multiples in its digital assets group. Despite the price target cut, the firm remains optimistic about the sector's long-term outlook. Likewise, it has echoed legislative reform expected to catalyze the industry's stocks.

On December 16, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Strategy Inc. at ‘B-' with a stable outlook, noting the company's new U.S. dollar reserve as a credit positive. The reserve helps cover preferred dividends and coupon payments for 12–24 months, reducing liquidity risk during periods of limited market access and delaying any need to sell bitcoin.

On the other hand, between December 8 and December 14, Strategy sold 163,306 shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock. It generated $16.3 million in notional value and $18 million in net proceeds after sales commissions. The company also sold 1.03 million shares of 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (NASDAQ:STRD), with a notional value of $102.9 million and net proceeds of $82.2 million.

During the week, Strategy also acquired 10,645 Bitcoins at an aggregate price of $980.3 million at an average price of $92,098 per Bitcoin. As of December 14, 2025, the company held 671,268 Bitcoin valued at about $50.33 billion.

Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) is a leading Bitcoin treasury company that accumulates Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It also provides AI-powered enterprise analytics software for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence to global customers in sectors like retail, finance, and healthcare, aiming to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

For decades, Donald Trump made much of his money from buildings and golf courses he owned or things he lent this name to like residential towers, vodka, steaks, ties, and mattresses. By the first year of his second term, the mix of revenue sources looked very different. In 2025, Trump's net worth spiked largely because investors poured money into the social media and technology company he founded in 2021 and bought from the crypto currency ventures he started just before taking office. 

After returning to office, Donald Trump's net worth jumped to $7.3 billion, up from $3.9 billion in 2024, according to a tally that Forbes published in September. In mid-December, Trump Media and Technology Group announced a planned merger with TAE Technologies, a company working to develop nuclear fusion technology. That merger was the latest move to raise questions about Trump and conflicts of interests, given that his Administration oversees the regulation of the nuclear industry.

Most modern Presidents before Trump put their assets into blind trusts or broadly diversified funds in order to avoid concerns from the public about the White House favoring policy decisions that would benefit a President financially. Trump didn't do that for his first term, and hasn't done that for his second. Since his inauguration a year ago, he's continued to stay involved in his companies while also entering into new ventures that have soared in value.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in May that Trump was abiding by all applicable conflict-of-interest laws. ""I think everybody, the American public, believe it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,""

Critics argue that Trump has created the impression that he might be willing to make decisions as President that benefit himself and his family over the country. Wealthy individuals and sovereign wealth funds are able to invest in stocks and crypto currencies that could increase the President's wealth and those same investors could launch a fire sale that could reduce their value. “That is a new pressure point on an American President that we've not previously seen, and a reason why Presidents divest from their assets to not have even the appearance of being able to be gotten to through their finances,” says Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a left-leaning nonprofit that tracks the influence of money in government.

Here's a look at how Trump's and his family's wealth has increased over the last year.

Trump was once skeptical of the cryptocurrency industry. In June 2021, Trump said in a Fox Business interview that cryptocurrency generally “seems like a scam” and in August of that year he was back on Fox Business saying crypto is a “disaster waiting to happen”. By the middle of his Presidential campaign to return to office, Trump had changed his tune on crypto. His campaign website invited supporters to send donations in cryptocurrency, saying Trump “stands ready to embrace new technologies that will Make America Great Again.” Crypto firms donated heavily to Trump's campaign and, according to a tally by Fortune, gave $18 million to his inauguration fund. 

By the time he took office, Trump's businesses had made multiple crypto-currency plays. Three days before inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP. Two days later, incoming First Lady Melania Trump launched a meme coin called $MELANIA. Six weeks into Trump's administration, a White House fact sheet quoted Trump as saying: “I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.”

In July, Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrency. The bill specifically created federal regulations that the industry had sought around stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. Earlier that year, Trump had launched USD1, his own stablecoin business.

In September, Forbes estimated that Trump's cryptocurrency ventures had been lucrative for him, estimating his memecoin tokens were worth $709 million, his World Liberty Financial tokens were worth $338 million, and USD1 was valued at $235 million. The value of some of those ventures has since declined.

There are concerns that Trump's crypto assets will lead his Administration to support the kind of relaxed regulations of the industry that would benefit his own investments. “The Trumps' crypto peddling is especially ill-advised because the Administration will regulate crypto products and practices,” wrote the Wall Street Journal editorial board in May.

Trump's social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns his social media platform, Truth Social, was estimated by Forbes in September to be worth $2 billion.  That company reported sales in 2024 of just $3.6 million, and a net loss that year of $401 million, according to Forbes. In December, a company working to develop nuclear fusion called TAE Technologies, announced it is merging with Trump's media company. If that deal goes through, it would put Trump, as a major investor, in competition with energy companies that his Administration regulates. 

A couple of weeks before taking the oath of office, Trump launched a number of new licensing deals. He received millions of dollars in income last year from selling Bibles, watches, guitars, books and fragrances. Trump's 2025 financial disclosure form lists him bringing in $3 million in income in fees from Bibles sold on the website of musician Lee Greenwood, a frequent guest at Trump political rallies. The website says that version of the Bible is “endorsed” by Trump, and shows a photo of Trump holding a Bible with the American flag embossed on the cover along with the words “God Bless The USA.”  His financial disclosure also says he brought in $1 million from sales of the “45” guitar, $2.8 million from Trump watches and $2.5 million from Trump sneakers and fragrances.

Looters stole this 2,700-year-old hell gate. Now, it's back where it belongs.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Sometime in the early 20th century (officials aren't sure exactly when), looters made off with a 2,700-year-old treasure of the Mexican-based Olmecs—one of North America's first major civilizations. The artifact was a six-foot-by-five-foot Olmec Cave Mask, also known as a Portal al Inframundo (“passage to the underworld”), depicting the Olmec jaguar god Tepeyollotlicuhti with its flaring eyes and gaping mouth. 

Originally located in Chalcatzingo in the Mexican state of Morelos—an area famous for its Olmec artwork and iconography—the looted statue went on a decades-long journey, winding in and out of different museums and private collections in the United States. Eventually, this ancient hell gate wound up in Denver  in 2023 and, finally, authorities from the Antiquities Trafficking Unit based in New York City secured the masterpiece. Within a couple months, the long-missing statue made a return trip to Mexico. 

“This incredible, ancient piece is a rare window into the past of Olmec society,” New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a press statement at the time. “Like many other looted antiquities, the Olmec Cave Mask was broken into several different pieces to make the smuggling process simpler.” 

The National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), a group within Mexico's Ministry of Culture (which has been leading the restoration), says the statue was actually broken into 25 pieces. As a result, experts have been working on the piece in situ to “provide greater stability and coherent visual reading,” according to a press release. 

“Some elements that make it up are original, but others, such as a metal structure based on bolts, cement reinforcements and replacements of missing parts and shapes, were added to give it stability again, even though the techniques and materials were not the most appropriate,” INAH's Castro Barrera said in a statement translated into English.

Some of those structural elements will likely remain in place going forward. 

Amazingly, this cultural wonder would've likely never returned to its native soil without the tireless effort of archaeologist David Grove, who was the first to link the Olmec artifact to the one missing from Chalcatzingo. INAH's Mario Córdova Tello eventually proved that the artifact was indeed stolen, and even pinpointed its location in Colorado, in the hands of a private collector in 2008. Tragically, Grove—who was so instrumental in the object's repatriation—died the day before the statue arrived in Mexico. 

Unfortunately, the Tepeyollotlicuhti portal is only one example of the many priceless antiquities that have been looted from native lands and now illegally reside—both knowingly and unknowingly—in collections and museums around the world. But as pressure rises for museums to return these prized treasures, maybe they'll also get a long-awaited trip back home one day.

Known as a kore, this 2,500 year-old-statue is a fusion of ancient aesthetics and a symbol of cultural exchange between the Greeks and the Etruscans.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

At an archaeological site in what used to be the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci, the disembodied head of a young woman began to emerge from the ground, her empty eyes staring through millennia of history. Her marble face had not seen daylight in 2,500 years. 

Before the rise of the Roman Empire, the Etruscan civilization flourished in the western region of central Italy once known as Etruria. Vulci was situated northwest of Rome in what is now the province of Viterbo. As directors of the Vulci Cityscape project, archaeologists Mariachiara Franceschini of the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg and Pau Pasieka of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz were excavating the ruins of this once prosperous ancient metropolis. It was there that they came upon the marble head of a statue mirroring the Greek korai found near the Parthenon in the Athenian Acropolis. It was a rare glimpse into a larger sculpture that shows the extent of Greek influence on Etruscan art and culture.

The face of the nameless woman most likely gazed out from a monumental temple that was discovered in 2020 near Tempio Grande. She had once had a decorative and possibly ritual purpose. With an eerily lifelike smile, she wears a diadem over a crown of hair that has been meticulously carved down to every strand, and while the paint that once brought her to life has long since eroded, she was preserved so well that traces of original paint can still be seen on the marble. While it used to be thought that most of the cultural exchange between Etruria and the Attica region of Greece (also famous for its honey) was evidenced in the form of painted pottery, the head of this kore shows that Hellenic influence reached beyond clay vessels. 

Whoever commissioned this statue must have been one of the Etruscan elite. Marble was an expensive material usually reserved for the religious or funerary art of the upper classes, and the quality of the craftsmanship can still be seen thousands of years later. This level of detail extends to the texture of the kore's hair—its flowing waves are reminiscent of similar Hellenic statues. She is one of the few pieces in this style found outside of Greece. Most previous Etruscan excavations have focused on tombs and necropolis complexes without much investigation of everyday urban life. Unlike the broken columns of ancient Greek and Roman cities that are still standing, no buildings survive in that area. Only their foundations remain.

This kore is now being restored at Rome's Instituto Centrale per il Restauro. Though it is not certain whether she was made for the temple she is now being associated with, that temple rose between the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth century B.C.E. It was also built the same time as another temple that was excavated during the 1950s and dated based on artifacts that were unearthed around its foundations. Crumbling sections of wall made of volcanic rock gave more insight into how the architecture of Vulci evolved over a thousand years of serving as the heart of Etruscan society. 

“We discovered remains from the city's origins that had previously been overlooked in Vulci and are now better able to understand the dynamics of settlement and the road system, besides identifying different functional areas in the city,” Pasieka said in a press release about the discovery of the temple. 

Another impressive Etruscan object with Hellenized features is a massive bronze lamp whose symbolism was a mystery for decades. Its images of forest nymphs and satyrs were finally determined to be revelers of Dionysus, the Greek deity of wine, fertility, ecstasy, mysticism and theatre, who appears as a horned god in ornamental figures that surround them.

One of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background. 

That low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch. 

Electricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space.

And that pace of growth isn't expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.

This confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.

For example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.

Gridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber-optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amid the data center boom.

Several other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it's needed most.

Base Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn't sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.

Other startups, including Texture, Uplight, and Camus, are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.

There's also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid. 

Nvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.

These changes won't happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold. 

Utilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they're also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it's costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability. 

Software, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction. 

And that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It's cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy.

Trump started out with nonsensical accusations that were clearly thinly veiled regime change plans.

I think the passivity towards Ukraine is part of relinquishing as seeing Europe as partners or seeing them as part of strategic value. Russia can take Europe, or Europe can fight back, they are good either way.Because of Maduro and the cocaine, Venezuela is an easy first step. They are both hard to stand up for except in principle. I would not be surprised if Cuba is round two. It's the Truman doctrine on steroids.I even wonder if the idea is to replace cheap Chinese labour with each South American labor eventually.

But how did that strategy work out in Libya? Its an absolute mess. Now its a conduit for African migration into Europe. Who knows what destabilizing Venezuela will do.

However, your point stands. Venezuela stands to benefit from an invasion because the country is unstable and teetering on collapse. It's essentially being sold to the highest bidder. If Russia/China want to put their boots there they will need to defend it and rebuild it. If the US wants to prevent Russia/China from doing that they will need to defend it and rebuild it. The US has far better global power projection and will likely spend considerable resources to ensure it's success as it's also, in some sense, a survival concern for the CONUS itself. I would think it could look a lot 1953 Iran, with the exception that power projection ""down the street"" (so to speak) is much easier to maintain than across the ocean.

Stranger Things has just one more episode left in the tank, which means, for the particularly fearful fans among us, one more chance for the show to make some big sacrifices in its final season to stop Vecna once and for all. The show has definitely been teasing the potential for some big tragedies to occur, but fear not, aforementioned fearful fans: you won't necessarily spend your New Year's Eve in horror as Hawkins' finest get wiped out.

“It's not Game of Thrones. We're not in Westeros. I love Game of Thrones, but it's just a very different type of show than that,” Matt Duffer recently flatly told The Hollywood Reporter about the fatal stakes coming into the final episode of the show. “There's not going to be a Red Wedding situation.”

Instead, the showrunners want the show's end to focus on a feeling of satisfaction, rather than necessarily shock value. “I think some things happen in the finale that are very surprising, but we're not trying to shock or upset anyone,” Duffer continued. “I hope by the time people get to the end of the finale that it just feels like there's something inevitable about what happens, and that it doesn't feel painful but feels satisfying. We'll see.”

But for all that talk of less pain and more resolution, that doesn't necessarily mean there won't be a final sacrifice by anyone on the show… and that it still won't be a prominent character. The Duffer brothers are painfully aware that poor Steve Harrington has been getting death flag after death flag spotted by fans as the show's progressed, making him an oft-dreaded candidate for most likely to die in the series finale—but naturally they're still staying mum until the credits roll on if he'll make it out of the show in one piece.

“But as for Steve's fate. I don't know. I can't say. It would be the next logical step. He keeps getting beaten up more and more,” Matt Duffer joked. “The only way we could take it further is death.”

The final episode of Stranger Things hits both Netflix and theaters in a limited capacity this Wednesday, December 31.

Each year, thousands of satellites at the end of their life fall toward Earth, burning up in the atmosphere. In their wake, they leave a trail of chemicals behind that depletes the ozone layer over time.

This is all part of the plan: ‘Design for Demise' is a standard concept for making satellites that break apart upon reentry, limiting the threat of space junk to other satellites and the Earth below. But as humans launch (and burn up) more satellites than ever before, the environmental consequences are increasing.

Now, researchers from European company MaiaSpace, a subsidiary of ArianeGroup that builds launch vehicles, are flipping the idea on its head: They argue a ‘design for non-demise' approach could help protect the atmosphere from our space robots.

In a recent paper, MaiaSpace staffers Antoinette Ott and Christophe Bonnal argue that a new end-of-life strategy for satellites could reduce negative environmental impacts. Their suggested solution comes with its own challenges, notably the risk of debris falling to the Earth, but finding the right path forward will depend on weighing the dangers of both strategies.

Pollution from reentering satellites has become an increasing threat to the upper atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer in the stratosphere that protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation. When satellites burn up during reentry, they produce tiny particles of aluminum oxide; these oxides catalyze destructive reactions between ozone and atmospheric chlorine that depletes the natural radiation shield.

A 2024 study found that a typical 550-pound (250-kilogram) satellite, estimated to be 30% aluminum by mass, could generate about 66 pounds (30 kilograms) of aluminum oxide nanoparticles when it burns up in the atmosphere. The study showed that a growing number of reentering satellites contributed to a shocking eightfold increase in harmful oxides in Earth's atmosphere over six years.

The new research suggests a ‘design for non-demise' approach might be the better option. Engineers would design satellites capable of surviving the superheated plunge through Earth's atmosphere. The authors of the paper suggest that the satellites would undergo a controlled reentry maneuver to minimize the risk of falling space debris on inhabited areas on the ground.

If a non-demise approach becomes the norm, it's likely to mean higher costs for satellite operators. Their spacecraft would need to be hefty enough to survive reentry, and likely require propulsion systems and fuel to ensure that the satellites land somewhere deep in the Pacific Ocean, far from land or people.

“Space object designing now face a question: should a vehicle be engineered to burn up completely, implying that surviving debris might increase casualty risk, or should it aim to minimize particle and gas emissions into the atmosphere, thereby limiting long-term environmental damage?” the researchers wrote in the paper.

As planned.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TSMC has quietly revealed that it had commenced volume production of chips using its N2 (2nm-class) fabrication process. The company did not issue a formal press release notifying about the production start, but the firm had said multiple times that N2 was on track for volume manufacturing in Q4, so the plan has been fulfilled.

""TSMC's 2nm (N2) technology has started volume production in 4Q25 as planned,"" a statement at TSMC's web page dedicated to 2nm Technology reads.

 




From an improvement standpoint, N2 is designed to deliver a 10%–15% performance gain at the same power, a 25%–30% reduction in power at the same performance, and a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E for mixed designs that include logic, analog, and SRAM. For logic-only designs, transistor density is up to 20% higher than N3E.

*Chip density published by TSMC reflects 'mixed' chip density consisting of 50% logic, 30% SRAM, and 20% analog.**At the same speed. ***At the same power.

TSMC's N2 is the company's first process node to adopt gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, where the gate fully surrounds the channel formed by stacked horizontal nanosheets. This geometry improves electrostatic control, reduces leakage, and enables smaller transistors without sacrificing performance or power efficiency, ultimately increasing transistor density. In addition, N2 also adds super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal (SHPMIM) capacitors to the power delivery network. These offer more than twice the capacitance density of the prior SHDMIM design and cut both sheet resistance (Rs) and via resistance (Rc) by 50%, which improves power stability, performance, and overall energy efficiency.

""N2 is well on track for volume production later this quarter, with good yield,"" said C.C. Wei, chief executive of TSMC, during the company's earnings call in October. ""We expect a faster ramp in 2026, fueled by both smartphone and HPC AI applications.""

What is interesting is that the company began to make 2nm-class chips at its Fab 22, which is located near Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Previously it was expected that TSMC would begin ramping up N2 production at Fab 20 (near Hsinchu, Taiwan), which is adjacent to its new global R&D center, where N2-series fabrication technologies were developed. Fab 20 will likely commence mass production a bit later.

TSMC will be ramping up mass production of N2-based chips at brand-new fabs, which is always a bit tricky. What is noteworthy is that the company will ramp production of both smartphone and larger 'AI' and 'HPC' designs at new fabs (note that HPC is a vague term that describes everything from game console SoCs all the way to heavy-duty server CPUs), which will add some additional complexities. Normally, TSMC ramps new nodes with mobile and small consumer designs.

 




Ramping up two N2-capable fabs at once is a result of strong interest for the new process technology by a variety of TSMC partners, so it needs to offer decent capacity for all of them. Furthermore, starting late 2026, both fabs will be used to build chips on N2P, a performance-enhanced version of N2, and A16, a version of N2P with the Super Power Rail backside power delivery that is aimed at complex AI and HPC processors.

""With our strategy of continuous enhancements, we will also introduce N2P as an extension of our N2 family,"" Wei added. ""N2P features further performance and power benefits on top of N2 and volume production scheduled for second half 2026. We also introduced A16 featuring our best-in-class Super Power Rail, or SPR. A16 is best suited for specific HPC products with complex signal routes and dense power delivery networks. Volume production is on track for second half 2026.""

 December 29, 2025  

Rates of gestational diabetes (GD) in the US rose every year from 2016 to 2024, with a total 36% jump in that 9-year period, new data showed.

The data, from nearly all first live singleton births recorded in the National Center for Health Statistics, also showed that GD rose among all racial and ethnic groups, but with significant differences among them.

The dramatic GD rise “likely reflects several factors including increasing prevalence of prepregnancy overweight and obesity, older maternal age at first birth, and higher rates of metabolic risk factors entering pregnancy. The COVID-19 pandemic may have further contributed to these trends through disruptions in routine preventive care, reduced physical activity, increased psychosocial stress, and weight gain during the pandemic period,” study first author Emily L. Lam, medical student at Northwestern University, Chicago, told Medscape Medical News.

Primary care clinicians “are uniquely positioned to intervene upstream of pregnancy. Optimizing cardiometabolic health prior to pregnancy, such as counseling patients on weight, nutrition, and physical activity, can help reduce the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes and promote cardiometabolic health across the life course,” Lam added.

The 12,617,106 mothers included in the study who had given birth between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2024, had a mean age of 27 years at delivery. Just over half (52.7%) were White, 22.8% were Hispanic, 13.0% were Black, 7.4% were Asian, 0.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.

Over the study period, the age-standardized GD rate rose from 58.2 per 1000 live births in 2016 to 79.3 per 1000 in 2024. The annual percentage increase was 3.8%.

The highest GD rates were among American Indian or Alaska Natives, rising from 113.2 per 1000 in 2016 to 136.7 per 1000 in 2024. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders also had notably high rates, increasing from 93.8 in 2016 to 126.0 per 1000 in 2024. Those two groups also experienced the highest per-year rises, both 4.1%.

Rates among White individuals were lowest, 51.2 and 70.7 per 1000 in 2016 and 2024, respectively.

“We did expect some increase in gestational diabetes, given broader metabolic trends in the US, but the magnitude of this increase and the consistency across almost all racial and ethnic groups were striking,” Lam told Medscape Medical News.

The variation in absolute rates across racial and ethnic groups “was likely associated with heterogeneity in risk factor burden, health behaviors and care access, and social exposures,” Lam and colleagues wrote in their research letter, published online on December 29, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

She told Medscape Medical News, “Gestational diabetes is an early marker of future cardiometabolic risk for both the birthing person and their offspring. Primary care clinicians play a critical role in the postpregnancy period by ensuring appropriate follow-up after a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes and optimizing long-term cardiometabolic health.”

Lam disclosed having no disclosures. Other authors reported receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health.

In adults discharged home after an emergency department visit for dizziness, the 30-day incidence of stroke with disability or death was very low — approximately 1 in 2500 patients.

""In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of stroke hospitalization with disability/mortality for patients discharged from the ED to home after an ED dizziness visit is very low,"" the authors wrote. ""These data are important for contextualizing efforts to optimize outcomes of patients presenting to the ED for dizziness,"" they added.

The study was led by Kevin Kerber, MD, MS, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. It was published online on November 18, 2025, in Annals of Emergency Medicine.

The retrospective study design and potential population bias limited generalizability. Stroke detection could have been influenced by relatively high MRI use (10%) at this center compared with lower MRI utilization at other facilities. Later events were not captured.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders of the National Institutes of Health. The authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

World Cup

 Dan Mullan/Getty Images

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has claimed that World Cup ticket revenue is necessary for sustaining football in 150 countries.

The sport's governing body has faced heavy criticism after ticket prices for the 2026 tournament were revealed, which are the most expensive in World Cup history. Fan group Football Supporters Europe described the prices as “extortionate” and a “monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup.”

After widespread backlash to general ticket prices and those for fans of participating member associations (PMAs), released on December 11, FIFA introduced the “supporter entry tier” five days later, which offers around 1,000 tickets per game for $60 to supporters of the two competing teams.

At the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday, Infantino spoke publicly for the first time since those ticket prices were announced.

“What's crucial is that the revenues that are generated from this are going back to the game all over the world,” said the 55-year-old.

“Without FIFA, there would be no football in 150 countries in the world. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup, which we reinvest all over the world.”

A FIFA spokesperson told The Athletic earlier this month that, in relation to World Cup ticket prices, “the revenue FIFA generates from the World Cup is reinvested to fuel the growth of the game (men, women, youth) throughout FIFA's 211 member associations globally. As a matter of fact, FIFA expects to reinvest more than 90 per cent of its budgeted investments for the cycle 2023-2026 back in the game to significantly boost global football development.

“Without FIFA's financial support, more than 50 per cent of FIFA's member associations could not operate.”

FIFA's average price for the three opening matches of the tournament for hosts Mexico, Canada and the United States across Categories 1, 2 and 3 was $1,728. Prices vary for the other 39 teams. For example, the average price across Category 1-3 prices released by FIFA earlier this month for games involving Germany in the group stage was $422.

Category 3 tickets for the semi-finals exceed $900, with the most expensive seats costing $3,295.

Tickets for the final on July 19 at MetLife Stadium have been on sale for as much as $8,680 since the draw at the start of this month, nearly $2,000 more than the original price in October.

“We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,” Infantino added on Monday.” So, 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.

“In the almost 100 years of the World Cup, FIFA has sold 44 million tickets in total. So, in two weeks, we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. Imagine that. This is absolutely crazy.”

A press release from FIFA later on Monday repeated Infatino's claim, stating that “over 150 million ticket requests have been submitted to date by fans from over 200 countries.”

The “random selection draw” ticketing phase that opened on December 11 will conclude January 13. Fans have been applying for tickets in specific categories to specific matches for the aforementioned prices. FIFA then randomly selects an unknown number of applicants, charges them the listed price before they are given their requested tickets at some point on or after February 5.

Any remaining tickets will be sold on a “first-come-first-served” basis.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has defended the exorbitant cost of World Cup tickets, described by fan groups as 'scandalous'. 

Tickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup.

The cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from supporters. 

'We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,' argued Infantino at the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday.

'So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.

'In the almost 100 years of the World Cup, FIFA has sold 44 million tickets in total. So, in two weeks we could have filled 300 years of World Cups. Imagine that. This is absolutely crazy.'

He also said that the profits would be pumped back into football, adding: 'What's crucial is that the revenues that are generated from this are going back to the game all over the world.

'Without FIFA there would be no football in 150 countries in the world. There is football because, and thanks to, these revenues we generate with, and from, the World Cup which we reinvest all over the world.'

After the enormous backlash from fans at the pricing, FIFA did guarantee a small selection of tickets would be available at a reduced cost of £45, thought to be around 10 per cent of the overall allocation handed to each nation taking part.

In England's case, the tickets – which will be available for all games - will go to members of the official supporters' club. 

While the figure is relatively small, the move represents a significant victory for campaigners and fans. 

A FIFA spokesperson said: 'Fans of the national teams that have qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2026 will benefit from a dedicated ticket pricing tier, which has been designed to make following their teams on football's greatest stage more affordable. 

'The newly introduced Supporter Entry Tier will be available at the fixed price of USD 60 per ticket for each of the 104 matches, including the final.' 

England have been handed an allocation of eight per cent of capacity at each game. That means for the opener against Croatia in Dallas, they will be given 4,000 in total with 400 available at £45. 

However, there are more than 600 ‘top cappers', the highest tier in the group, so FA bosses will have to decide how to distribute them. A ballot is thought to be most likely. 

The Football Supporters' Association previous branded the initial price categorisation ‘laughable' and 'scandalous'. ‘Loyalty has been thrown out of the window and supporters of the participating nations have been completely let down', they added.

Football Supporters' Europe went further, saying they were ‘astonished by the extortionate ticket prices imposed by FIFA on the most dedicated supporters for next year's FIFA World Cup'.

A spokesperson added: 'This is a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

This interest represents “3.4 times more than the overall number of spectators who have attended the 964 matches that make up all 22 editions of the competition combined since 1930.”

For those still looking to get their hands on tickets, the current Random Selection Draw phase lasts through Jan. 11, 2026. Fans have an equal chance at receiving tickets through this draw, but will be able to buy tickets in future draws if they are unsuccessful. 

Ticket prices are divided into tiers, including the new Supporter Entry Tier that offers $60 tickets at each match. It was created in response to backlash over unaffordable ticket prices.

“The FIFA World Cup 2026 is set to be the greatest and most inclusive show on the planet, with more than 150 million tickets already requested in only the first 15 days, making this edition 30 times oversubscribed - a true showcase of incredible demand from fans from over 200 countries,” said Infantino.

Barcelona are eyeing a move for Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic on a free transfer as the Catalan giants see the striker as a potential replacement for Robert Lewandowski. The veteran Polish forward, who will soon enter the final six months of his current contract, has yet to decide on his future at Barcelona and has not penned a fresh extension yet.

Lewandowski, whose contract is nearing its expiry, has acknowledged that no clear decision has yet been made over whether his journey in Catalonia will continue beyond the 2025-26 campaign after overcoming a few injury issues this year. 

While speaking to Polish journalist Bogdan Rymanowski earlier this month, Lewandowski offered a candid assessment of his situation, revealing both reflection and restraint. He said: ""I still have time to make a decision. Right now, I don't know where I want to play. There's no need to think about it yet. I don't know which direction to take, but I don't have any pressure."" 

Lewandowski stressed that discussions with Barcelona's hierarchy remain distant rather than tense, and that financial considerations are not the defining factor. ""I am not talking to the coach about interested clubs,"" he added. ""It's not about cutting my salary in half. A lot depends on the club's plan and what I want.""

As Lewandowski's future remains uncertain, Barcelona have begun their search for the Polish forward's replacement. According to Marca, the Catalan giants have reportedly identified Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic as a like-for-like replacement of Lewandowski. Vlahovic's current contract in Turin is valid until the end of the 2025-26 campaign, after which he will become a free agent.

While Hansi Flick considers Ferran Torres to be a perfect option to replace Lewandowski in his starting lineup, the club would also want someone to bolster the attack and fill the hole left by Lewandowski's departure next summer. 

Vlahovic has struggled with form and fitness issues in the current season, as he has scored just three goals in the Serie A and in the Champions League. He also suffered an abductor injury only a month back and won't return to action at least until the first match of 2026.

Chelsea loanee Nicolas Jackson might leave Bayern Munich next summer once his loan deal expires, as the Bavarian giants are unlikely to make his move permanent. With Jackson's future uncertain, the German champions have begun to look elsewhere and Fabrizio Romano claimed that Bayern held talks in October with representatives of Juventus striker Vlahovic. The 25-year-old Serbian forward is considered a strong candidate and will likely be a more affordable option, particularly given his contract is set to expire next summer.

Amid an uncertain future at Camp Nou, interest in Lewandowski is intensifying across the world. According to Spanish outlet AS, his agent Pini Zahavi is set to hold fresh talks with officials from the Saudi Pro League ahead of the January transfer window. The report claims an offer has already been placed on the table, though the identities of the clubs involved remain undisclosed. The attraction of the Middle East is obvious. The Saudi Pro League has already lured some of the sport's most recognisable names, including Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad's Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante.

For Lewandowski, the prospect of a final chapter in a rapidly expanding league, accompanied by significant financial reward, is understood to be appealing. Saudi Arabia is not the only destination under consideration. 

Earlier this month, the BBC reported that Lewandowski's representatives had also held discussions with Chicago Fire over a possible move to Major League Soccer. Chicago Fire have made no secret of their desire to sign a global star and are believed to have identified Lewandowski as a priority target for several months.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Florian Wirtz has been placed on a ‘special bulk programme' as Liverpool's summer signing continues to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League. After enduring a tough start to his journey in England following his £116million ($156.5m) summer arrival, the Germany international finally opened his account in the Premier League last weekend as he scored the winning goal against Wolves.

The German attacking midfielder had an underwhelming start to his journey in the Premier League after Liverpool broke the bank to sign Wirtz for a then-British record transfer fee from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer transfer window. The 22-year-old went 16 English top-flight matches without scoring a goal before finally ending his drought last Saturday, as he scored the all-important second goal for the Reds after Ryan Gravenberch handed the English champions the lead. The German's strike proved crucial for the club as Wolves pulled one back at the start of the second half.

After his initial struggles in Merseyside, the Liverpool coaching staff placed Wirtz on a special programme to bulk up in order to match the intensity of the Premier League, according to the Daily Mail. The hard shifts in the gym and intense weight training have clearly paid off as Wirtz has gained two kilograms in weight and was seen at the very best of his abilities against Wolves at Anfield last weekend.

The midfielder had a commanding presence in the attacking third as he controlled the game and even contributed with a late first-half goal. Liverpool fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief that Wirtz has found his old form from Germany and is now ready to light up the Premier League.

After Wirtz's heroics at Anfield, Reds boss Arne Slot had told Sky Sports: ""The team have seen how much he (Wirtz) did already for us, creating chances and being so close to a goal. He will go on and score many more goals than one for us. I think Florian did more than only score today.""

Wirtz then himself told Sky Sports: ""It was very nice the feeling on the pitch with the fans around. I was very happy and I still am. I was confident that I would score one day. I wanted to start earlier scoring and assisting but it was like this and I have to accept it. I just know that it will come and I try to keep going like that. We played a brilliant first half. We lost the game and got it back. Everyone was working hard. In the last 20 minutes, we made it a bit difficult. I cannot explain why. We have to change that. That's how we want to do it. We want to be there and be on top of the table. It's not been an easy start for us but we're doing better and getting the points.""

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk also showered the youngster with praise as he said: ""I was very happy for him. He played a very good game. Everyone was outstanding in the first half. It's great to see and hopefully many more to come from him. He's getting used to playing for Liverpool and what we want to do as a team. He's getting used to the intensity. After about 70 minutes I think he had some cramp. It's part of the game. He just has to keep going. It was an important goal for us and now on to New Year's Day. I think he runs almost everywhere. At times on the left, at times in the middle. He's a very intelligent player who is so comfortable on the ball. He finds space between the lines and can be very important. ""He wants to be important in terms of goals and assists. The work rate he puts in and the chances he creates is what I think is even more important. I am really pleased for him, like the rest of the team. You saw the celebrations. Everyone is so happy for him.""

Wirtz will now aim to push forward in 2026 and play a decisive role reminiscent of his price tag in Liverpool's push for silverware come the end of the season. His Anfield career is still in its infancy and there will be many more opportunities for the playmaker to affect games in the Premier League and show just why he was one of the most sought-after players in world football over the summer.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

NY & Broadway Editor


Peyton List, whose TV credits include the Paramount+  series School Spirits and Netflix's Cobra Kai, will take to the stage later this month when she joins the hit Off Broadway revival of Heathers The Musical.


	Beginning Monday, January 26, List will take over the role of Heather Chandler, currently being played by Jodie Steele. List joins a cast that includes Casey Likes, Kuhoo Verma, Jackera Davis,  Elizabeth Teete, Kerry Butler, among others.


	Since beginning previews at New World Stages on June 22 and officially opening July 10, Heathers, directed by Andy Fickman, has broken the house record four times as well as building the largest advance in the venue's 21-year history. The production recently extended its run for the second time and is playing through May 24, 2026.

	“I'm drawn to characters who are powerful, complicated, and a little dangerous,” said List in a statement. “Heather Chandler is an icon for a reason – she's larger than life, hilarious, terrifying, and deeply symbolic. Stepping into this role is thrilling, and I can't wait to enter my bad girl era. It'll be so very.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	List stars as Maddie Nears in Paramount+'s School Spirits, and serves as Executive Producer. The series returns for its third season this month. On Netflix's Cobra Kai, which ended its sixth and final season as one of Netflix's most popular series earlier this year, List played Tory Nichols.


	Previously, List played Emma Ross on Disney Channel's Jessie before reprising the character in the spinoff series Bunk'd. Other television credits include Hulu's supernatural thriller Light as a Feather, the dystopian feature The Thinning, and CBS' Happy Together. Film credits include the Netflix romantic drama Girl Haunts Boy, the supernatural thriller The Inheritance opposite Bob Gunton, and the sci-fi drama Anthem of a Teenage Prophet. 

	











Heathers features book, music and lyrics by Kevin Murphy (Reefer Madness The Musical) & Laurence O'Keefe (Legally Blonde The Musical, Bat Boy The Musical), based on the 1989 film by Daniel Waters. 


	The cult film starred Winona Ryder and Christian Slater (and Kim Walker in the Heather Chandler role), Heathers originally opened in Los Angeles for a sold-out run in 2013 and originally transferred to Off Broadway's New World Stages in 2014. Heathers has had three West End productions and three tours, which have broken box office records throughout the UK and Ireland. 


	The synopsis: Welcome to Westerberg High, where popularity is a matter of life and death, and Veronica Sawyer is just another nobody dreaming of a better day. But when she's unexpectedly taken under the wings of The Heathers – three beautiful and impossibly cruel classmates all named Heather – her dreams of popularity finally start to come true. That is until J.D., the mysterious teen rebel, turns up and teaches her that it might kill to be a nobody, but it's murder being a somebody.

Lisa Rinna had a long run on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” but it could have been even longer. The former RHOBH cast member revealed in a recent interview that she auditioned for the first season of the Bravo reality show in 2010, but that Andy Cohen stopped her from being hired.

“I was up for Housewives season one,” Rinna, 62, revealed on the “Skinny Confidential Him & Her Show.” “I went in for casting. I got pretty far. And  Andy said, ‘I don't want any actresses on the show.' So he wouldn't — [he] didn't hire me.”

“Season five, when I came in, he decided to let actresses come, and they hired me and Eileen Davidson,” the former “Days of Our Lives” star continued. “So it did change the game because we came in as soap actors, like together.”

Rinna added that she “only” had fun with Davidson, who appeared on three seasons of the show. “Because it was not fun. None of it is fun,” she added.

Rinna was a cast member on RHOBH from Season 5 through Season 12.  She announced her exit from the show in January 2023. Cohen, who serves as an executive producer on Bravo's “Real Housewives” franchise, said Rinna had “an iconic run” on RHOBH, according to People magazine.

Even though the first seasons of RHOBH featured sibling actresses Kim and Kyle Richards, Cohen admitted he was against the idea of having actresses on the cast.

“I actually have mixed feelings about having stars on the show,” Cohen told The Hollywood Reporter in a May 2024 interview. “When Lisa Rinna was trying out for Season 1 of ‘Beverly Hills,' I was very much against the idea. Like, she's already a celebrity! But then she came, and it made perfect sense.”

After  Rinna announced her departure from RHOBH, Cohen addressed the news on his SiriusXM show, “Andy Cohen Live.”

“First, you've gotta give props to Lisa Rinna for being, by the way, eight years,” said Cohen. “I mean, she's a working actor. She's been an actor. Usually, you don't get a part on a show that goes for eight years. So this is a reality show, and that is a testament to how compelling Lisa Rinna is to watch on television that she went eight years.”

‘[She] has been really a huge part of ‘Beverly Hills,'” he added. “I really do hope that this is a pause. I hope she will come back. I really do . …I just hope that Lisa will humor us and comes back. …I  do hope that this is a pause, because I always enjoyed Lisa Rinna on my TV.”

Despite being behind some of RHOBH's messiest scenes, Rinna has been very adamant that her days as a Bravo star are done.

In a 2024 interview on “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” Rinna said she would “never” return to the “Real Housewives” after leaving on her own terms.

“No. Never. No, I wouldn't,” she told Hudson. “I am grateful for that show. I am the person I am today because of it, but I'll never go back.”

“One Battle After Another” is a film littered with great moments, from the captivating prologue that Teyana Taylor dominates to the poignant “American Girl” needle drop that closes the epic out. But there's one sequence the film that critics and audiences have singled out as a standout: the stomach-churning, incredibly suspenseful road chase along a winding desert highway path that serves as the film's tense climax. 

“The road, man,” Luke Lynch, editor of “BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions,” told “One Battle” editor Andy Jurgensen during IndieWire's Editors craft roundtables. “I mean, it's just a road, but it's playing with lenses and movement and timing and the suspense that you're building.”

Jurgensen and Lynch spoke about their respective films at IndieWire's Editing Craft Roundtable, hosted by IndieWire features writer Jim Hemphill. Also in attendance were the editors behind “Hamnet,” “Dead Man's Wire,” “A House of Dynamite,” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” who spoke about the challenges and accomplishments of assembling their films.

 










Speaking on his work behind the car chase sequence, Jurgensen said that the sequence was difficult to cut down. To get it to the right length, he relied a lot on the sound department's input to figure out the right rhythm for the shots.

“You know, there's a lot of footage, we shot from all the different perspectives,” Jurgensen said during the roundtable. “I made selects, was just choosing the best things. It was really long for the longest time. Sending it to the sound department early helped a lot, because we could kind of give each of the cars their own sound, as their own character. So even though it was really long, then I could just take that really long sequence and chop it up and still use their stems to kind of still have that same feeling, the layering on that sort of orchestra sound going  up and down over some of the different hill sounds. So it was just fine-tuning till the very last day of the mix.”

      NASA Physicist Dr. Yu Explains Why UFOs Spin, and Why There Is Always Light..
    


      Most of you were probably aware of this already, but I like the way Dr. Yu explains to Clayton why UFOs spin.
    


https://x.com/UAPWatchers/status/2005666985078583774



      EVERYTHING We know about the Universe is Wrong, NASA physicist just exposed it all
    


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_SHGYOJhGU







      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are diverse and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed cases, along with the perspectives of various Redditors:
    


      Many Redditors find the statements from high-ranking officials and credible individuals particularly compelling:
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""It is time for the truth to be brought out. Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      Personal accounts, especially when detailed and potentially corroborated, are often considered convincing:
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: A Redditor describes seeing a silent, rectangular craft with curved corners and three large, dim, almost organic lights. ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



      Another Redditor shared a similar experience: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



      When multiple sightings match in description, it can add credibility:
    


Portugal and San Diego Sightings: A Redditor highlights the striking similarity between a UFO sighting in Portugal from the 90s and a video from San Diego in 2015. ""The ufo that the San Diego man recorded, matches exactly like the one reported in the Portugal sighting...""



      Another Redditor notes: ""There's definitely credibility with consistency in sightings, provided that these are two separate instances""



      While rare, official reports can offer a more objective perspective:
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: The Condon Committee report suggested a mechanical device of unknown origin. ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting.""



      It's important to consider skeptical explanations, which are also prevalent on Reddit:
    


Factual Errors in Official Accounts: One Redditor points out factual inaccuracies in the list of credible people, which can undermine the overall credibility. [""

The duo, both 31, met in 2018 and became inseparable while working at GuavaPass, a fitness app. Yiong was laid off when Guavapass was acquired by ClassPass in 2019.

Two years later, during the pandemic, Chng was laid off from her marketing job. The duo reunited to launch an athleisure brand, then called Butter, despite having no experience in fashion or entrepreneurship.

Chng's retrenchment and the pandemic lockdown gave them the push they needed to start the brand.

""At that point, we had nothing to lose,"" Yiong said.

They started with online sales, and in October this year, they opened their first retail store in Singapore's upscale ION Orchard mall, in the heart of the city's luxury shopping district.

Building a brand during the pandemic in an already saturated market and for a conservative audience was not easy.

Exercise and sports have always been a big part of the founders' lives.

Yiong was an F45 trainer, has practiced yoga, pilates, and Muay Thai, and is now training for her first Hyrox. Chng was part of a national team representing Singapore at the 2011 Touch Rugby World Cup and has also dabbled in cheerleading, pilates, yoga, and HIIT.

When Chng was laid off from ClassPass in 2020, they decided to go all in on an athleisure clothing line, which started off with the name ""Butter."" They invested 20,000 Singapore dollars in 2020 into the brand.

Half came from Yiong's savings, and the other half came from Chng's severance pay.

They started product design in March 2020 and found suppliers in China. They launched in October that year with just two products in two colors: a longline sports bra and a pair of leggings.

COVID lockdowns that pushed everyone online helped them gain visibility. About 500 people joined an online workout they hosted in March 2021.

In 2022, they sold the brand to Love, Bonito, a Singaporean women's wear brand. Afterward, they changed the brand's name to Cheak.

Launching an athleisure brand in Singapore came with a unique set of challenges.

Women in Singapore and Southeast Asia place a high value on modesty and require padding in the bust, the duo said.

""A lot of overseas brands don't have padding. In Singapore, you need padding; it's non-negotiable. One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, 'Does it have padding?'"" Chng said.

""But padding changes the construction completely for the product — it requires so many more stitches, and it makes it difficult to have a very clean bind,"" she added.

Another issue was the sheerness of the fabric.

""Overseas brands don't double line their lighter colors because I think the women are a bit more comfortable with a slight sheerness, but in Singapore, that's not acceptable,"" she said.

""But when you double-line a garment, it becomes very thick. So, we spent about a year changing the fabric and reducing its thickness so that when we double-lined it, it would still be comfortable,"" Chng added.

Designing clothes for a customer base that likes to play it safe requires a good deal of restraint, the founders said. They said there was plenty they wanted to experiment with, but had to tone down.

""A lot of brands that are quite popular internationally are quite sexy and crazy nowadays,"" Yiong said. ""So we take that idea, and tweak it to what will work for our audience.""

Singapore is becoming a competitive space for athleisure brands. Alo Yoga, the athleisure brand worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber, opened its first store in the city's Marina Bay Sands mall in September.

In ION Orchard, the mall where Cheak is located, shoppers can also find Lululemon, Cotton On Body, and Adidas.

To stand out, Cheak focuses on making clothes for Asian women — and that doesn't just mean making them more petite.

""The bust shape is different, our waists are smaller, our hips are slightly wider, and the femur is also a little bit shorter,"" Yiong said.

Sizing is different for Asian women, too, she added.

""We don't necessarily grow taller as we get bigger; we grow width-wise,"" Yiong said.

She also said that international brands do not suitably cater to the hot and humid climate that Southeast Asia is known for.

""Fresh international brands, let's say Alo, for example, they come in bringing winter season clothes,"" she said. ""There's no winter; we only have one season, so the fabric needs to be cooling.""

Cheak's prices are slightly lower than those of its foreign competitors. One of Cheak's bestselling sports bras costs 55 Singapore dollars, or about $42, while a similar-looking piece from Lululemon costs S$58.

The business has yet to come between the founders.

""Outside of work, we don't talk about work,"" Chng said. ""We see each other on weekends, and our partners hang out together, but we never talk about work.""

On the flipside, at work, they don't talk about other things, helping to distinguish their ""work personality and friend personality.""

Yiong handles the backend work, while Chng handles the creative and customer-facing parts of the work.

But work and life inevitably collide, like when they go on holiday together and fire up their laptops to solve a crisis.

""Our partners see that as their cue to go do their own thing,"" Yiong joked.

Running their business comes with many perks. Chng, who just had a baby, said she loves having a flexible schedule and working in a hybrid setting.

But that doesn't mean it's less stressful than a corporate job.

""I think a lot of people glamorize what being a founder or starting your own business is,"" she said. ""You have to be able to give up everything, your time, your money, your brain power, your emotions into the business because if you don't do it, no one else is going to.""

She added, ""It takes a different kind of resilience to handle it, but at the same time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum's Quiet Bounce Faces A Bigger Test Above $3,550","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:862f0dbf7094b:0-ethereum-s-quiet-bounce-faces-a-bigger-test-above-3-550/","Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:00:02 GMT","

Ethereum's recent rebound has brought a brief sense of relief, but the bigger challenge still lies ahead. While price is attempting to stabilize after weeks of sideways action, the broader structure suggests this move remains corrective rather than decisive. Until ETH can clear the $3,550 barrier, the bounce looks more like a pause in consolidation than the start of a sustained upside breakout.

Sideways Correction Still Dominates Ethereum's Structure

According to More Crypto Online, Ethereum continues to trade within a sideways corrective structure that has been in place since November 21. Price action remains capped below the upper boundary of this corrective trend channel, signaling that the market has yet to show a convincing shift toward a broader bullish phase.

At this stage, a break above the corrective channel is the minimum indication that upside momentum may be developing. Even if Ethereum does push higher, caution is still warranted. Any advance from current levels could simply unfold as a yellow B-wave within a larger circle wave 5, or as an extended phase of circle wave 4. Both scenarios imply that upward movement may be corrective in nature rather than the start of a sustained rally.

For the more bullish orange scenario to gain real credibility, Ethereum would need to reclaim the $3,550 resistance level decisively. A clean break and hold above this zone would help confirm a stronger breakout structure and reduce the risk that the move is merely a temporary bounce.

Until such confirmation appears, the probability of another downside test remains elevated. Overall, the technical structure still favors consolidation or further downside over an immediate bullish continuation, keeping the market in a cautious mode.

ETH Mirrors Bitcoin's Range-Bound Behavior

In a more recent update, Crypto Candy noted that Ethereum continues to mirror Bitcoin's price behavior, remaining locked in a well-defined range between $2,700 and $3,400. ETH's price has been largely stagnant over the past few sessions, indicating indecision across the broader market as participants await a clearer directional cue.

However, ETH recently found support in the $2,600–$2,700 demand zone, where buyers stepped in and sparked a short-term bounce. This reaction has allowed price to start pushing back toward higher levels within the range, suggesting that downside pressure is easing for now. If momentum continues to build, a move toward the upper boundary around $3,400 could regain focus.

For the bullish bias to remain valid, the $2,600–$2,700 support area must continue to hold. A clean breakdown below that zone would weaken the current recovery attempt and reopen the door to deeper downside.

Cameron weighs in on Kathryn Bigelow's nuke thriller and explains why its cliffhanger ending was actually perfect. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


James Cameron made waves when he called Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer a “moral cop-out” for not depicting the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.  


	So what does he think of the ending of Netflix‘s A House of Dynamite, which — spoilers follow — stops just shy of showing potential nuclear destruction in America?




	The riveting thriller's ending divided viewers when it was released in October, with some feeling the film pulled a punch by wrapping on a cliffhanger, leaving the audience unsure if a rogue ICBM destroyed Chicago, and how the film's president (Idris Elba) responded.

A House of Dynamite was directed by Kathryn Bigelow — Cameron's friend, former spouse and frequent collaborator — and the Avatar filmmaker tells The Hollywood Reporter that he had dinner with Bigelow just a few weeks ago and they discussed the ending.


	“I said to her, ‘I utterly defend that ending,'” he says. “It's really the only possible ending. You don't get to the end of [the classic short story] ‘The Lady or the Tiger?‘ and know what's behind which door.”


	Continued Cameron: “But that's not even really the point. The point is: From the moment the scenerio began at minute zero when the missile was launched and detected, the outcome already sucked. There was no good outcome, and the movie spent two hours showing you there is no good outcome. We cannot countenance these weapons existing at all. And it all boils down to one guy in the American system, the president, who is the only person allowed to launch a nuclear strike, either offensively or defensively, and the lives of every person on the planet revolve around that one person. That's the world we live in and we need to remember that when we vote next time.” 

	











	Concluded the filmmaker: “So the end of that movie was the only way that movie could have ended because — as the computer says at the end of War Games — ‘the only way to win is not to play.'” 


	Cameron has used his work to warn about the threat of nuclear war going back to his 1984 feature debut, The Terminator. His films Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Abyss and True Lies also revolved around nuclear threats. 


	The director has obtained the rights to the Charles Pellegrino's book Ghosts of Hiroshima, which chronicles the true story of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who in 1945 survived the nuclear blasts at both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron promised Yamaguchi on his deathbed in 2010 that he'd make the film.


	On the subject of Oppenheimer, Cameron previously told Deadline, “it's interesting what he stayed away from. Look, I love the filmmaking, but I did feel that it was a bit of a moral cop out. Because it's not like Oppenheimer didn't know the effects [of the bomb]. He's got one brief scene in the film where we see — and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film – but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him. But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don't know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn't want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. I'm just stupid that way.”

Frankie Muniz gets lured back into the sticky web of his wackadoo family in the first teaser for the Malcolm in the Middle: Life Still Unfair reboot.


	The 40-second clip opens with a grown-up Malcolm asserting proudly, “My life is fantastic now! All I had to do is stay away from my family.” But that carefully erected barrier crumbles when his parents, Hal (Bryan Cranston) and Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), insist their middle child attend their 40th wedding anniversary party.


	The new teaser doesn't give much away in terms of plot, though it is filled with plenty of hijinks: a pink-clad army toting confetti cannons, Malcolm hiding from Lois in a bathroom stall, and Hal bashing some poor guy over the head with what looks like a typewriter. There's also a glimpse at one of the reboot's new dynamics, between Malcolm and his own teenage daughter (Keeley Karson), who encourages her dad to reunite with his family.

	Along with Muniz, Cranston, and Kaczmarek, Malcolm in the Middle: Life Is Unfair will feature Chris Kennedy Masterson and Justin Berfield reprising their roles as Malcolm's brothers Francis and Reese, and Amy Coligado as Francis' wife, Piama. The only member of the original cast not returning is Erik Par Sullivan, who played Hal and Lois' youngest son, Dewey, in the original series; Caleb Ellsworth-Clark will take over the role in the reboot. (Sullivan is reportedly working on a master's degree in Victorian literature.) As for new cast members, Karson and Ellsworth-Clark will be joined by Vaughan Murrae and Kiana Madeira.
