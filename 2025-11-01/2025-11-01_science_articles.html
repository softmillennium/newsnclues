                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The genetic link between bones discovered thousands of miles away from each other suggests a prehistoric migration route. Archaeologists who recently excavated the site sifted through animal bones, eventually finding a fragment that belonged to a Neanderthal who lived 40-50,000 years ago. What they didn't know was that this individual's relatives had been found as far as the eastern extremes of Siberia. Until now, they had all turned out to be medieval or post-medieval. While remains of Neanderthals on the verge of extinction have been found in the region, which appeared to be a refuge for these hominins, DNA could not be extracted from them. Now, ancient DNA from the Neanderthal bone fragment known as Star 1 is revealing how they migrated. Late Neanderthal and early modern human remains are rarely unearthed in Eurasia. This minimally destructive technique separated the Neanderthal bone fragment, most likely a humerus or femur, from the bones of ancient fauna. “Genetically, Star 1 is closely related to Neanderthals from the Altai via its mitochondrial DNA, suggesting long-range migrations of Neanderthal groups across Eurasia,” Pigott said in a study recently published in PNAS. Whoever this individual was, radiocarbon dating of Star 1 revealed that they lived during the Crimean Micoquian technological period, during which stone was hammered thin and retouched on both sides to produce bifacial tools and weapons. This bone fragment was linked to others from three sites in the Altai mountains of Siberia. Pigott and her team investigated further by building habitat suitability models that suggested the paleoclimate during interglacial periods, when vast ice sheets that had frozen over during ice ages melted, was most favorable for traveling. Chagyrskaya and Okladnikov are thought to have been seasonal hunting camps. Faunal bones that date to around the same time period, some of which still have knife marks, show that they hunted horses, bison and other animals that roamed the steppes where they lived. Stone tools excavated from Starosele also bear a remarkable likeness to those in Okladnikov and Chagyrskaya. “It is likely that Neanderthals were in the Altai at two, perhaps even three, different periods,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disrupting communication between the body's internal clock and the brain could help limit neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, according to new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WashU Medicine). Led by Erik Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte & Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, and first author Jiyeon Lee, PhD, the research team investigated whether blocking a specific circadian clock protein might slow the progression of neurodegeneration. They found that inhibiting the activity of this protein lowered levels of tau, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer's pathology, and reduced damage to brain tissue. While its role in the brain has been less understood, earlier studies in other tissues showed that REV-ERBα influences levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a molecule vital for metabolism, energy production, and DNA repair. Declining NAD+ levels are closely associated with brain aging and neurodegenerative conditions. In a further experiment, the researchers blocked REV-ERBα using both genetic methods and a new drug that has also shown promise in studies of amyloid-β and Parkinson's disease. This approach increased NAD+ levels and shielded the mice from tau-related brain damage. Tau aggregates are known to disrupt brain function and drive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How Childhood Relationships Affect Your Adult Attachment Style, according to Large New Study A large new study reveals how early relationships with parents and friends influence how we relate to those closest to us in adulthood We come into the world screaming and vulnerable—entirely dependent on adult caregivers to keep us safe and teach us how to connect with others. The nature of these earliest relationships influences how we behave towards others and see the world long after we've grown—but in more complex and nuanced ways than researchers previously thought, according to the results of a large, decades-long study examining how the quality of children's interactions with parents and close peers went on to influence their relationships in adulthood. In particular, early dynamics with mothers predicted future attachment styles for all the primary relationships in participants' lives, including with their parents, best friends and romantic partners, the study found. “People who felt closer to their mothers and had less conflict with their mothers in childhood tended to feel more secure in all of their relationships in adulthood,” says Keely Dugan, an assistant professor of social personality psychology at the University of Missouri and lead author of the study, which was published in October in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “That's a really striking finding because it demonstrates the enduring impact of that first person who is supposed to be there for you.” If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. The idea that earliest relationships have an outsized impact on our lives was popularized in psychology by Sigmund Freud. British psychiatrist John Bowlby later incorporated some core Freudian elements to create attachment theory, which helps explain variations in how people approach close relationships. “Some people are quite comfortable depending on others, opening up to them and using them as a secure base, whereas other people lack that confidence and trust,” says the new study's co-author R. Chris Fraley, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. People high in attachment anxiety might have more intense fears of abandonment or need for reassurance. The second factor, attachment avoidance, involves how comfortable you feel opening up to others and depending on them for support. Those high in avoidance may believe that people cannot be counted on or trusted, so they avoid asking for help or emotional support—even if they need it. A relationship with high attachment anxiety, avoidance or both is defined as more insecure, while a relationship that is low in both attachment anxiety and avoidance is considered to be secure: “You feel comfortable and close to the other person, you trust them to be there for you, and you feel supported,” Dugan says. It can be difficult to study exactly how early relationships go on to influence attachment style, though, because people's retrospective reports of what happened to them in childhood are skewed by memory failings and emotional and cognitive biases, Dugan notes. Of the relatively few studies that have examined associations between early caregiving experiences and adult attachment styles, she adds, all have focused almost exclusively on a single early relationship: the maternal one. To more deeply understand how early relationships with a wider variety of people impact attachment styles, Dugan, Fraley and their colleagues turned to a landmark longitudinal study of 1,364 children and their families from around the U.S. Once the young participants were old enough to speak, they were surveyed about the quality of their relationships with their fathers, mothers and best friends. For instance, people who had more conflict with their mothers, were less close to their mothers or had mothers who were reportedly harsher and showed less warmth during childhood and adolescence tended to feel more insecure in their adult relationships. “This cohort's first assessment was in 1991, and even though the burden of caregiving still heavily falls on mothers, fathers were even less involved back then, on average,” Dugan says. Early experiences with close friends, though, were an even stronger predicter than maternal relationships for determining participants' approach to—specifically—romantic relationships and friendships in adulthood. People who enjoyed increasingly close and deepening friendships across childhood and adolescence also showed significant gains in those departments as adults, she adds. The study's decades-spanning data are “uniquely valuable” and allowed the authors “to show, using sophisticated analyses, how early social experiences affect later adult personality and close interpersonal relationships,” says Phillip Shaver, a distinguished professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis. Omri Gillath, a social psychologist at the University of Kansas, describes the new study as “exceptionally rigorous and methodologically sound.” The authors “provide some of the strongest prospective evidence to date supporting a foundational assumption of attachment theory: that early relational experiences shape how adults relate to others”—not just in general but also within specific types of relationships, he says. The participants were still in early adulthood in the most recent analysis, Gillath adds, so future work could examine whether the same early-life factors continue to be so influential throughout life—and how major life transitions, such as parenthood, bereavement or divorce, might reshape those dynamics. Single-parent families, multigenerational households and same-sex couples should also be studied in future research, Dugan says. Participants in the current study were nearly 80 percent white, so more racial and ethnic diversity is needed to get a truly representative sample, she adds. To that end, Dugan and her colleagues are building a research-based interactive app for promoting secure attachments in both romantic relationships and adult friendships. “It starts with easy first tasks, like hugging a partner or sending an encouraging text to a friend, and then works up from there,” she says. “There's always an opportunity to change your attachment style, and I'm excited about finding the most effective practical, concrete strategies for doing that.” Her latest book is I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World (Bloomsbury, 2023).
