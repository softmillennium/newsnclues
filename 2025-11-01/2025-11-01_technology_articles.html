                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Generative AI has made its way onto the professional soccer field. Laura Harvey, head coach of Seattle Reign FC, said this week that ChatGPT helped her come up with a new defensive strategy. Speaking on the Soccerish Podcast, Harvey said she was curious if ChatGPT could answer questions about soccer. So she started prompting OpenAI's chatbot with questions about her team. But then she asked: “What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?” It then listed every team in the women's soccer professional league, with a suggested formation. Harvey said she wasn't super familiar with the strategy and had not used it as a coach. “But it was like, ‘This is what we would say to do.' And that was what spurred me to look into it. OpenAI's own research this year found that people increasingly rely on ChatGPT “as an advisor rather than only for task completion.” “ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making,” according to the research. University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Call up your energy provider, get connected to their distributed generation department, and submit the forms/documentation/plans they require. I can upload my forms and the process to GitHub if anyone wants to see the process for NY state.The simplest grid-tied system is solar panels + roof-mounting equipment + microinverters + a combiner box + a disconnect switch. This is enough to send solar power direct to the grid, assuming your microinverter supports the standards your power utility requires. It should be cheaper to do grid-tied projects, but many power utilities now mandate new standards for grid-tied devices that only the expensive inverters support.If you do off-grid (which I believe there's still some tax breaks for, depending), you can build a PV+ESS system much cheaper, as the off-grid equipment doesn't require the more expensive standards. A big concern of mine is that poor people and people in apartments (~40% of Americans live in apartments) won't have the ability to supplement their bills with solar.

Regulators are powerless to actually help despite months of letters.- You have a 25 year warranty on parts and labor, but a tree/hail falls on the house and they declare it out of bounds of warranty. You buy a whole new system, only partially covered and start all over again.- You have a 25 year warranty on parts and labor, but manufacturer blames the malfunction on improper installation, but the installation company is long-gone/retired/non-responsive/bankrupt. Possibly the Accord insurance form is fake also (how many people actually verify the insurance Accord is real? )Been there, done that, on all the above.

But this is a warranty, and you have many panels. Of course you need to replace it with an identical panel, so it makes more sense to buy extra panels and just assume some will die. But even if you paid for a replacement, that's already just $100-$200, and it'll probably be cheaper in the future.So the warranty isn't really that important long-term. They're more important for the short term, and a Tier 1 solar provider's so reliable that you don't really need it anyway. So the warranty isn't really that important long-term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>> Before being considered for submission to arXiv's CS category, review articles and position papers must now be accepted at a journal or a conference and complete successful peer review.Edit: original title was "arXiv No Longer Accepts Computer Science Position or Review Papers Due to LLMs" Edit: original title was "arXiv No Longer Accepts Computer Science Position or Review Papers Due to LLMs" If you take a look at arXiv's policies for specific content types you'll notice that review articles and position papers are not (and have never been) listed as part of the accepted content types. ArXiv CS requires peer review for surveys amid flood of AI-written ones- nothing happened to preprints- "summarization" articles always required it, they are just pointing at it out loud "In the past few years, arXiv has been flooded with papers. Generative AI / large language models have added to this flood by making papers – especially papers not introducing new research results – fast and easy to write. "Fast forward to present day – submissions to arXiv in general have risen dramatically, and we now receive hundreds of review articles every month. "Surely a lot of them are also about LLMs: LLMs are the hot computing topic and where all the money and attention is, and they're also used heavily in the field. So that could at least partially account for why this policy is for CS papers only, but the announcement's rationale is about LLMs as producing the papers, not as their subject.

Fundamentally, we want research that offers something new (“what did we learn?”) and presents it in a way that at least plausibly has a chance of becoming generalizable knowledge.

Authors don't oppose changes but you have a lobby of the parasitic publishing cartel that will oppose these changes. Her suggestion was simple: Kick out all non-ivy league and most international researchers. Asking for a small amount of money would probably help. Issue with requiring peer reviewed journals or conferences is the severe lag, takes a long time and part of the advantage of arxiv was that you could have the paper instantly as a preprint. Also these conferences and journals are also receiving enormous quantities of submissions (29.000 for AAAI) so we are just pushing the problem. If arxiv used an open model for review, it would be trivial for people to insert a few grammatical mistakes which cause them to receive max points. Classifying novel vs junk is a much harder problem.

It is a bit different in other fields where interpretations or know-how might be communicated in a review paper format that is otherwise not possible. For example, in biology relating to a new phenomena or function. 1) new grad students to end up with something nice to publish after reviewing the literature or,2) older professors to write a big overview of everything that happened in their field as sort of a “bible” that can get you up to speedThe former is useful as a social construct; I mean, hey, new grad students, don't skimp on your literature review.

My brain doesn't work that way, because I don't like assigning custom rules for special cases (edit: because I usually view that as a form of discrimination). So sometimes I have a blind spot around the realities of a problem that someone is facing, that don't have much to do with its idealization.What I mean is, I don't know that it's up to arXiv to determine what a "review article and position paper" is. Because of that, they must let all papers through, or have all papers face the same review standards.When I see someone getting their fingers into something, like muddying/dithering concepts, shifting focus to something other than the crux of an argument (or using bad faith arguments, etc), I view it as corruption.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Beijing has just allowed companies to apply for exemptions from its Nexperia export ban, allowing those relying on its chips to resume orders finally. With the average modern car containing about 1,500 chips, supply chain instability can stall production and cause assembly lines halfway across the world to cease operation. “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,” a MOFCOM representative said in a statement, meaning Beijing isn't lifting the blanket ban on Nexperia China's exports. This statement comes soon after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on the sidelines of the 2025 APEC Summit. Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's parent company since 2019, was included in the list late last year, meaning Nexperia is in danger of losing access to U.S.-made components, software, and technologies. Washington introduced this rule in late September, which came into effect immediately. However, companies were granted a Temporary General License, effective for 60 days after the expansion of the ban, to allow them to adjust their supply chains. China's move would allow companies to resume deliveries of Nexperia chips if they can obtain a license from Beijing. However, it looks like the company's ownership saga will not end here, as the Dutch head office has ceased exports to its China factory. This adds a further complication to the ongoing spat, because even though Nexperia China can now continue deliveries to its clients who acquire a permit from the MOFCOM, it wouldn't be able to keep up with demand unless its European headquarters resume shipments of the raw materials needed to continue production.

NFTs are just code-designated image files that—for whatever reason—are worth millions of dollars. The influencer lifestyle lets people use social media to monetize their daily activities via highly curated posts. Bloomberg reports on this terrible/bizzare/hilarious new phenomenon, which it describes as “part of a niche category [of prediction market]” where the “outcome isn't tied to earnings, price moves or sports games, but to what people say in some public forum.” Bloomberg notes a recent example of this involving Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's CEO. During the company's recent earnings call, Armstrong finished up by uttering a select number of DeFi terms: “I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call,” Armstrong said at the end of the call. Bloomberg notes that, across various prediction market platforms, approximately $84,000 was bet on whether certain words like “stablecoin,” “margin,” and “institution,” would be spoken during the call.

The Intel Core i9-14900K might be a generation old at this point, but surprisingly, it is still the fastest gaming CPU that Intel currently has to offer. With that title in its possession, the Core i9-14900K is definitely the CPU that Intel would want to pit against AMD's cache-laden Zen 5 processors. While it may not make much sense to put one of AMD's latest flagships against the dated Core i9-14900K at first glance, this is certainly the comparison that gives Intel its best shot at dethroning AMD in this market segment. We will put the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D vs Intel Core i9-14900K CPUs through a rigorous six-round gauntlet to determine which CPU is truly the best in its class, and which one you should spend your money on. The architectural differences between these processors are immediately apparent in their core layouts and thread configurations. In contrast, the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D features a more traditional homogeneous design with 12 cores and 24 threads, all built on the advanced Zen 5 architecture. Operating at a higher base frequency of 4.4 GHz with boost capabilities reaching 5.5 GHz, the 9900X3D emphasizes consistent per-core performance rather than Intel's heterogeneous approach. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Perhaps the most distinctive specification difference lies in the cache architectures, where AMD's 3D V-Cache technology creates a substantial advantage in cache capacity. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D incorporates AMD's second-generation 3D V-Cache technology, providing a massive 128 MB of L3 cache through vertical stacking of cache dies. While respectable, this pales in comparison to AMD's cache implementation. The Intel Core i9-14900K supports both DDR5-5600 and DDR4-3200 memory configurations, which makes it quite versatile. The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D also supports DDR5-5600 memory with a maximum capacity of 192 GB, but it focuses exclusively on DDR5. AMD's approach includes 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes directly from the processor, while Intel only offers 20 PCIe 5.0 lanes directly from the CPU. For power, Intel's Core i9-14900K specifies a base TDP of 125W but can ramp up to 253W under maximum turbo conditions, while its AMD competitor stays relatively conservative with a TDP of 120W, thanks to its smaller process node. While it is hard to declare a winner by simply looking at specs on a sheet of paper, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D does look more impressive in this round simply because of the ace up its sleeve: AMD's 3D V-Cache. Intel doesn't have anything in its arsenal to match that, at least on paper. We also chose the formidable RTX 5090 for testing to remove any GPU bottlenecks. You can also check out our in-depth reviews of the two CPUs (linked above) for a more comprehensive analysis. Of course, this disparity stems primarily from AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which drastically reduces latency in cache-sensitive games, allowing the CPU to feed the GPU more efficiently at 1080p. Similarly, Hitman 3 reveals a massive 35% advantage in average FPS. Furthermore, the 9900X3D's superiority in 1% lows is critical for stutter-free gameplay. In The Last of Us Part 1, we found the Ryzen 9 9900X3D to be 3.5% faster in 1% lows, reducing hitches during intense scenes; meanwhile, in other games like Cyberpunk 2077, the 1% lows are more or less evenly matched. The frametime advantage arises from the 3D V-Cache's ability to minimize frametime spikes by keeping frequently accessed game assets readily available, whereas the 14900K relies on higher clock speeds and DDR5 bandwidth, which struggle under complex, erratic workloads. This results in a 36% higher efficiency rating, as shown by our FPS/W graph. AMD's chiplet design and TSMC's 5nm process allow the X3D to deliver higher performance at lower voltages, while Intel's higher power draw reflects its push for peak frequencies and use of an older process node. Intel's aggressive pricing gives it a 23% value edge in raw FPS per dollar. However, this metric overlooks platform costs and focuses solely on the CPU price relative to raw gaming performance. Putting it all together, it is clear that the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the superior gaming CPU, offering ~18% higher average FPS and ~13% smoother 1% lows than the Core i9-14900K, while delivering 36% better efficiency during gaming. While the 14900K wins on pure FPS-per-dollar and suits users taking a multifunctional approach, those seeking uncompromising gaming performance should choose the Ryzen 9 9900X3D. We can see that the 14900K takes a lead that is particularly pronounced in heavily multi-threaded tasks, where Intel's higher core/thread count and peak clock speeds often outweigh the benefits of AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, designed primarily for gaming latency reduction. In multi-threaded productivity, the i9-14900K demonstrates a significant overall edge. Our comprehensive multi-threaded performance ranking geomean places the Core i9-14900K at 547 points, compared to the Ryzen 9 9900X3D's 499 points, giving Intel a 9.6% performance advantage. This gap is reflected across key individual benchmarks. Similarly, Blender Classroom performance shows the Intel chip outpaces the AMD part by around 7%, while HandBrake x265 encoding sees a narrower but still present 1.1% Intel lead. Our single-threaded performance ranking geomean places the 14900K at 266 points and the 9900X3D at 251 points, giving Intel a 6% advantage. It is interesting to see that both CPUs are almost at parity in single-threaded workloads, but Intel pulls away significantly in multi-threaded performance. It delivers faster performance across the vast majority of tested productivity benchmarks, particularly in demanding multi-threaded applications where advantages frequently reach double-digit percentages. Combined with its significantly lower price point, the Core i9-14900K also presents a much stronger value proposition for users prioritizing productivity performance. The 9900X3D's strengths clearly lie elsewhere, primarily in gaming scenarios that heavily leverage its large L3 cache. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D's massive L3 cache fails to make much of a difference in productivity work, as Intel obliterates the competition with its superior core count and multi-threaded performance. The Intel Core i9-14900K delivers exceptional overclocking capabilities with full unlocked multiplier support and comprehensive voltage controls. Intel provides sophisticated overclocking tools, including the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU), which offers AI-assisted overclocking that adapts to individual systems and recommends optimal settings. The processor supports manual frequency adjustments, voltage tweaking, and per-core ratio controls, allowing enthusiasts to easily push performance cores. Intel's approach includes advanced voltage offset capabilities through V/F curve manipulation, enabling both positive offsets for higher frequencies and negative offsets for better thermal management. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D represents a groundbreaking shift in AMD's X3D overclocking philosophy. AMD achieved this breakthrough by repositioning the 3D V-Cache underneath the CPU cores rather than on top, significantly improving thermal management. However, the X3D architecture still presents thermal challenges for hardcore overclockers, with users reporting more aggressive thermal throttling and difficulty maintaining high all-core frequencies compared to traditional Ryzen processors. The processor supports manual frequency adjustments, voltage controls, comprehensive PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) for automatically boosting power limits, and Curve Optimizer for undervolting tuning. Users can achieve performance gains through both automatic and manual tuning; however, these gains can be comparatively limited because aggressive out-of-the-box tuning delivers the lion's share of performance at stock settings. The X3D processors deliver outstanding gaming performance thanks to 3D V-Cache, but this tech also limits the upside of conventional memory overclocking, particularly when using EXPO profiles. We've found sub-2% performance gains from memory tuning with the 9800X3D, which, from a pricing standpoint, is great for enthusiasts; you can buy a cheap memory kit and get nearly the full performance potential. However, this is also a letdown for manual tuning enthusiasts, as the potential upside of tuning is severely limited. For enthusiasts prioritizing maximum manual overclocking flexibility and extreme overclocking potential, the Intel Core i9-14900K is the ideal choice. Intel's mature overclocking ecosystem, comprehensive software tools, extensive voltage controls, and proven ability to achieve extreme frequencies make it the preferred platform for serious overclockers. While the AMD 9900X3D offers impressive gaming performance and newfound overclocking support, its thermal limitations and cache-related constraints make it less suitable for users who want to push absolute performance boundaries through manual tuning. The Intel platform's superior thermal scaling with exotic cooling and more predictable overclocking behavior ultimately makes it the better choice for dedicated overclocking enthusiasts. It also offers much more meaningful memory overclocking headroom. The automated PBO feature, paired with undervolting, can provide a simple pathway to performance gains; however, these gains are limited. Additionally, memory tuning yields comparatively smaller gains than with traditional processors, due to the 3D V-Cache's improvements in memory access. Based on our test results, the power consumption profiles of the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Core i9-14900K reveal fundamentally different design philosophies, with significant implications for efficiency and cooling requirements. Intel holds a slight edge in idle states. During active light workloads, such as YouTube playback, the gap narrows to 10% but still persists. This suggests Intel's hybrid architecture manages low-power states marginally better. Under sustained AVX loads, the divergence is stark, providing a more nuanced picture. This immense power draw by Intel is driven by its aggressive boost algorithms, pushing high core counts and clock speeds. AMD's 3D V-Cache technology and optimized TSMC node deliver superior efficiency in our benchmarks. This advantage persists in Cinebench 2024, where the 9900X3D delivers 65% better efficiency. The 14900K's extreme power draw, averaging around 330W-360W under load, necessitates robust cooling. Even custom liquid cooling loops should be considered by those users who can afford and maintain them. In contrast, the 9900X3D's peak power draw was found to be between 170W-200W across our benchmarks, which is far more manageable. A high-quality dual-tower air cooler or 240mm AIO is sufficient, reducing system cost, complexity, and noise. Intel's power spikes also create greater thermal management challenges for motherboard VRMs and case airflow. While Intel holds a minor idle advantage, AMD's dramatically lower load power consumption translates directly to easier cooling requirements and lower operational costs. The 14900K's superior performance in productivity work comes at a steep cost: an immense power draw and challenging cooling demands. These motherboards start at approximately $125 for basic B650 models, though quality options typically begin around $150-200, and premium X-series options can reach around $500. As for RAM, both CPUs support DDR5, which is the modern standard for high-performance systems, though the Intel chip also supports DDR4. A 32GB DDR5 kit (2x16GB), running at speeds like 6000MT/s, typically costs between $100 and $150. Cooling represents a crucial cost consideration where these two platforms diverge significantly. The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D's 120W TDP and peak power consumption around 160-180W make it relatively manageable with quality air cooling or mid-range AIO solutions. The Intel Core i9-14900K presents substantially higher cooling demands due to its 253W maximum turbo power, which can reach nearly 380W under demanding workloads. For pure upfront cost, particularly if utilizing DDR4 memory, the Intel Core i9-14900K platform offers significantly better value. However, as we often see with AMD's gaming-optimized X3D chips versus conventional CPUs that lack the innovative 3D V-Cache, the difference often boils down to your priorities. The 9900X3D leverages its revolutionary 3D V-Cache to secure wins in gaming performance, and the TSMC node and chiplet design help in peak power consumption rounds, offering a cooler, quieter, and just plain better gaming experience. Meanwhile, the Core i9-14900K flexes Intel's raw frequency prowess and core muscle, taking leads in productivity performance and overclocking headroom, while also undercutting its rival on purchase price. Its massive cache delivers exceptional frame rates in gaming, and its significantly lower power draw translates to easier cooling and quieter operation. Its higher peak clocks and proven overclocking potential extract formidable productivity throughput gains from tuning, and its lower initial price point frees up budget for other components. If your rig is focused on just gaming and you value power efficiency, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is your champion. If you regularly run heavily threaded applications alongside gaming and want to save a few bucks, the Core i9-14900K delivers exceptional value and raw power.

AMD's latest Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 driver release has caused quite a stir among users, but the company has now issued important clarifications. While the update moves Radeon RX 5000 (RDNA 1) and RX 6000 (RDNA 2) graphics cards into "maintenance mode", AMD has confirmed that these GPUs, along with discrete and handheld devices based on the same architectures, will continue to receive day-zero game support and essential driver updates. However, it has since been clarified that Windows 10 remains fully supported despite its end of life. This initially led to speculation that AMD had dropped official support for Microsoft's older operating system. According to AMD, Windows 10 will still receive full driver support, including the latest Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 release. As a result, AMD no longer lists it explicitly in the driver release notes, but the software and drivers remain compatible and supported. “To clarify, the new driver doesn't claim Windows 10 support because Windows 10 is in the End of Life stage as per Microsoft,” an AMD spokesperson explained. AMD's continued support gives Windows 10 users a bit more breathing room before they decide to make the switch. The clarification definitely comes as great news for PC users who are still stuck on Windows 10, especially those who haven't yet jumped to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations or personal preference. If you're still using Windows 10 and want to keep your PC running smoothly, there's no immediate need to rush the transition, especially if you have an AMD graphics card or integrated GPU solution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naturally, engineering the perfect apparatus is a difficult task, but researchers continue to discover astonishing ways to advance nuclear technology, the latest of which involves a tiny chip with not-so-tiny performance. In a recent release, University of Maine researchers announced new microelectronic sensors that tolerate both the radiation levels and extreme temperatures of a nuclear reactor's core. “Since many advanced reactors currently under development operate at these temperatures, there is a high demand on the sensors to monitor them,” Mauricio Pereira da Cunha, the project's principal investigator, said in the release. “The successful development of these sensors will address and alleviate technology barriers that currently hinder the rollout of advanced nuclear reactors.” The sensor is intended to live inside the furnace of reactors for nuclear fission, which generates large loads of energy by splitting two heavy molecules. Specifically, the researchers hope to install the sensors in advanced high-temperature reactors, which run on helium gas and contain ceramic materials to more efficiently and safely generate nuclear energy. This motivated them to spend the last two years developing and testing a sensor strong enough for the next-generation reactors—and, while they were at it, make the sensor tiny to widen its range of applications. Each sensor was 100 nanometers thick—roughly 1,000 times thinner than a strand of hair—and carried platinum-based alloy electrodes packed with alumina caps. Impressively, all seven sensors “remained functional” and “showed no signs of degradation” despite five days of the reactor blasting them at its maximum power, at about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius), the report explained. Early analyses also implied that the sensors were resilient against radiation, too. “In addition to extreme temperatures, we're now also exposing these sensors to intense, in-core levels of nuclear radiation at the same time,” Luke Doucette, the project's senior research scientist, said in the release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Though nearly 10 percent of Portland works in tech, Stumptown's business scene can sometimes seem to be in hiding, operating as a comfortable “third place” between the FAANG capitals to the north and the south. Much of Portland's tech industry action is tucked into home offices and coworking spaces, or beneath a canopy of trees in the so-called Silicon Forest sprawling out to the west-side suburbs of Beaverton, Hillsboro, and Aloha. This is where Nvidia cofounder Jensen Huang went to high school, and it's also where he planted an engineering outpost for Nvidia. It's likewise where a sizable chunk of America's semiconductor and microchip industry has put down roots, including wings for Intel and Microsoft. This low profile can make Portland a chill place to do business. It is also a nerd's paradise for hacker spaces and tech ephemera. Don't just plop yourself down in a sleepy downtown hotel—a rookie Portland move many a visiting executive or engineer has come to regret. Portland is most workable where people actually live, amid dense business districts filled with cafés and restaurants. The Jupiter NEXT hotel is the statement piece of Portland's eastside LoBu neighborhood just across the river from downtown, a modernist six-story sculpture of a building with a balcony, bamboo garden, and bookable meeting rooms for large or small groups. Corporate discounts and packages are available for frequent business travelers, which include complimentary drink tickets at Hey Love, a popular ground-floor cocktail bar that's a bit like a tropical fern bar from the '70s. Not far from Jupiter NEXT is the only North American location of Icelandic hostel KEX, a 28-room boutique with private rooms and event spaces. For business travelers, KEX gets a good-neighbor discount at startup-centric coworking space CENTRL across the street, where you can book a meeting space or coworking berth. Visitors can usually walk in for foie gras dumplings and steam burgers (which sound like a Simpsons joke and taste like heaven) at Canard, the wine-filled casual sister restaurant of James Beard Award-winning French prix-fixe spot Le Pigeon next door. High-rise luxury sauna and cold plunge spa Knot Springs, offering river views from hot or cold water, sits near KEX. The best advice around Southwest Portland's downtown core is to stay above 9th Avenue, in the residential and restaurant-packed West End. For longer stays, local execs tell us a favored location is the Marriott's Residence Inn at the edge of Portland's tony Pearl District just north of downtown, within easy reach of light rail to the airport—with small kitchenettes for leftovers or snacks, and an onsite gym and pool. Nearby Jamison square is a dense corner of upscale eateries and bars. The most acclaimed food in the neighborhood comes from nationally recognized Mexican chef Angel Medina, at prix-fixe Republica (reservations recommended) and its nearby a la carte cousin, Lilia Comedor. CENTRL is a midsize West Coast chain of coworking spaces with four locations in Portland that offers flexible and low-friction arrangements for drop-in business travelers. Relatively low-frills meeting rooms are also rentable by the hour. WeWork is back from the brink these days, and Portland has one of the more modern locations, with flexible day work options and a pleasant enclosed patio—plus the requisite craft beer taps and table tennis. If your company has a WeWork membership, this is where you'll be—amid high rises overlooking Portland's convention district. This luxe coworking space at the edge of Portland's western suburbs is a perfectly located way station for those doing business in the chip-filled Silicon Forest west of Portland. Day passes and meeting rooms are available, in a sleek and high-ceilinged space attuned to corporate clients, with an attached health club. Here are the spots that best let you mix excellent brew with Wi-Fi and a power outlet. Roseline is a midsize roastery with a few locations around Portland that offers perhaps the best mix of work-friendly spaces and truly excellent coffee—ranging from forward-thinking light roast drip coffee to balanced espresso shots. Looking for a café where you're likely to find Portland tech intelligentsia? This sophisticated multi-roaster hall of espresso is your spot, with shots from far-flung roasters on offer. In Downtown Portland's museum blocks, Behind the Museum Café is a lovely respite, opened by owner Tomoe Horibuchi with a focus on small Japanese snacks, excellent tea, and coffee from local roaster Extracto. Electrica is a brick-walled multi-roaster café that offers excellent tea, coffee roasted in Japan or Thailand, espresso tonic drinks, and Mexican-style coffee—all at the edge of an electric fixture store. Few in this country are on Toya's level, from its classic shoyu broth to wild modern inventions like a brothless ramen carbonara with hand-massaged noodles. The menu is equally schooled in sake and shochu highballs. Akkapong “Earl” Ninsom founded multiple Thai restaurants in Portland that rank among the best in the country, including Beard-awarded prix-fixe Royal Thai restaurant Langbaan. None are as distinctive as EEM—a mix of tiki cocktail, slow-smoked Texas barbecue, and Thai curry that must be tasted to believe. You will order the white curry with brisket burnt ends. And you will talk about it to your friends for years. Ask for the Ruskie Zakuski, an endless parade of Slavic treats including Kachka's iconic bright pink “herring under a fur coat” salad. Then order dumplings, from savory pelmeni to sour cherry vareniki, fine caviar with butter and blini, and flutes of infused vodka distilled by the restaurant. Try Kachka's newly opened Fabrika spinoff at 2117 NE Oregon St. Portland has multiple excellent classic steakhouses, notably downtown's El Gaucho and the 80-year-old Ringside Steakhouse. Argentine-inflected Ox is special, from its famous smoked bone-marrow clam chowder to the delicate chimichurri atop its prime cuts of beef. But Ox's true secret weapon is its facility with the farm-fresh vegetables that have made Portland dining famous, whether flash-fried cauliflower offset by sweet golden raisin or heirloom carrots dappled with truffle-salted pistachio. It's the rare steakhouse where I'd bring a vegetarian. The traditional haunt of Portland's startup tech industry, the Pearl District's Teardrop Lounge is a national landmark amid modern cocktail aficionados—Portland's equivalent to New York's Death & Co. You can reserve the Crybaby room next door, or just walk in to the horseshoe bar for apricot-chili cocktails or delicately balanced Manhattans infused with strawberry and basil. (For a smaller, more casual but equally accomplished cocktail haunt rightfully beloved by the city's bartenders, try Rum Club at 720 SE Sandy Blvd.) In a hidden upstairs hall with the vibes that recall the secret library of a big game hunter, Multnomah Whiskey Library holds more than 1,500 liquor bottles that include some of the rarest whiskeys in existence—aspirational bottles some know only as rumor. The Library can be notoriously hard to get into. Hale is a more intimate affair than Cate's flagship. There is a truly Portland style of food-filled pub, one you can find in most of the city's neighborhoods: a classic hardwood-burnished place with low orange light, oddly elegant cocktails, a carefully chosen beer list, a few off-track glasses of wine, and much better food than you'd expect. Maybe the most refined is North Portland's Interurban, a bastion of low-key excellence. (For a lower-key, punkier experience—with a terrific beer and cocktails and perhaps the city's best smash burgers—pop up the street to Tulip Shop Tavern at 825 N. Killingsworth St.) Portland-area's Silicon Forest arguably sprouted in the mid-20th century with early electronics companies such as Tektronix, but the term was coined amid a 1980s boom in Japanese investment. Portland's western suburbs are now a hub for engineering talent and account for more than a tenth of the national semiconductor industry, boasting spokes of Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Here's where to eat and play when visiting west of Portland. But for decades, Chennai Masala has been Hillsboro's default answer for southern Indian food—a well-appointed room you want to spend time in and which can host large groups. Lunchtime is the buffet, but dinner is better, including some of the region's best crispy dosas, lentil crepes stuffed with spiced potato filling. Excellent casual Indian restaurants: Some of the best biryani in the region can be found at an unassuming strip mall restaurant called Hyderabad Hub (18033 NE Evergreen Pkwy, Hillsboro). Apna Chat Bhavan (1815 NW 169th Place, Hillsboro) is a casual thali spot adjoined to a grocery store, with excellent Southern Indian specialties in particular. Beaverton is a short hop from the largest semiconductor and chip plants of Hillsboro. Just at Beaverton's border with Portland, Hansik is a new and buzzy entry with plenty of space for larger groups, and a reputation for excellent grilled meats—including a prime rib ssam set with a variety of greens to wrap up the tender meat, and sizzling stone griddle bibimbap, plus indulgent tteokbokki rice cake appetizers and hearty, spicy yuk gae jang beef soup. More excellent Korean food: For terrific Korean fried chicken and late-night snacks and drinks, stop in at 1st Street Pocha (12590 SW 1st St., Beaverton). Comfortingly homestyle Korean soups and dumplings, plus seasonal noodle dishes, are tucked in an upstairs nook in the back of G-Mart supermarket at Always Spring (3975 SW 114th Ave., Beaverton). Old-school Korean fare with excellent seafood pancakes, spicy tofu stews, and endless banchan can be had at Nak Won (​​4600 SW Watson Ave., Beaverton). In a capacious former bank building with vaulted ceilings, find more local beer than some states even brew. Loyal Legion offers cocktails, pub food, and 99 taps of Oregon beer—from lager cleaner than spring water to the hypiest hazy and silly mango lime sour. It is the endless house that nerd built. With spaces designed by revered architect Kengo Kuma, the Portland Japanese Garden is widely regarded as the purest example of its form outside Japan—a serene space of cultivated wabi-sabi and serenity that was first dedicated 60 years ago. Portland doesn't have a signature cuisine or dish, like gumbo in New Orleans. Northwest Portland's Slabtown neighborhood offers a great walking tour. Begin at Breakside Brewery, possibly the most award-winning brewery in the state, and drink literally anything: IPA, lager, stout, or sour. A block away, at Ruse Brewing (1505 NW 21st Ave.), delight in Detroit-style pizza and some of the state's best IPAs and lagers. A 10-minute walk takes you to Brujos Brewing (2377 NW Wilson St.), a metal-themed brewery known nationwide for super-saturated hazy IPAs and big-bodied stouts. Pair terrifically balanced IPAs with truly excellent pub grub at Grand Fir Brewing (1403 SE Stark St.) In a city with few traditional visitor attractions, one of the most common suggestions is that you should go to a bookstore. Powell's City of Books, a four-story bookstore at the edge of Portland's downtown that takes up an entire city block, is an impressive monument to books—often the first thing a visitor to Portland will remember when they think of the city.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. In 1974, five years before he wrote his Pulitzer Prize–winning book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, Douglas Hofstadter was a graduate student in physics at the University of Oregon. “Part of my luck was that I couldn't keep up with them,” he said. Hofstadter instead decided to test out a more down-to-earth approach. Rather than proving theorems, he was going to crunch some numbers using an HP 9820A desk calculator—a computerlike machine that weighed nearly 40 pounds and could be programmed to perform complex computations. Hofstadter needed it to solve a particular formulation of the Schrödinger equation, which lies at the core of quantum mechanics. When fed certain information about an electron and its environment as inputs, the Schrödinger equation describes how the electron will behave. The team of mathematicians in Germany knew that when alpha was rational—that is, either a whole number or a fraction—solving the Schrödinger equation was arduous but possible (so long as you had a big enough calculator). But when alpha was irrational, meaning that it could not be written as a fraction, they had no idea how to solve it. He programmed his calculator to take a rational value of alpha as an input and print the output on a roll of paper. Every evening, Hofstadter would leave his calculator whirring. He taped together a few pieces of graph paper and, using a felt-tip pen, began meticulously graphing these energy values. These energy values depend on the crystal's magnetic flux, which measures how much force the electron is subjected to. Hofstadter's colleagues couldn't understand the point of his laborious approach. “Finding meaning and patterns in numbers when they don't exist.” But the butterfly that began to emerge on his graph paper intrigued him. Hofstadter noticed that when he entered a fraction, the allowed energies would be broken up by long stretches of forbidden values. His gut told him that it reflected a deep mathematical truth. “It was very clear to me that I had a tiger by the tail,” he said. The set is named for the mathematician Georg Cantor, who popularized it in 1883 by following a simple rule: Take a line segment, split it into three equal sections, then erase the middle third. This leaves you with two segments separated by a gap. If you carry out this procedure infinitely many times, you get an infinite set of points, spread out like dust along the number line. Hofstadter would never plug in an irrational value of alpha. Irrational numbers can't be expressed as a fraction—it would require infinitely many digits in the numerator or denominator, something that was impossible to program the calculator to handle. And so, he hypothesized, when alpha was irrational, the possible energies would form an actual Cantor set. Several years later, two prominent mathematicians came to the same conclusion from a very different direction. Barry Simon and Mark Kac had been studying what they called almost-periodic functions. But an almost-periodic function traces out a path that comes very close to repeating, yet never does. It was exactly the kind of phenomenon they'd been studying. And based on what they knew about almost-periodic functions, Hofstadter was right: The allowed energy levels should form a Cantor set when alpha is irrational. But Simon and Kac couldn't prove it either. Kac said he'd buy 10 martinis for anyone who could. The mathematician Mark Kac once offered 10 martinis to whoever could solve an important problem in quantum theory. He died before the proof was completed in 2004. Above, a group of mathematicians who worked on the problem celebrate the proof in his honor at a conference held that year. Over the years, mathematicians chipped away at it, proving the conjecture for certain irrational values of alpha (but not all). Simon announced one of these intermediate results in 1982. When Kac died in 1984, the problem remained open. A proof worth all 10 martinis wouldn't appear for another 20 years. What's more, he'd used techniques she'd published earlier to do it. “All the hard work was in my proof, and then here he comes with this beautiful argument.” So she was surprised when a 24-year-old mathematician named Artur Avila visited her and suggested they work on the remaining values of alpha. Their proof, which they posted online in 2005, was eventually published in the Annals of Mathematics, the field's most prestigious journal. Avila later won a Fields Medal in part for his work on the problem. “We had plenty of celebratory beverages, martinis included,” Jitomirskaya said. Svetlana Jitomirskaya has spent decades studying subtle patterns that emerge from the quantum behavior of electrons. But in some ways, the proof was a bit unsatisfying. Jitomirskaya and Avila had used a method that only applied to certain irrational values of alpha. It was a patchwork quilt, each square stitched out of distinct arguments. “You've verified it for this one model, but what does that have to do with reality?” said Simon Becker, a mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. And when you do, the 10-martini proof stops working. “This was always disturbing to me,” Jitomirskaya said. Avila and Jitomirskaya moved on to other problems. If an experiment ever saw his butterfly, he'd written in Gödel, Escher, Bach, “I would be the most surprised person in the world.” They placed two thin layers of graphene in a magnetic field, then measured the energy levels of the graphene's electrons. The quantum fractal emerged in all its glory. “Suddenly it went from a figment of the mathematician's imagination to something practical,” Jitomirskaya said. And a new collaborator had an idea for how to do it. He had been inspired by the work she and Avila had done on the 10-martini problem, as well as by a direction of research that Avila had been trying to pursue ever since. Avila had grown tired of the piecemeal approaches that mathematicians used to understand almost-periodic functions. He instead began to develop what he called a “global theory”—a way to uncover higher-level structure in all sorts of almost-periodic functions, which he could then use to solve entire classes of functions in one go. Lingrui Ge helped develop a new way to understand the solutions to almost-periodic functions, important equations that appear in quantum physics. He realized that some of those geometric properties could help him solve the original function. But it only worked for certain types of functions. But Ge was intrigued by the geometric objects that Avila had described. He suspected that other properties of those objects hid even more information—information that might illuminate aspects of the dual equation. “I could see that it was a very beautiful and important theory,” Ge said. It also allowed Ge, Jitomirskaya, and You to write a single proof that solved versions of the 10-martini problem in lots of different settings. The mathematicians have since used their version of Avila's global theory to solve two other key problems in the area. “We found this hidden mystery behind the global theory,” Ge said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. You can spend hours scrolling through lists of the best artificial Christmas trees and still end up wondering what to buy. Are the branches strong enough to hold that lopsided homemade macaroni ornament you've hung on your tree since 2004? We decided to settle the debate once and for all by bringing the best-selling artificial trees from three leading brands into a studio for a blind-judged contest. We got 10 trees from Balsam Hill, King of Christmas, and National Tree Company, then found 10 assemblers to put the trees together and fluff them. Next, our panel of three interior-designer judges assessed the results. Be sure to check out WIRED's other seasonal buying guides, including the best smart Christmas lights, advent calendars, and stocking stuffers. We researched artificial Christmas trees online to see what other publications and user reviews had to say, and then lined up the 10 most popular and talked-about trees. Among them were Balsam Hill's Classic Blue Spruce, National Tree Company's enduring favorite Dunhill Fir, and an Amazon best-seller you can get for under $300. All trees were the same height at 7.5 feet, and judged under the same studio lighting and free of ornaments. (All prices shown below are for 7.5-foot-tall trees.) The trees were delivered to my home and then transported to a photo studio in Overland Park, Kansas, where 10 testers gathered on a Wednesday morning. The assemblers knew which brand and model of tree they had, but were not told about the cost or reputation. Some of the trees came with included gloves to help in the fluffing process, but we issued utilitarian latex gloves to anyone who didn't have them. Assemblers had an hour and a half to unbox, unload, build, and fluff each tree; most were fully assembled in about 45 minutes. Tree stands were built and branches carefully unpacked and snapped into the tree base, then fluffed and bent into shape in time for the judges to arrive. Everyone had the same amount of time to assemble and fluff their tree, all of which were the same size. Once the trees were ready, three judges—interior designers from Kansas City-based firm ML Designs—arrived to evaluate them and pick the best fake Christmas tree. Each judge was given scorecards with a rubric that added up to 25 total points. The judges scored each tree on five categories on a scale of 1 to 5: realism, fullness and shape, branch structure, needle quality, and overall appeal. The goal was to find out which tree truly looks the best when there's no logo or price tag swaying opinion. • Maureen Lindstrom is a principal at ML Designs in Kansas City, Missouri, with 15 years of interior design experience. • Marianne Mayer is a senior designer at ML Designs with 10 years of inerior design experience. • Jill Connard, also with ML Designs, has been in the interior design space for 15 years. Balsam Hill trees are well-known among fake Christmas tree enthusiasts for their ability to mimic the look and feel of fresh-cut evergreen trees. We found that the brand twinkled brightly in a blind competition, without relying on reputation. No other tree compared in thickness, and it looked incredibly luxurious. The tree's branches slope upward naturally, making it easy to hang ornaments, and the mix of needle types gives it a realistic texture. It looks and feels expensive,” one judge noted. She also pointed out that there was no shedding, and judge Marianne Mayer agreed that the branches were extremely sturdy. The tree also comes pre-lit with LED lights that you can control with an app—get the model which does both color and clear if you want the option of having either white or colored Christmas lights. Most importantly, it looked lifelike, full, and festive without much fluffing. Flocked trees—that is, trees covered in artificial white snow made from a blend of cellulose fibers and adhesive—can be divisive. (Then again, several assemblers who said they are not typically fans were still wowed by this tree.) King of Christmas' King Flock, meant to mimic a subalpine fir, nails the fresh-snow look, something that's often surprisingly hard to pull off. Its branches are incredibly thick, which makes the tree look full and realistic. Hanging ornaments may prove to be a little tricky, but the winter wonderland look is still stunning. King of Christmas is a top-rated artificial Christmas tree brand with options that run from extremely inexpensive ($280) to ultra high-end ($3,300). After we wrapped, he did add that disassembling the tree was a lot tougher than putting it up, but the shedding was still pretty minimal for a flocked tree—you won't end up feeling like someone set off a glitter bomb in your living room. “This one feels like Christmas,” Maureen Lindstrom pointed out during judging. Aside from some built-in lights, there aren't a whole lot of frills, which is exactly the point. King of Christmas nails the balance of realism and fullness here, blending PE and PVC needles that mimic real pine while filling out the shape. The result is a full, voluptuous-looking tree without too much bulkiness. Its sturdy branches can easily support heavy ornaments without sagging, and there was almost no shedding. Overall, it's a tree that balances a realistic silhouette with practical durability, which is perfect if you love your tree stocked with ornaments. If you're the type who wants to manipulate your tree every which way, National Tree Company's Dunhill Fir is for you. The result was a classic, dark-green tree that looks full and natural. Judge Maureen Lindstrom noted that the wrapped inner pole added to the realism: “Like it was just pulled off a truck." Between the flexible branches and soft needles, this tree is perfect for hands-on decorators who want to fluff, shape, and customize every inch. This Fraser Fir earned its spot for ease of assembly. Its assembler had the tree fully set up in mere minutes, needed minimal fluffing time, and spent the rest of the hour tinkering just to see if he could make it look any better than it already did. As a whole, all three judges thought the tree looked great: Lindstrom said the needles looked good from afar, and Connard concurred. Overall, it's a quick-to-assemble, solid-looking tree that may be best dressed in just lights and ribbons. King of Christmas's Yorkshire Fir isn't going to fool anyone up close, but it's not without its charms. However, Mayer noted that the trunk is pretty visible despite fluffing, and the needles have a somewhat papery feel, so it's not exactly main tree energy. Still, with a tidy silhouette and good color, the Yorkshire Fir could happily find its home in a secondary or softly lit space. Balsam Hill Classic Blue Spruce for $799: The Classic Blue Spruce from Balsam Hill has a nostalgic look that many seek in an artificial Christmas tree. However, judges agreed that it didn't feel premium; Lindstrom noted it reminded her of her first-ever tree as a young adult. Hykolity Artificial Christmas Tree for $130: This one is one of Amazon's top sellers, and has a 4.5-star average rating, so we had to test it. It mostly delivered on expectations; judges agreed that it'd be best suited as a budget-friendly option or in a kids' room. One assembler noted that each light strand needs to be plugged into the next after assembly, which was a little confusing at first, but otherwise setup was pretty straightforward, and the price tag is inviting. National Tree Company Dunhill Fir (Pre-Lit) for $361: This one shocked everyone in the studio, especially when compared to its fraternal twin, the non-pre-lit Dunhill Fir, which ranked much higher. Dubbed the “Charlie Brown Tree” by both judges and assemblers, it looked very bare even after lots of fluffing. The top branch wouldn't sit upright for a star or angel; cords were exposed throughout, and there were large gaps that couldn't quite be hidden by fluffing. What looked promising in product photos didn't translate in person, making this one a disappointing pick for anyone hoping for a full, reliable tree. A good rule of thumb is to choose a tree that leaves about 6 to 12 inches between the top (with the topper on) and your ceiling. For standard 8-foot ceilings, a 7- or 7.5-foot tree usually looks best. But if you keep the same tree for more than five years, it can have a lower carbon footprint than buying a real tree every year, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. What Is the Estimated Life Span of a Fake Tree? The lifespan of an artificial Christmas tree depends on its quality, materials, and care. On average, a good-quality tree can last 7 to 10 years, while higher-end models may last up to 15 years with proper maintenance. While a quality artificial tree is an investment upfront, you'll save money by reusing it year after year. Plus, there are no yearly disposal costs. What Is Needed to Complete a Tree? A finished Christmas tree is whatever you want to make of it. You can also throw in some ribbon, garlands, or decorative picks for extra texture and depth. According to Balsam Hill, PE (polyethylene) is the preferred needle material for replicating the look of real trees. Shape branches in different directions for a natural look. Depending on the tree, you may need protective gloves to protect your hands from poky branches and needles. Pre-lit trees are plenty convenient, but replacing lights can be tricky if they burn out. How Do You Put Lights on a Christmas Tree, and How Many Feet Do You Need? Govee recommends about 100 lights per foot of tree height. How many lights per food is dependent on brand; check out the brand we recommend in our guide to the Best Smart Christmas Lights. Flocking is the process of adding artificial snow to a tree. How Can You Keep Pets Away From Your Tree? If it still feels wobbly, place heavy objects like sandbags or small weights on the stand's legs to make it more bottom-heavy. Avoid low-hanging ornaments and skip tinsel, which can be inviting for curious paws. Using a decorative fence or baby gate can also help keep pets away. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

The U-Scan takes a small sample and analyzes it on-site with miniature biochemical sensors inside an interchangeable cartridge. U-Scan Nutrio analyzes your diet, checking for biomarkers like bio-acidity, hydration status, and ketone levels, which shows that you've started burning body fat instead of sugar. U-Scan Calci also checks for calcium, which is a sign that you might have kidney stones. Results are then transmitted via Wi-Fi to the Withings app. The U-Scan packages start at $380, which comes with one U-Scan, either Nutrio or Calci, one cartridge, and two to four scans weekly (each cartridge lasts about 2.5 months). Replacement cartridges are $100 for one cartridge or $180 for two, and Withings sends you the cartridge automatically depending on which package you select. Samsung has long offered its own browser on its smartphones—Samsung Internet—but now the app is finally available on another platform: Windows. Considering Samsung makes Windows laptops and Android phones, this move allows folks who use the company's browser to share their browsing history and bookmarks between phone and laptop, and if you have saved passwords with Samsung Pass, you can use it to autofill passwords on websites. The company is taking this opportunity to bring some Galaxy AI features over as well, including Browsing Assist, which lets you instantly summarize webpages or translate them to another language. Samsung says its browser also blocks third-party web trackers, and there's a Privacy Dashboard that lets you see what has been blocked. Samsung Internet for PC is only available as a beta right now, but anyone in the US or South Korea on Windows 11 or Windows 10 (version 1809 and above) can download it now. Samsung also quietly teased its long-awaited trifold smartphone (a folding phone that has three screens) at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit this week in South Korea. The device, which doesn't have a name, was on display, but no one could touch it. Samsung told SamMobile it still plans to launch this smartphone in 2025, perhaps as early as next week, though it may be restricted to a few markets for now, such as China and Korea. Insta360 has released a smaller, lighter 360-degree camera, the X4 Air. Still, for casual consumers looking to get started in 360 video, the X4 Air's $400 price makes it approachable. The body is also considerably smaller, making it easier to mount on helmets and other locations where weight and aerodynamics matter (a big reason why we like the GoPro Max 2 more than the Insta360 X5). Like its larger cousin, the X5, the X4 Air is capable of 8K video, though it has smaller sensors and will likely deliver slightly lower quality video. Other differences include a less robust feature set. Nothing's phones have been a breath of fresh air in the design department, and the Nothing Phone (3) claimed a place in our Android phones guide because of its interesting aesthetic. Available in black or white, the Nothing Phone (3a) Lite has that trademark translucent back with a subtle red highlight and a retro font that extends into the pixelated user interface. There's a decent 5,000 mAh battery, but the phone only supports wired charging at 33 watts. Here's more you may have missed this week: The camera can be a weak spot for budget phones, though we were quite impressed by the regular Nothing Phone (3a) and (3a) Pro. IP54 water resistance, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.3 support round out the respectable specs. Competitors abound in this price bracket, from Xiaomi's Poco sub-brand to OnePlus, so Nothing is relying on its unique look and interesting software customizations to help it stand out. OnePlus has been slowly dripping news about its next flagship smartphone over the last month, and now we finally have an official announcement date: November 13. So far, we know the OnePlus 15 will be one of the first smartphones powered by Qualcomm's next-gen Snapdragon 8 Elite 5 chipset. While OnePlus has officially ended its partnership with Hasselblad, it has been playing up a new image processing algorithm called DetailMax Engine to assure you that the cameras are still capable. Speaking of, there's a new mode called Ultra-Clear 26MP, which lets you capture photos at 26 megapixels for a sharper image. The latter color is the only one with a micro-arc oxidized metal frame, which offers a “ceramic-grade coating” that OnePlus claims is 1.3x harder than titanium mid frame. OnePlus says it will share more details, including pricing and availability, on November 13 via a livestream on its YouTube channel. The Japan Mobility Show saw a raft of exciting new EVs being unveiled, but, for WIRED, smaller was most definitely better as Honda stole the limelight with the world premiere of its Super-ONE Prototype kei car, a ultracompact EV that will supposedly sound like a combustion hot hatch, complete with seven simulated gears to shift through via paddles on the steering wheel. This one, however, is most definitely not a wannabe hot hatch with its short hood, upright windshield, sliding doors, and near-vertical rear end rounding out the total length of 133.7 inches. Those dinky 15-inch alloy wheels all boast disc brakes, too, but the car itself is front-wheel drive. The 20 kWh battery should be good for around 112 miles of WLTC range, and despite the small size the Racco is expected to be compatible with fast charging of up to 100 kW—all for about $16,500.
