                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most scientists believe this cosmic visitor, which is on a trajectory that will bring it closest to Earth just before Christmas, shows all the hallmarks of an icy comet and will pass harmlessly over us, never coming closer than 170 million miles to our planet. But Avi Loeb, 63, a Harvard astrophysicist, has drawn both fascination and ridicule for suggesting that the object might not be a comet at all — but an alien spacecraft sent to probe our solar system. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer — known as Juice — may soon be able to provide answers. The European Space Agency says it will have “excellent vantage points” for observing the object from this weekend, while Earth-based telescopes will regain sight of it from mid-November. “If you were a cave dweller finding a cellphone, you'd say, ‘It's a type of rock I've never seen before,'” Loeb told The Sunday Times, summarising what he calls the dismissive attitude of his peers toward anything unconventional. Loeb said this “very massive object” is the fastest interstellar visitor ever recorded. It was first spotted in July by a telescope high in Chile's Atacama Desert, part of Nasa's Atlas early-warning system for detecting objects that might collide with Earth. Soon, observatories around the world trained their lenses on what is only the third interstellar object ever recorded passing through our solar system. • If aliens find Earth, they'll probably come from this direction Loeb, a former chair of Harvard's astronomy department and respected for his work on the first generation of stars, co-authored a paper in July highlighting the possibility that the object might be artificial — an “interesting exercise in its own right,” he said, and “fun to explore”. “Any suggestion it's artificial is nonsense on stilts — an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object,” said Chris Lintott, an astronomer at Oxford University. Francisco Diego, a lecturer in astronomy at University College London, agreed. But the criticism has not stopped Loeb from pursuing his alien hypothesis. For the past two weeks, 3I/Atlas has been hidden behind the sun, and he is suspicious of what it might have been doing while out of sight. “It might have broken up by now after coming close to the sun — then obviously it's a natural object,” Loeb said. But a technological object might have used the sun for a gravitational assist, either to accelerate or to slow down, he added. “From the next images, we'll be able to tell if it's been manoeuvring.” Loeb puts the odds of it being an artificial craft at 30 to 40 per cent — enough, he argues, to justify preparing for what could be a “black swan event”, or the arrival of an alien “Trojan horse”. The object will be closest to Earth on December 19: “I hope this thing doesn't bring us any Christmas gifts,” he added. “That it should follow this trajectory has a likelihood of one in 500,” he said. Initially, researchers assumed that 3I/Atlas was made mostly of water. “The [James] Webb [space] telescope showed that only 4 per cent of what's coming off it is water. Some fellow astronomers accuse Loeb of pandering to the public fascination for UFOs. He co-founded the Galileo Project, a research initiative at the Harvard–Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics devoted to searching for evidence of extraterrestrial technology. In May, he testified at a congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena, saying that “there are objects in the sky that we don't understand” and calling for greater funding for UFO detection. He has also claimed that up to 10 per cent of metallic fragments recovered from the Pacific Ocean contain “alien” elements not found elsewhere in our solar system. To Loeb, Oumuamua's unusual, pancake shape and behaviour — it appeared to accelerate unexpectedly away from the sun — hinted that it might be a relic of alien technology, perhaps a long-silent beacon or solar-powered “sail” launched millions or billions of years ago by a now-extinct civilisation. “We've put a lot of space debris up there,” Loeb said, referring to rocket stages, satellites, probes, and even the cherry-red Tesla Roadster Elon Musk put into space and which is now orbiting the sun. “These objects might one day be pushed out of the solar system as the sun grows brighter — they'll become interstellar objects. But other technological civilisations might have pre-dated us by billions of years. The good news for Loeb is that telescopes are only getting better. “The observatory in Chile is expected to find a new interstellar object every few months in the coming decade,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pope's newly appointed astronomer, Father Richard D'Souza, has stated he would be willing to baptize an extraterrestrial being. He acknowledged that religion would need to "reimagine itself" if humanity makes first contact with extraterrestrial life. However, he maintains that such beings would be creations of God and thus eligible to join the faith. Father Richard, 47, has recently been named chief astronomer to Pope Leo XIV, a position that places him at the intersection of religious belief and scientific understanding at the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo near Rome, reports the Daily Star. Father Richard recognizes that the discovery of intelligent alien life would profoundly shake both religion and human history. Yet, he is open to welcoming aliens into the Catholic Church. Theology would have to reimagine itself and take into consideration these other beings." He explained: "They are all part of God's creation. He did note there would be logistical challenges to address before such a ceremony could take place. The astronomer said: "We do believe that baptism has to be in presence." He added: "The question would be how to reach them or how they would reach us." "These are the practical problems to solve before we even talk about baptism." Born in India, Father Richard studied theology and philosophy prior to his ordination as a Jesuit priest in 2011. After joining the Vatican Observatory in 2016, he has contributed papers to multiple scientific journals and now has an asteroid bearing his name. When asked about having his name attached to the celestial body, he said: "It was a nice feeling, it is an honor. "Asteroids are the only things you can name after a person." "I become a galactic archaeologist and I try to infer the past history of a galaxy," he said. He anticipates scientists will determine whether alien life exists 'in the next 30 years' because 'science is pushing for that'. "We have historically looked for signals coming from outer space and over the last 30 years we have found none. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who use AI too often are experiencing a strange and concerning new psychological condition, experts have warned. As people turn to bots for friendship, romance, and even therapy, there is a growing risk of developing dependency on these digital companions. These addictions can be so strong that they are 'analogous to self-medicating with an illegal drug'. Worryingly, psychologists are also beginning to see a growing number of people developing 'AI psychosis' as chatbots validate their delusions. 'When one's hold on reality is already tenuous, that illusion can be downright dangerous.' When Jessica Jansen, 35, from Belgium, started using ChatGPT, she had a successful career, her own home, close family, and would soon be marrying her long-term partner. Just one week later, Jessica was hospitalised in a psychiatric ward. What Jessica later discovered was that her then-undiagnosed bipolar disorder had triggered a manic episode that excessive AI use had escalated into 'full-blown psychosis'. 'During my crisis, I had no idea that ChatGPT was contributing to it,' Jessica told the Daily Mail. By the time Jessica was hospitalised, ChatGPT had led her to believe she was a self-taught genius who had created a mathematical theory of everything. 'If I had spoken to a person, and with the energy that I was having, they would have told me that something was wrong with me,' says Jessica. Experts believe that the addictive power of AI chatbots comes from their 'sycophantic' tendencies. Chatbots don't say no, tell people that they are wrong, or criticise someone for their views. For people who are already vulnerable or lack strong relationships in the real world, this is an intoxicating combination. Professor Søren Østergaard, a psychiatrist from Aarhus University, told Daily Mail: 'LLMs [Large Language Models] are trained to mirror the user's language and tone. Dr Østergaard reviewed Jessica's description of her psychotic episode and said that it is 'analogous to what quite a few people have experienced'. While AI isn't triggering psychosis or addiction in otherwise healthy people, Dr Østergaard says that it can act as a 'catalyst' for psychosis for people who are genetically disposed to delusions, especially people with bipolar disorder. However, researchers are also starting to believe that the factors which make AI particularly prone to causing delusions can also make it highly addictive. Hanna Lessing, 21, from California, told Daily Mail that she initially started using ChatGPT to help with school work and to look up facts. Experts say that it is typically a form of delusional disorder, in which people form intense beliefs that are at odds with reality. For people who might be predisposed to delusions, using AI too much can reinforce patterns of behaviour that lead to psychiatric episodes. However, AI psychosis is not yet recognised as a diagnosis, and some psychologists think the term 'psychosis' might be too broad for the kinds of delusions AI is triggering. However, Hanna says she began 'using it hard' about a year ago after struggling to find friends online or in person. She says: 'One thing I struggle with in life is just finding a place to talk. I just want to talk about these things and thoughts I have had, and finding places to share them is hard. While Hanna says she doesn't know anyone experiencing the same problem, the evidence is beginning to suggest that she is far from alone. A recent study from Common Sense Media found that 70 per cent of teens have used a companion AI like Replica or Character.AI, and half use them regularly. Professor Feldman says: 'People who are mentally vulnerable may rely on AI as a tool for coping with their emotions. From that perspective, it is analogous to self-medicating with an illegal drug. 'Compulsive users may rely on the programs for intellectual stimulation, self-expression, and companionship – behaviour that is difficult to recognise or self-regulate.' The user said: 'I was already kinda depressive and didn't feel like talking to my friends that much, and with ChatGPT, it definitely worsened it because I actually had something to rant my thoughts to. 'It was just very easy to dump thoughts too, and I would always get immediate answers that match my energy and agree with me. Dr Hamilton Morrin, a neuropsychiatrist from King's College London, told Daily Mail that there isn't yet 'robust scientific evidence' about AI addiction. However, he adds: 'There are media reports of cases where individuals were reported to use an LLM intensively and increasingly prioritise communication with their chatbot over family members or friends.' While Dr Morrin stresses that this will likely affect a small minority of users, AI addiction could follow the familiar patterns of behavioural addiction. Dr Morrin says the symptoms of AI addiction would include: 'Loss of control over time spent with the chatbot; escalating use to regulate mood or relieve loneliness; neglect of sleep, work, study, or relationships; continued heavy use despite clear harms; secrecy about use; and irritability or low mood when unable to access the chatbot.' The company wrote: 'It aimed to please the user, not just as flattery, but also as validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions in ways that were not intended. 'Beyond just being uncomfortable or unsettling, this kind of behavior can raise safety concerns—including around issues like mental health, emotional over-reliance, or risky behavior.' In a recent blog post, the AI giant warned that 0.07 per cent of its weekly users showed signs of mania, psychosis, or suicidal thoughts. While this figure might sound small, with over 800 million weekly users according to CEO Sam Altman, that adds up to 560,000 users. Meanwhile, 1.2 million users – 0.15 per cent – send messages that contain 'explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent' each week. In a post on X earlier this month, Mr Altman wrote: 'We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. With so many users, if even a small proportion of people are being pushed into psychosis or addiction, this could become a serious problem. Dr Morrin concludes: 'Increasing media reports and accounts of models responding inappropriately in mental health crises suggest that even if this affects a small minority of users, companies should be working with clinicians, researchers, and individuals with lived experience of mental illness to improve the safety of their models.' At the time, Musk also revealed he was investing in AI companies not to make money but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. 'It would take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate.' Despite his fear of AI, Musk has invested in the San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, in DeepMind - which has since been acquired by Google - and OpenAI, creating the popular ChatGPT program that has taken the world by storm in recent months. During a 2016 interview, Musk noted that he and OpenAI created the company to 'have democratisation of AI technology to make it widely available'. In November, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, which became an instant success worldwide. ChatGPT is used to write research papers, books, news articles, emails and more. He says the AI is 'woke' and deviates from OpenAI's original non-profit mission. 'OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft, Musk tweeted in February. The Singularity is making waves worldwide as artificial intelligence advances in ways only seen in science fiction - but what does it actually mean? In simple terms, it describes a hypothetical future where technology surpasses human intelligence and changes the path of our evolution. Experts have said that once AI reaches this point, it will be able to innovate much faster than humans. There are two ways the advancement could play out, with the first leading to humans and machines working together to create a world better suited for humanity. Former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil predicts it will be reached by 2045. He has made 147 predictions about technology advancements since the early 1990s - and 86 per cent have been correct.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian revealed why she doesn't believe Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969: "Why does Buzz Aldrin say it didn't happen?" Well, Kim Kardashian isn't so sure that step was actually taken. As the All's Fair star revealed, she's someone who keeps up regularly with conspiracy theories. So much so, that Kim has taken to sending her costar Sarah Paulson articles "all the time," including one that explores the longstanding notion that the 1969 moon landing was not real. "I think it didn't happen," Kim told Sarah during the Oct. 29 episode of The Kardashians, later adding in a confessional, "I think it was fake." "I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen," she explained. "He says it all the time now in interviews. And after suggesting that sister Khloe Kardashian have the 95-year-old as a guest on her Khloe in Wonder Land podcast, Kim launched into a few examples of why the theory is still floating around out there. "Why does Buzz Aldrin say it didn't happen? "They're going to say I'm crazy no matter what," she said. Indeed, rumors that the moon landing isn't real have persisted for years, with many believing 2001: A Space Odyssey director Stanley Kubrick was behind the fake out. But when it comes to Buzz's alleged claim, that stems from an interview he did with Conan O' Brien in 2000. After Conan revealed he remembers watching Neil and Buzz land on the moon, Buzz can heard telling the talk show host that he “didn't,” adding that “there wasn't any television, there wasn't anybody taking the picture.” However, as Reuters—who fact-checked and debunked the suggestion in 2022—noted, Buzz was referring to the type of media (animation) shown around that time, clarifying that Conan was likely watching a recreation of sorts and not live TV. As for Buzz himself, he's not only had a fierce reaction to naysayers but earlier this year, he even celebrated the 56th anniversary of the historic event with a heartfelt message. “I couldn't be prouder to have completed this mission with the hundreds of thousands of people that helped get us to the moon and back home,” he tweeted in July, in part. In the 2010s, fans noticed the “Lavender Haze” singer's affinity for high-waisted pants, prompting an online wave of conspiracies, including that she was an alien born without a belly button. “I don't like showing my belly button,” she told Lucky magazine in 2014. However, after paparazzi snapped pics of the singer and her friends wearing bikinis while vacationing in 2015, she ultimately posted snaps of herself in the swimsuit to Instagram. “We realize, ‘Okay so they got pictures of us in our bikinis, like I don't want them to make like $100,000 for stalking us,'” Taylor recounted on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast Show in 2015. “So we're like, ‘Get up on the bow of the boat, we're taking better bikini shots, so they don't make as much money on theirs. The “Sk8er Boi” rocker reacted to online theories that she died in the early aughts and was replaced by a doppelganger named Melissa, who supposedly was hired before the singer's “death” to stand in for her at public events due to Avril's exhaustion. “I mean, it's just funny to me,” the “Complicated” singer said on a May 2024 episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast. “On one end, everyone's like, ‘You look the exact same. But then other people are like, there's a conspiracy theory that I'm not me.” Though the Grammy winner—who is now mom to daughter Blue Ivy and twins Rumi and Sir with husband Jay-Z—iconically debuted her first pregnancy during a performance at the 2011 MTV VMAs, she became the subject of theories that she wore a fake belly bump and enlisted a surrogate. Fans thought Beyoncé's baby bump appeared to deflate during an appearance on an Australian TV show months prior, which the singer shot down as “stupid, ridiculous and false” through a rep at the time. Is Anne Hathaway's Husband the Reincarnation of William Shakespeare? Katy Perry Reacts to Theory She's Actually JonBenét Ramsey On a February 2025 Instagram post of the theory, Katy simply commented, “wait am i.” "You know there have been rumors about me seeing and all that? "Truth is, shortly after my birth, I became blind.” See people in the spirit of them, not how they look. Check out the hottest fashion, photos, movies and TV shows!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As always, we have a bunch of new games for you to check out this weekend, along with fresh looks at some upcoming projects and a release date or two. But first, I really enjoyed this week's edition of The Guardian's Pushing Buttons newsletter. The publication's video games editor, Keza MacDonald, wrote about spending a day in a theater playing what sounds like the ultimate pass-the-controller game with dozens of other people. The aim is to help a herd of unemployed donkeys get their jobs back. 'Tis the season for scares, so of course we have to include some creepy games in this week's roundup. There was some buzz this week around The Séance of Blake Manor from Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury. You'll encounter strange goings-on as you conduct the investigation amid a gathering of mystics who are looking to speak to the dead on All Hallow's Eve. The Séance of Blake Manor is out now on Steam. The regular price is $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 10. The Run is a choose-your-own-adventure-style interactive film from PRM Games, Benacus Entertainment and RNF Productions. It's an FMV experience in which you help a fitness influencer (played by Roxanne McKee, who appeared in Game of Thrones) make decisions and try to survive the masked figures who are hunting her in northern Italy. Legendary giallo filmmaker Dario Argento makes a cameo appearance too. You'll also be able to check it out at the Genesis Cinema in London. A two-month residency of The Run just started there. Solo developer Yannick Audéoud (aka Misty Whale) spent a decade making his debut game, Orbyss, and now it's out in the wild. This is a puzzle game that sees you switching between orbs to solve puzzles — bit like in Cocoon. Instead of a beetle that carries such spheres, you technically play as "a firefly of energy" that can bounce between the objects. Orbyss has time-manipulation puzzles and ones that involve drones. The regular price is $15 and there's a 15 percent discount until November 12. Death by Scrolling is the latest game from Ron Gilbert's Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse Software. The idea here is to stay alive long enough and earn enough gold to pay a ferryman and escape purgatory. I'm probably not going to jump into another roguelite for a minute since I'm still recovering from my time with CloverPit and Ball x Pit, but I definitely want to try out Death by Scrolling at some point. It'll typically run you $8 on Steam, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 11. Golden Retriever Simple Life features Pichu, the pet pooch of developer Pablo Coma (Rablo Games). Going on walks and learning tricks is part of the fun too. There's no release window as yet for Golden Retriever Simple Life, which is coming to Steam. In the meantime, you can stay up to date on the game's progress with developer updates Good Boy Diaries from Pichu. I've seen Egging On pop up from time to time and I've been looking forward to checking it out. Fall too far and... well, you can probably guess what happens. The multiplayer survival game is slated to support more than 150 players per server and there are plans to expand that. You and your friends will take charge of genetically engineered beings and build a base that you have to defend from threats such as "failed clone experiments" and raids from other players. Things will change in this world even when you're not playing the game, so you'd better make sure your base is secure. Sharks are a major factor in Anchor as well. But, as in real life, they're attracted to blood, so any damage you sustain could spell doom. Fearem is the developer of Anchor, which doesn't yet have a release window. There's a lot going on in this trailer for Agni: Village of Calamity, which premiered during the ID@Xbox indie showcase this week. In this debut title from Separuh Interactive, you play as Agni, an investigator who undertakes an unauthorized investigation in a remote village. You'll need to solve puzzles and fend off monsters as you try to uncover the village's secrets and find your missing partner. Agni: Village of Calamity is steeped in Indonesian folklore. The one large monster that speaks in a childlike voice is quite unsettling. I'm intrigued to learn more about this survival horror game. Let's wrap things up for this week with one more survival horror tale. There's often horror in beauty and vice versa (take a look at Silent Hill f, for instance). But an affliction takes over the area, causing the spread of flora that snares victims and turns them into monsters. Unclear Games is taking an old-school approach here as it's using a fixed-camera design. You likely know the drill here: solving puzzles and defeating foes is your only way to stay alive. Finding out information about floral specimens will be helpful too. If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.</p>

Calling all fans of the supernatural. 

An encore presentation has been scheduled for an immersive evening inside the haunted Pinckney Community Public Library.

Paranormal Author and Investigator Nicole Beauchamp and her team, the Tri-City Ghost Hunters Society, will host a special in-person event on Saturday, December 13th at 1:30pm at the Library located at 125 Putnam Street. 

Beauchamp and her crew will share their “chilling results” from their personal paranormal investigation conducted by her team on-site at the library and the public investigation held earlier this year in April. 

Through photos, EVPs, and firsthand accounts, “attendees will get an exclusive look into the building's haunted history—and the spirits that may still linger”. 
Beauchamp will not have books for sale at this presentation but organizers said she will be available to sign items brought to the event. 

The event is free. 

Registration begins December 1st and can be done by calling the library at 734-878-3888 or by visiting the provided link.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A popular UFO-reporting app has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways — phenomena which high-ranking US Navy officials warn could pose a threat to national security. Enigma, which touts itself as the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” claims it has received reports on over 30,000 Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena since launching in late 2022. As of August, Enigma has also logged more than 9,000 mysterious sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines or major bodies of water — 500 of them within 5 miles — with more than 150 of the reports describing objects hovering above or descending into waterways, according to Marine Technology News. The app has released maps plotting out the reported sightings, represented as clusters of orange dots running up and down the east and west coasts. UFO sightings are nothing new, and are often dismissed as crackpottery by much of the scientific community or relegated to the stuff of science fiction, but retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet warns UFOs with the ability to go from air to sea without crashing or even creating a splash could have “world-changing” ramifications. “The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” Gallaudet wrote in a March 2024 report. Alarm bells were raised in July 2019, when the USS Omaha recorded a UFO/UAP that vanished into the ocean without a trace after buzzing a Navy fleet off the coast of San Diego. Video of the incident was verified by the Pentagon, displaying capabilities Gallaudet said “jeopardizes U.S. maritime security, which is already weakened by our relative ignorance about the global ocean.” In his 29-page report for UFO-focused think tank the Sol Foundation, Gallaudet said there's a documented pattern of similar phenomena being reported. “Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,” he wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fox News host Will Cain grilled retired astronaut Eileen Collins on various conspiracies on the moon landing in an interview Friday Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Fox News host Will Cain grilled retired astronaut Eileen Collins on various conspiracies on the moon landing, claiming that 25 percent of his viewership still believed it to have been faked. I don't come to you today — this is not a debate and I would not even classify myself as a skeptic,” Cain told Collins in an interview Friday. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins piloted Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, with Armstrong and Aldrin becoming the first two humans to walk on its surface. In response, Collins added that the moon landings were unprecedented historical events and that no one had known what was going to happen when the first men stepped outside the space shuttle. “No one had ever been to the moon before, and now they're taking a tremendous risk to their lives… and decades, 50 years later, we say it didn't happen. Cain shot back: I totally understand that argument, Eileen, but the point of our conversation is actually to address some of that skepticism and see if it doesn't hold weight, and the affirmative argument you're making is one that I find compelling as well. However, the points — points are still made and they're worth addressing as is always the case in anyone who has a counter argument. NASA recently responded publicly to reality TV star Kim Kardashian, after she claimed she did not believe the moon landings had happened during a recent episode of her reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Writing on X, NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote: “Yes, @KimKardashian, we've been to the Moon before… 6 times! “And even better: @NASAArtemis is going back under the leadership of @POTUS.

For psychics and mediums operating businesses in Massachusetts, the law requires them to obtain a license. 

To read palms and tarot cards, they need a license that is granted only to applicants who have lived in the city in town where they seek the license for at least 12 months.

But why?We're digging into the history of the law and how legislators today are working to amend it.
