                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Jacob Sanford, who also lit church on fire, was killed by police who responded to September shooting The former US marine who opened fire in a Michigan church and set it ablaze in September was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI said on Friday. “I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant's anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Mormon chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80km) north-west of Detroit, on Sunday, 28 September, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire. Body-camera footage released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling: “Drop the gun! “During our investigation, an additional individual was determined to be ‘injured' during the Grand Blanc critical incident,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The four people who were killed have been identified through family and friends as Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong. Lisa Louis, who was in the chapel when her father, Hayden, was fatally shot, wrote in a letter that after looking into the shooter's eyes, she forgave him “with my heart”. In October, top church leaders preached a message of love and forgiveness in the wake of the attack while gathered for the faith's twice-annual general conference in its home state of Utah. Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an online fundraiser for the gunman's family. Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI's statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears – that this attack was motivated by hatred”. “This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said. He said local Latter-day Saints have been uplifted by an outpouring of love from the Grand Blanc Township community and other religious congregations. Authorities have released little information about Sanford and the attack. People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ki-Shawn Crumity, 26, faces charges of human trafficking, sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of a child after police in Pittsburgh said they arrested him on Thursday. He is one of at least three men who had been arrested as of Saturday amid an investigation involving law enforcement agencies in multiple states. “This child … was groomed, exploited and then sexually abused by strangers who found her online,” Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murrill, said in a statement on Friday. The child was brought to a hospital, and there was evidence of sexual assault recovered, Guardian newsgathering partner WWL Louisiana reported, attributing that information to officials. Citing a criminal complaint, Pittsburgh news outlet WTAE reported that the girl spoke to investigators in detail about what had happened to her. She purportedly said she connected with Crumity on the social media platform Snapchat – and that he promised he would help get her adopted by a trusted adult. Crumity further gave the girl edibles – a term used to describe food products infused with cannabis – and sexually assaulted her repeatedly for about a week, she told investigators, according to WTAE. Crumity was denied bail after being booked into Pittsburgh's jail, police there said. Two other men were also arrested in connection with the girl's temporary disappearance. Ronald Smith, 62, was alleged to have been with the girl in Columbus, Georgia, and he is accused of simple kidnapping and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics warn the DHS database could wrongly flag citizens as noncitizens, risking voter access and trust. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver's license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship. The plan, outlined in a public notice posted Thursday, is the latest step in an unprecedented Trump administration initiative to pool confidential data from varied sources that it claims will help identify noncitizens on voter rolls, tighten immigration enforcement and expose public benefit fraud. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. Earlier this year, DHS added millions of Americans' Social Security data to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system, allowing officials to use the tool to conduct bulk searches of voter rolls for the first time. Incorporating driver's license information would allow election officials whose rolls don't include voters' Social Security numbers to conduct bulk searches by driver's license number. “It is the key that unlocks everything,” Morse said. State driver's license databases often include a variety of sensitive information on drivers, including place of birth, passport number, biometrics, address, email and employment information, said Claire Jeffrey, a spokesperson for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. Driver's license numbers are sometimes reused and people can have licenses in multiple states. “This could have far-reaching consequences for voter access and public trust if inaccurate data were used to question eligibility or citizenship,” Orey said. DHS says in the notice that linking to driver's license data, which it calls the most widely used form of identification, “will allow SAVE to match against other sources to verify immigration status and U.S. citizenship, which will improve accuracy and efficiency for SAVE user agencies.” Up until this year, SAVE was mostly used to check individual immigrants' citizenship status when they applied for public benefits. But the agency's data-sharing agreement with the Social Security Administration as well as Thursday's disclosure make clear that DHS and other agencies can use SAVE for other purposes, including for immigration enforcement investigations. Information uploaded into the system by state and local election officials and other users will be saved and may be “shared with other DHS Components that have a need to know of the information to carry out their national security, law enforcement, immigration, intelligence, or other homeland security functions,” the notice explains. In filings, the government has said that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that DHS would exercise caution in flagging voters as potential noncitizens. Some privacy lawyers called DHS' move to add driver's license information more evidence of federal overreach. The DHS notice, known as a system of records notice, allows for public comment on several aspects of SAVE's expansion, including some already completed. Typically, such notices are filed when agencies propose changes to federal systems, and the comments are meant to inform how officials go forward. In June, email records show, DHS asked the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver's licenses and ID cards, to partner on a pilot program to add its data into SAVE. Rebekah Hibbs, a supervisor in the Texas Department of Public Safety's driver's license division, replied that DPS is “always happy” to support the SAVE tool and agreed to talk again with USCIS. In response to questions from ProPublica and the Tribune, DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said the “department does not have any ongoing projects with USCIS related to driver record information for registered voters, nor have we been asked to provide that information.” She did not answer questions about whether DPS has given any data to USCIS. DHS did not respond to questions about whether the partnership moved forward. The results showed that around 0.015% of Texas voters, or 2,724 people, are potentially noncitizens. At least one Texas official is concerned that those initial SAVE results may not be accurate. In a court filing submitted Wednesday as part of the Privacy Act litigation, Travis County voter registration director Christopher Davis wrote that state data shows about 25% of the voters that SAVE flagged as potential noncitizens in the county had provided proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump is cancelling billions of dollars in federal funding for congressionally approved projects already underway. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. As the federal government shutdown drags on, the Trump administration has doubled down on a tactic of dubious legality that it has been pursuing since January: cancelling federal funding for already congressionally approved projects in blue cities and states. It followed up a month later by withdrawing another $175 million from the project. While these cuts alone won't kill off the project, for which California voters have already approved tens of billions of funding through raising bond revenue, they do make it harder for the state to complete vital parts of the rail system. The federal dollars were being used for everything from building stations to constructing viaducts and railway bridges. In 2019, when Donald Trump 1.0 attempted a similarly destructive maneuver against the high-speed rail system, California sued. Two years later, with Joe Biden as president, the funds were fully restored. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Between them, according to research by Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, these acts created 2.9 million jobs, 70 percent of which were aimed at people without college degrees. Now, many of these signature public sector investments are on the chopping block, as are many other investments deemed by Trump to be “Democrat priorities.” Subsequently, the corps, falling back on new “Department of War” media guidelines about not releasing non-essential information during a government shutdown, refused to publicly provide details as to which projects had had the pause button pressed on them. That same week, Trump announced on social media that he was “terminating” the Hudson Tunnel Project — a long-planned project that had garnered a $16 billion commitment from the federal government, to create a second railway tunnel, under the Hudson River, linking New York and New Jersey. That project, too, billed as the nation's largest ongoing infrastructure project, is already underway, and its completion has now been put into doubt by Trump's erratic politics-by-social-media-post behavior. All but one of the states that lost this money were blue states; the one outlier was New Hampshire, whose Republican governor was on Trump's shit list because she had stood up to him when he ordered red states to implement mid-decade redistricting to try to predetermine the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections. This game of raw power politics comes with a high cost. Yanking dollars from projects that are already underway means putting large numbers of jobs at risk. This game of raw power politics comes with a high cost. Yanking dollars from projects that are already underway means putting large numbers of jobs at risk — both the jobs of those working directly on the impacted projects and the secondary ones that are generated when those federal dollars circulate through local economies. Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that at least 11,000 people are currently working on the New York–New Jersey tunnel project. Beyond those numbers, however, he believes that at least another 11,000 are in jobs (in the restaurant industry and other service sectors) that would likely evaporate if all of those construction workers no longer had employment and thus income to spend locally. While the disappearance of 22,000 jobs in a metropolitan region with 6 million workers wouldn't in itself trigger a local recession, for the impacted workers those lost jobs could mean dreams shattered and the triggering of financial chaos. “The construction jobs will be very hard to replace,” Baker told Truthout. In a period when the residential and commercial construction industries are already in the doldrums, “They're not going to have an easy time finding other jobs.” While the states have already begun suing to protect their federal dollars, the economist anticipates that there will be different outcomes in different state lawsuits and that eventually it will fall to the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump's financial actions against cities and states that oppose his agenda are constitutional. “These are large amounts of money for local economies,” Thomas Palley, a D.C.-based economist who publishes the Economics for Democratic and Open Societies newsletter, told Truthout. There are material consequences to people who have businesses reliant on government contracting. People will put plans for business expansion on hold. At some point, Palley says, if the squeeze on blue states gets too extreme, those states might end up trying to respond by finding ways to interrupt the transfer of payments from state taxpayers to the federal government.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fighting for control of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week. The Ukrainian military's commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.” “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense. For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk. Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk. As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia's energy and military infrastructure. On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country's defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines. “The ‘Koltsevoy' oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine's Defense Intelligence (DI). It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air. “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said. There's been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. Ukraine began targeting Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory. “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.” Ukraine's President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as 20% of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages. Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that he personally apologized to US President Donald Trump for a regional government-commissioned commercial that used footage of Ronald Reagan to criticize trade tariffs. The ad, commissioned by the government of Ontario, deeply “offended” Trump, Carney told journalists at a press conference in Gyeongju, South Korea on Saturday. The commercial aired earlier this month and spliced clips of Reagan's 1987 speech on trade policy and his use of tariffs against Japan to suggest that the late Republican icon opposed protectionism. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute accused Ontario of using the material without authorization and distorting Reagan's record. Trump reacted angrily, accusing the Canadians of “egregious behavior” and announcing the suspension of ongoing trade talks with Ottawa. He also imposed additional tariffs on Canadian imports in response. The US president revealed on Friday that Carney had reached out to apologize and was “very nice,” though the talks remained suspended. “Ronald Reagan loved tariffs – and they tried to make it look the other way,” he said. Carney's remarks came after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which both leaders attended this week in South Korea. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra during an event at the Halifax Chamber of Commerce in September. He was appointed to the position by U.S. President Donald Trump in April.Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press We're not a real country and should just become the 51st state. Our economy will exist only to the extent that Donald Trump sweeps unwanted crumbs off his royal banquet table. If we find any of that obnoxious or insulting or just absurd given that the U.S. looks like it's about six months away from sinking into the sea under the weight of its own dysfunction, well, we're just being rude. And this week, the American ambassador took things up several notches. Pete Hoekstra unleashed a profane tirade on David Paterson, Ontario's trade representative to the U.S., at the Canadian American Business Council gala on Monday. Gary Mason: Washington, we have a serious problem: Your ambassador to Canada The rant was so intense that people nearby overheard how Mr. Hoekstra was enraged about the anti-tariff ad campaign that Ontario Premier Doug Ford launched in the U.S. Mr. Hoekstra's wife, Diane, circled back to apologize to Mr. Paterson afterward. The first occurred in 2015, when Mr. Hoekstra said, “The Islamic movement has now gotten to a point where they have put Europe into chaos. Act 2 opens in 2017, when a Dutch reporter interviewed him about his impending job as ambassador. Mr. Hoekstra's eyes went flat with fear when the man asked about those remarks. That is actually an incorrect statement,” Mr. Hoekstra said, gravely, in response to the reporter's totally accurate recap. Then he tried to disarm things with a grin: “We would call it fake news.” (This on its own is incredible, because it was a public panel and there is video of Mr. Hoekstra saying these things while sitting behind a little placard with his name on it.) The reporter pushed back on him dismissing this as fake news. Which brings us to Act 3: Mr. Hoekstra's introductory news conference in The Hague. The Dutch reporters had a whole lot of questions about whether he would walk back those remarks, apologize or explain. One of them had Mr. Hoekstra turn and read a plaque on the embassy fireplace, inscribed with a quote from John Adams, the first U.S. envoy: “May none but Honest and Wise Men ever rule under this Roof.” The reporter invited Mr. Hoekstra, if he possessed either of those qualities, to take back his remarks or else name one politician who had been set ablaze. Mr. Hoekstra turned back to the press with a frozen smile and said, “Thank you,” then tried to point at another reporter for a new question. Mr. Hoekstra, then U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, gives a statement during a press conference at his residence in The Hague in January, 2018.The Associated Press His diplomatic output in this country has been laced with the edgy aggression of a minor bully punching a kid in the head, while glancing over to see if the alpha bully approves of his work. At a G7 business summit in May, Mr. Hoekstra made a lame joke about bad investments and when the audience reacted with befuddlement, he said, “Some of my friends in Canada don't have the greatest sense of humour.” “You may not like some of the things he says or whatever, but to describe the President as being uninformed, excuse me, you don't hear Americans talking about our disagreements with Canadian politicians and saying they're uninformed,” Mr. Hoekstra bristled. Mr. Hoekstra's aggression underlines how obnoxious and abusive the Trump administration has become. Canada has been swallowing indignities out of strategic necessity for months. In one scene, Ralphie is walking dejectedly home after he's had a rotten day. That's when Scut Farkus, the huge, terrifying, yellow-eyed bully, fires a snowball at Ralphie's face and mocks him as he starts to cry. Instead, he leaps at Scut, knocking him backward into the snow, and proceeds to beat the ever-loving snot out of him, while a crowd of kids watches in awe. Until now, Canada has adopted Ralphie's usual tactic of scurrying away in self-preservation. Still, there's no denying we have little leverage compared with our tormentor, and that limits our response in ways that are both pragmatically and emotionally unsatisfying. But maybe it's not Ralphie who will administer the comeuppance. No matter how many lies they're told, eventually Americans will feel the damage of Mr. Trump's trade war directly, unavoidably. Look at how the world is already remaking itself in real time, like one of those animated time-lapse maps that shows the continents shifting over millennia. It doesn't matter whom he sends to scream us into submission; everyone can see that the new American exceptionalism is becoming the world's basket case.

MOSCOW, November 1. /TASS/. Russia has maintained intense communication with Syrian officials, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told TASS.

"We have been in very intense talks with Syrian officials. As you know, another meeting of the intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation was recently held here," the senior Russian diplomat said, describing the event as important.

According to Vershinin, the recent meeting discussed improving bilateral relations 'across the board', among other issues.</p>

TORONTO (AP) — Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week, slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third inning and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers held off the Blue Jays 3-1 on Friday night to force the World Series to a decisive Game 7. Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. He lasted six innings and allowed a third-inning RBI single by George Springer, who returned after missing two games with a right side injury. Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for six outs before starter Tyler Glasnow came out of the bullpen to escape a ninth-inning jam and rescue the Dodgers. Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. He also started the last Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston.

BRUSSELS, November 1. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's "erratic policy shifts" have shaken Europe's confidence in cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States, Politico wrote citing sources.

According to the report, CIA Director John Ratcliffe made a low-key stop in Brussels this week to meet with EU officials and ease their concerns about intelligence sharing. The visit comes as the European capitals are growing increasingly worried about US foreign policies under Trump.

Sources told Politico that the "Trump administration's erratic policy shifts on Ukraine," such as such as an abrupt halt in the sharing of battlefield intelligence with Kiev in March, and its push to politicize intelligence by appointing Trump loyalists, have shaken European confidence in Washington's reliability.

According to sources, Ratcliffe met with the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, as well as senior officials from the EU Intelligence and Situation Center (INTCEN) and the EU Military Staff Intelligence Directorate (EUMS). The expectation is that the meeting won't be a one-off, the report says.</p>
