                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As YouTube TV‘s carriage talks leave many sports fans without access to their favorite college teams, ESPN is addressing the issue. The sports media company is making its pregame show College GameDay available for free on X and the ESPN mobile app immediately after it was one of several Disney networks to go dark on the platform ahead of the company's contract expiration. Available via X's live video function, with access including replays and bonus content, while the ESPN app offers push notifications and highlight clips, according to Cord Cutters. With Disney's networks going dark Thursday on YouTube TV, Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman joined ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro in expressing that YouTube TV and parent company Google are “not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,” in a memo to employees. “Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service,” they added. Meanwhile, a YouTube executive has told Deadline that Disney has been “unnecessarily aggressive and assertive” in the talks, but someone at Disney said that YouTube TV is “intentionally misrepresenting the situation.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On October 24, “Dancing With the Stars” alumni Peta Murgatroyd and her husband, Maks Chmerkovskiy, recapped “Wicked Night” together on her podcast. But when the two began making remarks critical of current season pro dancers Rylee Arnold and Jan Ravnik, fans of the two immediately jumped to their defense. A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars) On October 30, Maksim apologized to Jan, so everyone was waiting for Peta's response. “Before we get into this week's breakdown, I want to take a moment to address what happened last week,” Peta began her Halloween episode of her “Penthouse With Peta” podcast. “We never want to condone hate or personal attacks of any kind,” the two-time Mirrorball Trophy winner stated. She hoped to “learn from this and move forward, continuing to watch, support, and celebrate this show that we all love.” Maks and Peta sparked backlash when they debated Jan and Rylee's experiences, focusing mainly on Jan's lack of ballroom-dancing expertise. He stated that “Jan has absolutely no business being a pro on ‘Dancing With the Stars. '” He later posted a video on social media apologizing to Jan for hurting his feelings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATE SATURDAY AM: The lowest October in 27 years is coming to a close with the lowest weekend of the year at around $49M, no thanks to Halloween falling on a Friday, but the horror doesn't stop there: Anyone expecting a boost for business today has to deal with the final World Series game between LA Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays. Comscore reported earlier this week that October was coming in at $440M, which is the lowest October has ever seen since 1998, which did $455.5M. The biggest October ever belongs to 2018, which did $832.8M — there were three tentpoles that month with Venom, A Star Is Born and Halloween, which combined, did some $481M for the month alone. October 2024 brought in $478M, this past month being -8% off from that. The biggest October post-pandemic belongs to 2021, when moviegoers were coming back from Covid, and the month was stacked with Dune, No Time to Die and Venom 2, that frame amounting to $645M. After surprises such as Conjuring: Last Rites and Demon Slayer Infinity Castle in September, October dragged the fall box office behind per Comscore with $1 billion for the post Labor Day through Oct. 30 period, -2.2% behind the same period a year ago. On the plus side, the 2025 box office for Jan. 1-Oct. 30 is clocking $7 billion, +3% from a year ago, but still -24% from pre-Covid 2019 which grossed $9.26 billion by this point in time. Meanwhile per industry estimates, because Netflix doesn't report, KPop Demon Hunters at 2,890 theaters grossed $600K yesterday for what's shaping up to be a $3.4M second three-day weekend. As one distribution source predicted about the most watched Netflix title coming back to cinemas: “I don't think there's more juice left in that squeeze.” Bugonia, which cost a lot for a Yorgos Lanthimos movie at $45M, with a higher price for what Focus acquired it for, is coming in with the biggest opening for the offbeat filmmaker at $4.4M in its wide break from 17 to 2,043 theaters. Clearly the question raised will be, well, if we took out Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere last weekend, shouldn't we take out Bugonia? But they're two different movies: One is aimed at a hipster arthouse crowd, the other at older fans of a rock icon who didn't show up. If Bugonia can get to a $30M gross and $100M-plus global take, consider it a gross right in Lanthimos' wheelhouse: his Oscar winners The Favourite did $34.3M domestic, $95.9M global, and Poor Things wound up with $34.5M domestic/$117.6M worldwide. Focus is playing the Conclave date of the calendar rather than taking Bugonia out over Thanksgiving or Christmas which is where Searchlight played his previous two awards contenders. Note, Bugonia‘s weekend alone amounts close to the entire domestic run of his previous Searchlight dud, Kinds of Kindness, which only grossed $5M domestic, and $16.4M global in June 2024. 63% in 18-34 (a demo which the specialty distributors should make more movies for). Briarcliff Entertainment has the animated kids spooky pic Stitch Head which did $350K yesterday for what's looking like a $2.2M opening at 2,162. Best areas of play yesterday were South, Midwest and South Central, with standout markets being Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta. Twenty-six reviews from critics amounted to a paltry 69% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Roadside Attractions has the political thriller Anniversary, starring Diane Lane, Kyle Chandler, Dylan O'Brien, Phoebe Dynevor and Zoey Deutch, about a very close-knit family that is torn apart as a new movement “The Change” envelops the country. Directed and co-written by Jan Komasa, the pic counts 67% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes from 43 reviews, a $72K Friday and forecasted $247K 3-day from 809 theaters or a $305 per theater. PREVIOUS FRIDAY MIDDAY: In a weak box office weekend with Halloween festivities stealing audiences away today, Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 will pop back up to No. As we told you earlier, the last time Halloween fell on a Friday was 2014, and a Universal/Blumhouse horror movie ruled then: the second weekend of Ouija, with $10.7M. So goes the hope for all distributors that business comes roaring back on Saturday, but it's not expected to be anything to brag about. 2 between Paramount's feature take on Colleen Hoover's Regretting You and Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man, both estimated around $4.8M. RELATED: Ultimate Final Girls In Horror: From Laurie Strode To Sidney Prescott & Dorothy Gale However, Netflix's second go-round of KPop Demon Hunters could upset them both with a $5M+ take, that number not made official in midday forecasts. 1 chain AMC Theatres, this time around the Kansas-based circuit will be playing the Sony anime production along with Regal and Cinemark. Bugonia, Focus Features' wide break of Yorgos Lanthimos' fifth collaboration with Emma Stone, is eyeing a $4M second weekend after jumping from 17 theaters in NY/LA/Austin last weekend to 2,043. The new pic's second Friday of $1.7M includes $700,000 in previews from 1,700 theaters. Note that preview figure is ahead of Conclave‘s Thursday previews of $500K a year ago, which posted a $6.6M opening at 1,753 theaters, And it's not far from Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme, whose wide-break Thursday previews did $850K during the summer; that wide weekend — its second frame — posted $6.27M at 1,678. RELATED: 10 Terrifyingly Good Horror Triple Bills To Watch This Halloween Universal's re-release of Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future at 2,290, with the boost of Imax, is looking at a Friday of $1.55M, which includes $650K previews from last night in what's shaping up to be a $3.8M three-day total. Disney is hoping for a $4M+ second weekend on Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, but rivals see the Jeremy Allen White-led pic lower. After making $1.55M with the reissue of 2008's Twilight, Fathom Entertainment's re-release of that pic's 2009 sequel The Twilight Saga: New Moon did $590K at 1,504 theaters Thursday night. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse plays today, followed by Breaking Dawn Part 1 on Saturday and Breaking Dawn Part 2 on Sunday.

Otherwise it may have boosted the numbers. Too bad del Toro's new Frankenstein didn't get a real release… It's fabulous and it would have been a huge hit for Halloween weekend. Bugonia deserves the hype it has earned 100% imo. I was never a massive fan of the director's cinema but between this and Poor Things two years ago he won me over and then some. Bugonia is the best movie i saw in a theater this year. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark star Scott Wolf is showing his support for Ryan Seacrest after the “American Idol” host announced the heartbreaking death of his father. Seacrest shared the emotional news on social media, writing, “It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that my loving father peacefully passed away earlier this week. The “Party of Five” alum, who currently stars in FOX's medical drama “Doc” and the Hallmark hit “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” joined thousands of fans and celebrities offering sympathy to the longtime TV host and his family. A post shared by On Air with Ryan Seacrest (@onairwithryan) In his tribute, Seacrest reflected on the deep bond he shared with his late father, describing him as “a devoted husband for 56 years” and “an incredible Papa.” “I haven't shared this on the air because it has been very private for me and my family,” he said. “My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer years ago.” Wolf's heartfelt gesture comes during a personally turbulent time for the Hallmark and FOX actor. The 58-year-old recently made his highly anticipated return to television in FOX's medical drama “Doc” and Hallmark's holiday hit “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” while quietly navigating his separation from wife Kelley Wolf, a former MTV “Real World: New Orleans” alum. According to People, Kelley, who announced the couple's split in June, was placed under a psychiatric hold in Utah earlier this month, her third in four months, as she continues to face legal and personal challenges following the breakup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saddled with bad vibes since Henry Cavill left for greener pastures before it could drop season three, Netflix wants us to know that while Geralt suddenly looks different, the machinery of The Witcher is still clanging along. This season is so eager to gloss over Cavill's departure that it doesn't even bother with a glimpse of the new guy before chucking him into the fray. The premiere, tellingly dubbed “What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger,” reveals just how defensive the show is about who fleshes out Geralt's story. Recapped by a wide-eyed little girl in the episode's earliest moments, the major beats we've already seen from Geralt's life—his reunion with surrogate daughter Ciri (Freya Allan), his tempestuous romance with sorceress Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), his battle with the warlock Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu)—have been reshot with a new face under that silver mane: Liam Hemsworth. The Witcher, realizing the perceived messiness of recasting its lead at the latter end of its five-season run, wants to both reassert itself and start fresh, which explains this deliberate, brute-force attempt to erase Cavill from our minds. The Witcher shouldn't have gone to the trouble; its Geralt has always been more of a vessel than a character. Ha—The Witcher has rarely dwelled too long on Geralt's feelings and desires, even if they drive the story. Showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich's ensemble approach is much more interested in the world beyond him, like the courtly intrigues of Emperor Emhyr (Bart Edwards) or King Radovid (Hugh Skinner), Yennefer's shifting hierarchy of sorceresses, or the wars that shape Andrzej Sapkowski's famously murky Continent. The series doesn't suddenly shift its focus to Geralt just to accommodate its new (and presumably less fussy) leading man, and it shouldn't. Grasping the breadth of a well-established fantasy world is a challenge for any TV show, but harnessing Sapkowski's sardonic, elliptical scope and endless parade of characters has proven especially onerous for a series that has never quite decided what kind of dark fantasy series it wants to be. Bawdy and violent like HBO's Game Of Thrones, lore-dense and cryptic like The Rings Of Power, both, or its own freaky thing? This season of The Witcher, however, sets an endgame into motion. Recognizing that the Cavill-Hemsworth switcheroo will dominate every conversation about it from here to the White Frost, it has entered crisis mode, smoothing out plodding story arcs, establishing a clear us-versus-them narrative between Vilgefortz and the rest of the Continent, and beefing up its cast with character actors who can stabilize a show prone to drifting. Supporting Hemsworth's debut is Laurence Fishburne's Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy (Regis for short), a barber-surgeon in the Sweeney Todd mold whose bleak vampiric history is recounted in animation during the season's most vivid and confidently produced episode, “The Joy Of Cooking.” Fishburne, adopting a vague Euro-English accent, is in Morpheus mode here, offering gravelly wisdom to a hero whose loss of agency (or, rather, his silver sword and a wound he's incurred along The Path that stymies him) is compounded by the revelation that Emyhr intends to wed (and bed) Ciri. On the subject of Nilfgaard, James Purefoy displays a mix of world-weariness, menace, and charm as Emyhr's Baelish-coded spy/royal vizier Stefan Skellen, while Sharlto Copley stalks the season's perimeter as the bounty hunter Leo Bonhart, a killer who's hungry for blood and has a taste for witchers. Each of them adds spice to a series long since been rendered bland by the fantasy tropes it haphazardly employs. Whenever they're on screen (especially Copley, who brings a wild, almost alien energy to the show), The Witcher roars to life. The season takes a dreary turn as Ciri's youthful revolt lands her with the misfit outlaw gang The Rats, where she shares lusty smooches with Mistle (Christelle Elwin), a thief who shows her what it means to live as they engage in all sorts of performative rebellion. Who knows: The Rats are your typical ragtag fantasy crew, drug-fueled, quippy, and burdened with personal tragic backstories that serve vague narrative purposes. Their scenes are hard to watch, like a streaming Dungeons & Dragons campaign of cool nerds who vape and swear collegiately. Allan and her supporting cast do what they can with the flimsy material—Asse (Connor Crawford) is especially striking with a haunted gaze that hints at sadness the show barely acknowledges. Individually, they serve a crucial function in Ciri's still-evolving story; collectively, they're an additional suite of characters in an already overstuffed cast. Then there's Vilgefortz, who has finally ascended to the series' ultimate heavy. Hissrich frames him as a composite of other familiar genre tyrants, like Emperor Palpatine (whom Vilgefortz all but plagiarizes during the Hemsworth-less sixth episode), and, most obviously, Voldemort, not just in his story omnipresence, but in the goth-witchy company he keeps, besieging Yennefer and her Lodge Of Sorceresses with bargain-basement Death Eaters. In effect, the midseason plays out like a theatre camp Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, where the series' ceaseless preparation for its imminent magic war amounts to a room of LARPers waving their hands at each other while making constipated faces. This represents much of why The Witcher is thin gruel compared to Sapkowski's work; it wants to conjure awe and can only barely simulate it. To his credit, Hemsworth isn't bad at this Geralt business—he's less marble-sculpted than Cavill, perhaps, but he can swing a sword and brood convincingly enough. Still, there are brief moments where the transition feels seamless. “Trusting people isn't that bad,” Ciri tells him as he weaves her ashen strands into a mighty braid. That's how The Witcher would like us to see it. But while Hemsworth maintains the show's fleeting pleasures, its attempts at drama and character still leave much to be desired.

Hedda Gabler, as played by Tessa Thompson in “Hedda,” is a mercurial being in the way that Greek gods are. But DaCosta also wanted to stay true to her reading of the character: Hedda doesn't even know why she does what she does, or necessarily knows that she is going to act until she's already unlocking her father's pistol case. But DaCosta and her cinematographer Sean Bobbitt also put their thumbs on the scales when it comes to bringing Hedda's desires to the fore. The film uses playful visual techniques and some innovative technology to bring the viewer inside Hedda's volatile, passionate perspective.

As any fan of the Innie/Outie elevator on “Severance” (or, you know, that one shot in “Jaws”) is well aware, a contrazoom is an in-camera effect that induces a sense of visual vertigo. DaCosta and Bobbitt frame the moment so that nothing in the shot is larger or more centered than these two women are, suddenly locked into seeing each other. But then obviously [it] was popularized by Spike Lee. I wanted to have these moments in the film that feel outside of reality, and that was one of them,” DaCosta said. There is still an emotional reality that even these moments are grounded in, however. “Sean's a very curious, exploratory, interested collaborator, and he's so focused on emotion and story, so that really helps, too,” DaCosta said. “[We're] really trying to filter everything through character and not reference other films as much as we can, but reference other forms of art — painting, photography. For DaCosta and Bobbitt, they worked out what they wanted in rehearsals inside the already set-dressed English manor house where the story is set. “I'll have these ideas, and it's a lot of what ifs. What if we did a contrazoom but instead of distance and focal length, that was about light and f-stop, you know? We built a new rig, essentially, because I was like, ‘what if we took the head of the Trinity [camera stabilizer] and got rid of the post but put it right on the body, and then we have this really cool thing that looks amazing,'” DaCosta said. Hedda herself would demand nothing less than a film that looks amazing and keeps the audience on their toes. Bobbitt's and DaCosta's camera choices give the protagonist exactly what she wants. “Hedda” is now streaming on Prime Video.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To mark the end of our week-long spooky season coverage—in which we unpacked the impact of Stephen King's work, as well as discussed R.F. Kuang's Katabasis and talked horror films with Oz Perkins—we thought we'd look back on the lingering effects of certain scary flicks on our minds. Club staff: What's your most irrational fear inspired by a horror movie? Our answers range from Kubrick's take on The Shining to a fictional shark attack and gory, unconventional slashers. I couldn't drive, mind you, but I still managed to work myself into a cold sweat whenever my parents would pull up behind one of those infernal vehicles—something that happened quite a bit growing up in New England. I was just starting to get over it when a dude on Supernatural got impaled by a metal rod that had fallen off his own van in pretty much the same way the cop died by a flying, loose tree trunk in the infamous Final Destination scene. I wasn't near the ocean until I was entering high school, so as a landlocked kid, my family's summer vacations in Michigan (either near Lake Michigan, which back then felt very oceanlike, or one of the small Sister Lakes, which very much didn't), consisted of two things: Watching Jaws (and What About Bob?, which I'm just realizing as I type this also heavily features madness, an inescapable presence that's driving that madness, and Richard Dreyfuss) and a lot of swimming. I knew that a Great White making its way to the shores of South Haven was an absolute impossibility. Or, worse still, getting in the water at night, when it's dark and everything? If it weren't for seeing Alfred Hitchcock's game-changing horror film when I was way too young, there wouldn't be anything for me to even conceive of worrying about. And yet, for years after I saw it on TV, Psycho ruined showers and their opaque curtains for me—I vividly recall washing my hair as quickly as possible as an elementary schooler so that my eyes were only closed for the briefest of moments, lest I be stabbed to death by my local dead-mother obsessive. I'm not sure why I thought this was a common thing that was worth worrying about, or why I thought it would happen to me in my house rather than in a seedy motel, but that's the power of Hitchcock. It just turns out that it's way more likely to be from slipping and falling than being hacked up by a weirdo taxidermist. As a lifelong horror movie fan, I'm surprised I don't have more irrational phobias (the climax of 2004's Bollywood neo-noir, Ek Hasina Thi, did give me a permanent fear of rats). However, I walked away extremely nervous about elevators after The Shining, scared by what could await behind closed doors. Illogical as it may be, the question “What if I drowned in a rapidly approaching pool of blood?” was scary enough. To add to that, Nora's (Lynda Boyd) beheading in Final Destination 2 and a creepy escape scene in The Silence Of The Lambs compounded my claustrophobia. I'm obviously over it now—although an Evil season two episode almost succeeded at bringing back the phase when I would much rather climb up and down to avoid the possibility of getting trapped, stuck, and possibly killed in a tiny, inescapable space. Look: You know there's not a snake in my toilet right now. I know there's not a snake in my toilet now. I'm 41 years old, and my lifetime tally of toilet snakes is resting comfortably at zero. Does this mean that my brain does not—having apparently internalized the lessons of 2006 meme “thriller” Snakes On A Plane in a way I would have preferred it to have focused on some great, or at least less-toilet-based, works of literature—occasionally raise the question “Hey, what if there's a snake in there?” To which I say: I'm not on trial here, the toilet snakes are. Like everyone else in this post, I can probably chalk this up to having watched something much too young—but that's an occupational hazard when you grow up with older brothers and a video store with a “three for $5” special on horror movies every Thursday. In any case, seeing at least two adults buried alive in Wes Craven's The Serpent And The Rainbow (there could be more, I haven't rewatched it) convinced me that it was an all-too-common occurrence. The history of premature burials would seem to prove me right, though, which is why I came up with a contingency plan to save me from their fate (look up “safety coffin”). I don't worry about this quite as much now, but I still don't like being underground, even if it's just while riding the train. But that never stopped anyone from being terrified of Catholicism. So began my lifelong fear of being possessed by the devil, something I'm reasonably sure isn't going to happen—but still hesitate to get too cocky about. In hindsight, Regan's (Linda Blair) possession terrified me because it spoke to something that continues to scare me: Losing control of my body.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liam Gallagher has called out a fan who launched flares into the crowd during Oasis' opening Australian tour stop at Melbourne's Marvel Stadium on Friday night (Nov. 1), describing the individual as a “seriously f**ked up” person in a profanity-laced post on social media. Here's What The Alchemist Has to Say About No Rap Songs Being in Hot 100 Top 40 for First Time Since 1990 Here's Who Will Play The Beatles' Wives in Four-Part Fab Four Biopic Travis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Makes a Halloween Statement, Dressing Up as Toni Braxton in 'He Wasn't Man Enough' Music Video “Each time you saw this flash, it looked like a fire, and then it was contained fairly quickly,” said Virginia, who attended the show with her 13-year-old daughter. Gallagher, never one to mince words, addressed the flare-thrower directly on Saturday morning. During the performance, fans say Liam was visibly displeased, reportedly wagging his finger and mouthing “naughty, naughty” from the stage. It is unclear if there were any injuries as a result of the incident. The group is scheduled to play three shows at Marvel Stadium before heading to Sydney's Accor Stadium for two nights. Before taking the stage, Liam greeted fans with, “G'day Australia! Because we missed you!” The sold-out show drew massive crowds, with fans queuing from 5 a.m. to secure front-row spots and breaking into spontaneous singalongs outside the venue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hollywood loves Halloween, and the stars proved it this year with a wide array of costumes. Celebrities went all-out to celebrate the spookiest day of the year, sporting their best costumes by portraying everyone from beloved film characters to music icons. From recreating Kendrick Lamar's 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show look to a fictional Dr. Seuss character, there were no shortage of inventive Halloween looks this year. Most celebrities used the holiday to pay homage to various characters from beloved movies, including Mindy Kaling taking on one of her Running Point star Kate Hudson's most popular roles to Ed Sheeran as a classic horror icon. Talk Show Halloween Costumes: Miranda Priestly, Anna Wintour, Labubus and Steve Urkel Among Highlights The Queen of Halloween, too, stepped out this year for her annual bash. Read on for the best celebrity Halloween costumes of 2025, worn by stars including Lady Gaga, Niecy Nash-Betts, KeKe Palmer and more. “Happy Halloween to all the grave diggers,” she wrote on Instagram, concluding, “love, Mother Monster.” Niecy Nash-Betts and her wife Jessica Betts honored Kendrick Lamar's 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show performance by portraying the rapper and Serena Williams, respectively. In their joint Instagram post showing off the look, both Niecy and Betts took turns replicating Williams and Lamar's viral moves from the most recent Super Bowl. It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It's about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance” Mindy Kaling thanked her Running Point star Kate Hudson “for inventing yellow” in her 2025 Halloween Instagram post, where she dressed up as Hudson's character from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She wore an outfit similar to Andie Anderson's silky yellow dress paired with a blonde wig in the video, as Hudson complimented the look in her comment section, writing, “Ahhhh! The “Shape of You” singer went full horror this year as Pennywise from It. Ed Sheeran was unrecognizable dressed up as the killer clown, sharing a series of photos and videos of him strolling around New York City. Just like Halloween 2024, Paris Hilton wore an array of costumes to celebrate the holiday. As for her solo looks, Hilton paid homage to Michelle Pfeiffer in a recreation of her Catwoman character from Tim Burton's Batman Returns. She also “started off #Halloweek” with a homage to the princess of pop, Britney Spears, with her signature red latex outfit from the Oops!… I Did It Again music video. Coco Jones paid tribute to the Oscar-winning film Dreamgirls this Halloween, with a recreation of one of the film's iconic posters featuring stars Jennifer Hudson, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and Anika Noni Rose. Girl group KATSEYE poked fun at their viral moment on the red carpet at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards, where they were asked which of Mariah Carey's music videos was their favorite, and they seemingly had no answers. This Halloween, they dressed up as varying looks from Carey's music videos and did a separate social post where they each recreated Carey's Rainbow album cover look. do you ever get tired of serving so hard???

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You might have heard, but Britpop's greatest group returned this year in a blaze of summer-dominating, triumphal glory. Plus, easily missed, Oasis got back together, too. Odd as it is to say now, Live '25 wasn't a nailed-on success. Questions swirled: Would the irascible brothers keep their egos and fratricidal instincts in check? Any chance the setlist might show proof of their existence past 2002? Demand for the tour was insane, some 14 million trying for the UK dates alone, a nearly 600 percent leap on 1996's immortalised pair of Knebworth shows. With tabloids and legacy music media fixated on tracking the brothers' every move, even a brief pat on the back sent people doollally. Out went strappy tops and cigs, in came bucket hats and more cigs, as Planet Gallagher blotted out the sun. And lo, just in case you thought they hadn't raked in enough cash already, here arrives the 30th anniversary edition of (What's the Story?) As the world's most ardent proponents of Lennonism, the only comparison Liam and Noel will brook these days is against their idols. Socially, in 2025, Oasis are bigger than the Beatles. Chalk it up to heavy competition in the '60s, or a total collapse of aesthetic progression since the '90s, but you can only tackle the void in front of you, and Oasis did so with brutal efficiency. If you cup your ear today to the ballad of the pub man, you won't find gents in collarless grey suits harmonizing “Day Tripper” at closing time. What you will find, however, is middle-aged men greying around the temples and young lovers with live forever inked in cursive on their calves, arm in arm, belting one of modern rock'n'roll's universal standards: “Champagne Supernova,” “Wonderwall,” “Don't Look Back in Anger,” or, plausibly, all of the above. 's very own Big Three, nor why more tracks from the group's second LP found their way into the set than any other. The tunes are biblical, with mile-wide choruses, doubled strings, and triple-tracked Les Pauls rousing enough to win hearts and minds at scale. Their best song may lie elsewhere—not that, or that; yes, that—but it did establish the group as too big to fail, despite multiple attempts to stress test that assumption over the subsequent 14 years. Similarly, the argument that the Gallaghers only appeal to nativist boozehounds is clearly bollocks, even after a summer of rightward lurches and mortifying displays of cheap nationalism. The crowd at Wembley this August was transcultural, all walks spilling over in ecstasy. I've witnessed a comparable stadium atmosphere just once, in 2021, when a late penalty sent England's men's team to their first final since 1966. Even when memorable, it's liable to remind you of something else, although by now, many have come to prefer the taste of third-stage Baudrillardian simulacra over the original. “Some Might Say,” a right ol' dashboard-smacker, is so in thrall to the nicotine-stained ceilings of '70s pub rock that it apes not one but two of Ronnie Wood's bands. “Cast No Shadow”'s paean to a rudderless Richard Ashcroft remains touching, yet so narrow was the group's compositional lexicon, the opening bars manage to ape the very, very popular single you heard a mere five tracks earlier. “Wonderwall”... is “Wonderwall.” Anything more would just be padding word count. In spite of familiarity, probing this thing can throw up some interesting questions. Or that “Morning Glory,” a blatant Side 1, Track 1, is tucked away deep in the record's back half? Given Oasis' 1995 was one of the more extensively documented years any band could hope for, you'd have assumed at least a full vault show, but no. The remasters are identical to versions available elsewhere, with just five “Unplugged” versions of the boys' biggest tunes bundled in: aka Liam's original enunciation, facial muscles working overtime, undergirded by Noel's High Flying-style overdub. Pick of the curious litter is “Morning Glory (Unplugged),” whose menacing air-raid riff and scooped lows have been substituted for piano trills and a smattering of bongos. The track takes on a swimmy, almost camp quality; keyhole to some alternate reality where the boys never made it out of Burnage, but kept plugging away in village halls nonetheless. Naturally, they were too coked out their gourd to think of that at the time, so onwards they forged. Pin it on passive consumption habits, or the way streaming's economies of scale benefit those with pre-existing cultural capital, but along the way, Oasis also became even more popular internationally than in their first phase. You can't move on a certain plane of TikTok for 1994 fancams, or daughters gifting dads reunion tickets. From 2019 to 2024 alone, the band logged 10 billion streams worldwide. Blur, the Verve and Pulp could only muster 7.2 billion, combined. Only four songs from the '90s rank in Spotify's all-time top 100, and wouldn't you just know it, there's “Wonderwall” filling in a Dua Lipa/Benson Boone sandwich. A two-and-done lifespan would have airlocked the mythology: still substantially influential, but, with apologies to the city of Manchester, more Stone Roses than Rolling Stones. Instead, this downhill trudge past cooling international interest and dwindling sales at home—2008's Dig Out Your Soul managed just one-tenth of What's the Story's 18x platinum flourish in the UK—did one key thing that helped lay the groundwork for 2025's remontada. Healy, whose sax-fond softboism was the diametric opposite of Noel's dour glower, relished his status as chief tormenter by repeatedly baiting the bull. Arctic Monkeys, the only British group to come close to rivaling Oasis for impact in the decades hence, would even append their own lighters-up ballads with a little splash of “Anger,” a sop to its chordal cousin and a wink to the fact they were only keeping the throne warm until the pair stopped marding. All this must have driven them to distraction, but you gotta say, they really did have it coming. Liam, the man with a fork in a world of soup, seemed more motivated in the 2000s to spark up new feuds than attend to his evidently shot voice. There was never any reason for why the pair so frequently replaced mordant wit with spite, but you don't exactly need a degree to unpack it. “What can I say?” elder bro reasoned in Supersonic. That much we knew when What's the Story? The saga seemed to have reached its logical conclusion. Noel's parables of upward mobility had come true; Liam's clarion call of rolled notes and smashed pints had been answered with gusto. But this lot were always due to age out sooner or later, and it was tricky to foresee who would become the custodians of Brand Oasis. Brightside,” then FIFA and Nando's all weekend to take the edge off. are the only 20th-century heritage hits that cut through to a new generation reared on Calvin Harris. The album renders portraits of a 2D land where men are sympathetic arseholes and women their doting rocks; an emotionally stunted generation who duck therapy to appear on high-performance podcasts and Love Island instead; a country that stopped asking more of itself. The belief that any mess could be mopped up with enough cutting banter flows downhill from Liam's incongruent approach to life: charm and hate in perfect balance, proclaiming peace and love mere seconds before getting your front teeth knocked out in a bar brawl. Short wonder that a generation of copycats was captivated by their hero's ability to strut through the day absent of consequence, their ambition simply to get noticed, and perhaps mugged off, by him on X. Only one dream lay out of reach—that the saviors would return. Once the cultural reversal knocked them off their perch, a funny thing happened: The brothers started to show a little brio. From the backfoot, they returned to their most convincing form, with a chip on their shoulders and a point to prove. (Not uncoincidentally, this is why they never made a front-to-back good record again after 1995.) The road forked in 2017, following a terrorist attack that ripped through Manchester Arena, killing 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert. As a stunned city willed itself to its feet, impromptu renditions of “Don't Look Back in Anger” began to ring out. Liam, who showed up for the benefit concert while Noel did not, swiftly capitalized on rising goodwill. By now totally unable to escape his songbook's shadow, he leaned in, kickstarting a successful solo run fueled by the same self-determination that made for such an explosive emergence at 21. From there, the chers frères' rehabilitation began to feel like a fait accompli. Liam and Noel spent years chasing each other's tails in the public domain, a footrace of festival headline slots and press-hogging tit-for-tat: You play gigs honoring essential workers, I'll take it for Teenage Cancer Trust; you entertain a rabble of kids for Vice, I'll liquefy my innards on Hot Ones, etc. They remained hellbent on doing everything except breaking the dang bread. Even after Liam's supreme rattle, returning to headline Knebworth solo in 2022, and repeated attempts to goad Noel back into action, no detente lay in sight. Until, that is, they were each offered a hundred million reasons to see the situation differently. It did, at least, force people off the fence. Mates I expected to clamber aboard the S.S. Good Times were driven insane by the amount of cultural oxygen Oasis (Oasis!) took up in 2025, while latent ladettes broke their bucket hats out of storage and went on to enjoy the best gig of their lives. Whether you regard the album as a distillation of humanity's indomitable spirit, or a big fat nail in the coffin of curiosity, it's still the juggernaut against which future attempts are graded for a reason. But to regard them is to give into them, and through debate, the brothers have you right where they want you: paying attention. Now, as then, it's still one nation under Gallagher, until the bitter end. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Actress Catherine Corcoran just took her breach of contract dispute with “Terrifier” director Damien Leone and producer Phil Falcone to a Los Angeles federal court on Sunday. But allegations that the filmmaking duo has been bullying “Terrifier” contributors out of their fair credit and compensation predate Corcoran's new claim. Related Stories ‘A House of Dynamite' Star Tracy Letts Asks ‘If We're Really Done Here?' “I don't buy the excuse that they're from New York or New Jersey or whatever,” said another, who also worked at Dread Presents then. Asked about the sexual harassment alleged in the new lawsuit (Falcone is accused by name of photographing Corcoran nude without her consent while she was stuck in a special effects rig), he said, “I'm inclined to believe Catherine. They did not respond to IndieWire's request for comment on the additional allegations, despite repeated requests to get in contact with Leone, Falcone, and their defense attorney. Dread Central's parent company, Epic Pictures, acquired Leone's lo-fi horror film in 2017 ahead of their new label's official launch the next year. They were supported by several men at Dread who reportedly “hated” the movie and specifically took issue with its centerpiece kill featuring Corcoran, as IndieWire learned. If that is what this label is going to be, then I'm not the right person for this position,” said one source. As seen in the first “Terrifier,” the brutal murder of Dawn (Corcoran) — stripped naked, hung upside-down, and sawed in half from vagina to face — is widely considered the spark that ignited “Terrifier” mania as we know it today. “It obviously became a huge franchise, and I always give him credit for that. I didn't see it, and I didn't want to see it, but he was definitely responsible for that one.” Last year, Barton — who has gone by “Uncle Creepy” online for years — released a memoir titled “A Comedy of Tragedies.” In it, Barton discusses one of his most complicated achievements: getting the naysayers inside Dread and the wary Epic folks who'd just met them to back “Terrifier.” “But I was stupid enough to not get anything in writing. Barton is the first to admit he isn't owed much here legally, but the seasoned genre vet threw his social media reputation and industry connections he'd spent decades building behind “Terrifier.” He said he never asked Leone and Falcone for money, but helped the indie as it was starting to build word of mouth. A similar argument is being made by Corcoran's legal team, who say they've got a written deal on their client's side that entitles her to 1 percent of “Terrifier” profits across all revenue generated by the franchise. The words “cunt,” “bitch,” “slut,” and “pig” appeared carved into her bare body. An established name and face in the genre landscape when it wasn't clear if Art (now played by David Howard Thornton) could ever find a mainstream audience, Barton championed “Terrifier” loudly for several years. The first film was made on a shoestring budget of just $35,000 and funded by producer Falcone after he worked with Leone on his own directorial debut, titled “Joe's War” (2015). Leone and Falcone have since gained a reputation in the horror world as a fearsome twosome with several sources describing them as “ride or die” partners who earnestly “love” each other. “Phil is very much Damien's shield in a lot of ways,” said Barton. I always will love you guys, but mark my words, Phil is going to sink this ship. The sequels were released at Cineverse, exploding as eventized theatrical releases that made millions at the box office and firmly established Art as the first serious addition to slasher head canon since “Saw.” Depending on who you ask, Dread either couldn't stay competitive in the bidding war for “Terrifier 2” — or Leone didn't want them to. It repeatedly sold out as a Blu-ray release (marked at $19.99), and it even merited a steelbook edition (priced at $49.99), both of which bear Corcoran's image and the controversial sawing scene on the packaging. “I can't remember a single other Dread title that we needed a second [Blu-ray] order of, and we needed several for ‘Terrifier,'” said the same source, who recalled needing all hands on deck to fill physical media orders fast enough. “It's the only one that we exceeded our 1,000-order minimum — at least several times over. He used the recognizable Dread Central brand and his own media personality to introduce audiences to a new director he thought would be a lifelong friend. Speaking with IndieWire, he recalled feeling responsible for “Terrifier” viewers even as his own position in the franchise's history became less clear. “I made sure that the fan base, they weren't just on this ride with us,” Barton said. (“Terrifier 4” has not yet begun production or landed a distribution deal.) But Barton bet big by walking away from Dread Central in part because of the movie. Per Barton, he packed and shipped “Terrifier” merchandise out of his basement — while playing watchdog for bootleg products on Etsy and routinely interfacing with fans who had questions about available merchandise. He says he also negotiated major convention appearances for Art the Clown as well as inspired his inclusion in video games and at popular horror events, circles where Barton was already well known but Leone and Falcone were not. Barton was not on set for any “Terrifier” production, but his repeat appearances promoting the franchise were eventually cited by Falcone as proof he had overstated his role. Barton told IndieWire the email from Falcone “firing” him in November 2023 came as a shock. He arranged press features, celebrity-backed screenings, and completed a wide range of office PA duties Falcone and Leone might've had to hire someone to do otherwise. Never stepping foot on set, Barton says he still endeavored to support the productions in ways that mattered for the art and its bottom line. The week before he was dismissed, Barton said Leone had been showing him test footage for “Terrifier 3.” “I feel like Dr. Frankenstein being haunted by his monster, and it breaks my heart,” said Barton, who described feeling conflicted every time he sees “Terrifier” in stores or on screen. Because it harkens back to the whole, ‘What did I do wrong? I should be taking better care of my wife and kids…' thing.” By most accounts, Barton's falling out with Leone and Falcone isn't actionable and was repeatedly short-handed to IndieWire by sources on both sides as “creative differences.” He wasn't under any kind of formal contract, and, according to Barton, he wrongly assumed he would be taken care of as the franchise grew. Per their account, Barton had seriously overstepped and created a dynamic that was doomed to fail. Similar to Corcoran's complaint, that POV places the burden of asking for “Terrifier” credit on everyone but Leone and Falcone. Still, the public connection between Barton and “Terrifier” persists to this day. Even having sold off all of his favorite collectibles — partly from financial need but also out of hurt — in an event he called a “Terri-Fire Sale,” Barton says he still gets tagged endlessly in posts about the killer clown. Barton's story bears a striking resemblance to the narrative outlined in Corcoran's legal claim and suggests the franchise was enjoying demonstrable success at a time that could be critical to determining if and how much she is owed. It's also just the start of a string of similar stories, many from “Terrifier” fans like Barton who have raised the alarm on their own business deals with Leone and Falcone.
