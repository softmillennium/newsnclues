                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin closed October lower, snapping its six-year “Uptober” streak while BNB eked out a gain as a mid-month jolt left most majors stuck below early highs. The shock landed Oct. 10, when President Donald Trump threatened steep new tariffs on China amid rare-earth tensions, touching off a broad risk-off move. Bitcoin slid from roughly the low $120,000s toward about $105,000 in fast trade, and altcoins fell harder as thin liquidity met heavy leverage. On CoinGlass's Bitcoin Monthly Returns heat map, October 2025 is the first red October since 2018 and ends a green run that stretched from 2019 through 2024. The month's shape was remarkably consistent across one-month TradingView charts. Solana and XRP echoed that rhythm with a sequence of lower highs into the final sessions. In practical terms, late rebounds did not flip resistance into support, which is why the monthly candles printed red for those four. It absorbed the mid-month downdraft, carved higher lows through the final third, and closed October higher — about 4.2% — leaving a green print while peers slipped. It is a community nickname born from bitcoin's tendency to post gains in October over the past decade, reinforced by that CoinGlass grid showing every October from 2019 through 2024 in the green. Flipping the cell to red this year does not erase the historical tilt, but it does nudge risk management back to tape confirmation rather than calendar confidence. The numbers that different dashboards show can diverge for mundane reasons. Rolling 30-day readings on major trackers update continuously and often include early-October highs, so they can show a steeper decline into Nov. 1 even when the strict calendar month looks milder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EcoYield, Hyperliquid, and BlockDAG are among the top altcoins to buy now. The first one is a crypto presale rapidly gaining momentum and attracting participants with significant bonuses. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid is an established, large-cap altcoin that has defied the market's downtrend, posting substantial gains. Lastly, BlockDAG is nearing the end of its lengthy presale with a slight decline. Let's see how far Hyperliquid can surge and why EcoYield may become this year's top presale at BlockDAG's expense. Crypto is a highly volatile asset class that tends to swing between nauseating highs and depressing lows. They call it “buying the dip,” which means purchasing an asset after its price has temporarily fallen. Others say you should jump on an accelerating bandwagon and buy crypto before its price becomes unaffordable. Neither of these two strategies is successful all the time, and many other factors can decide the best time to invest in crypto. Your best choice is to enter the market only after doing your due diligence and having a good understanding of it. This way, you can discover the best crypto to buy now. With that in mind, let's see how some of the best-performing altcoins can provide a gateway to today's crypto market. EcoYield is a crypto project that gives investors exposure to real yield backed by real-world assets. The company builds physical infrastructure comprising solar-powered facilities and CPU clusters that deliver highly efficient AI compute power. EcoYield generates revenue by leasing the energy it produces to AI companies and other enterprises. This way, $EYE token buyers obtain access to real yield while also contributing to the expansion of real-world infrastructure with an eco-friendly approach. The $EYE token is currently in the first presale round, offering buyers access to staking features, governance rights, and other perks. Furthermore, EcoYield rewards participants with a 65% bonus in Yield Tokens. This token will track each investor's contribution and proportional share of revenue. EcoYield is targeting an APY of 20-30%, depending on project IRRs. These arguably make  $EYE the best crypto to buy now. Hyperliquid is a decentralized crypto exchange that offers a wide range of tradable assets and specializes in perpetual futures trading. The platform primarily caters to expert traders, offering lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and advanced trading tools. This system should help developers perform high-speed, low-cost transactions and cross-chain operations within a secure, scalable environment. The $BDAG token has been on presale for over two years, declining steadily in recent months. Many investors have passed the opportunity to onboard the project since it still doesn't have a launch date in sight. Established crypto coins like $HYPE can generate steady growth, albeit at a slow speed. Meanwhile, long-running crypto presales like BlockDAG have an even smaller chance of delivering high returns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan says Solana price could follow a path similar to Bitcoin over time. Second, Bitcoin could capture a larger share of that market as it matures. Hougan said that if the market simply doubled and Bitcoin kept its current share, its price would likely rise in line with that expansion. If Bitcoin's share climbed toward 50% similar to gold's standing, he believes the price could reach about $6.5 million per coin. He said the same logic could work for Solana. In his view, the chain now serves as a base layer for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets, areas he believes could grow many times from here. Hougan has also argued that the new US exchange-traded products could help Solana push to fresh highs. Bitwise launched its spot SOL ETF on October 28 under the ticker BSOL. Grayscale rolled out its own version the next day, listed as GSOL. Together, they now manage roughly $439 million in SOL exposure, or about 0.4% of the token's circulating supply. Data from DeFiLlama shows the network handled about 55–60 million transactions per day, a sign that users continue to move funds and interact with apps at scale. That indicates excellent liquidity levels and continued engagement within the trading ecosystem of Solana. CoinGlass data shows SOL's open interest in derivatives sitting near $9.37 billion. Spot trading over the past day reached about $690.65 million, while futures volume came in around $11.05 billion. Any test of this zone has signaled a bounce, indicating that dip-buyers are still at task and are ready to protect the level. Recent candles show higher lows through the week, a sign that buyers are stepping back in. Trading activity has also evened out after the pullback, suggesting sellers are losing their grip. The chart shows several attempts to move past this zone, but each push has been rejected. A clean break and close above that level would point to further strength. The analyst says a move through $295 opens the door toward $400, close to an earlier supply pocket around $390–$410, where price stalled earlier this year. RSI is climbing from mid-range, leaving room for price to stretch before it hits overheated levels. If the trend breaks down, support around $250–$255 could act as a safety net.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite warnings from financial experts and law enforcement agencies about volatility, scams, and lax regulatory oversight, digital currencies are now part of the financial mainstream. And a growing number of businesses now accept crypto as payment. A recent survey of cryptocurrency holders by the National Cryptocurrency Association found that most respondents (76 percent) said they trust crypto as much or more than traditional banks. But a February 2024 Pew Research Center survey found most Americans “aren't confident in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrency.” In the Pew survey, 63 percent of respondents said they had “little to no confidence that current ways to invest in, trade, or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe.” When the first exchange opened in 2010, a single Bitcoin was valued at about $0.03. While this modern-day gold rush has made people (mostly insiders) incredibly rich, many others have lost money. “Crypto isn't really an investment,” said Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, who compares buying crypto to betting on an NFL football game. There are no underlying investments or governments backing most crypto, Frayer warns. Crypto is also far more volatile than most stocks, bonds, and commodities. Daily price swings of two to four percent are typical. “Exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns, and macroeconomic conditions” can trigger sudden crashes, according to Webopedia. “Outside actors” with significant positions in a digital currency have already used “subterfuge techniques,” including fake news releases from major retailers and the SEC to influence crypto prices, said Amanda Fischer, COO of Better Markets, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in the financial markets. And while it may seem less risky to buy exchange-traded crypto funds (ETFs) through a bank or brokerage firm, the underlying crypto assets remain unregulated, she warns. Her advice: “Treat any cryptocurrency investment like you would any sort of budget for sports betting or gambling; only put up what you can afford to lose.” Fisher and Frayer were guests on a recent episode of Checkbook's Consumerpedia podcast. Since 2014, at least 10 major crypto exchange hacks that stole more than $100 million each have been documented, according to Crystal Intelligence. The hackers use online services called “mixers” or “tumblers,” that quickly launder digital currency by erasing its internet history, she explained. In August, he signed an executive order that expanded investment options for employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plans to include cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate. Financial advisor Tom Cock, a partner at Apella Wealth and co-host of the Talking Real Money podcast, urges clients and listeners not to consider crypto as an investment. The IRS treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, not currency. Transactions involving bitcoin are subject to capital gains tax, like stocks and real estate. Crypto holdings and transactions must be reported on your income tax form each year. The IRS treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, not currency. Transactions involving bitcoin are subject to capital gains tax, like stocks and real estate. Crypto holdings and transactions must be reported on your income tax form each year. Stablecoins got a boost in July when President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) into law, the first cryptocurrency legislation ever passed by Congress. It establishes federal rules and guidelines for companies offering stablecoins, including the requirement that they maintain 100 percent reserve backing with “liquid assets,” such as U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries. Critics of the GENIUS Act, including the nonprofit vericans for Financial Reform, claim it will dismantle federal safeguards, create “windfalls for crypto tycoons,” and allow big tech companies to “further entrench their monopoly power.” Mainstream financial players are racing to expand their crypto offerings. Mastercard recently announced that its cardholders can use stablecoins to make purchases at more than 150 million merchants worldwide. The company said it is “expanding” how more than 3.5 billion Mastercard cards in circulation can securely engage with crypto.” Visa boasts on its website that it is working with “more than 70 of the leading crypto platforms” to issue crypto-linked cards that “make it simple and convenient to convert and spend crypto.” Crypto has become the currency of choice for criminals running romance scams, investment schemes, and government or bank impersonation cons. Instead of telling their victims to buy gift cards at a local store (a still-common tactic), many fraudsters now direct them to nearby Bitcoin ATMs, where they can turn cash into crypto. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports that scams involving Bitcoin ATMS “have surged dramatically” in recent years. The FTC calls these crypto ATMs “payment portals for scammers.” “Our familiarity with traditional ATMs is a big reason why scammers are getting their victims to send money via cryptocurrency kiosks,” said John Breyault, who manages the National Consumers League's Fraud.org website. If you've fallen for a crypto scam, contact the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Checkbook.org is a nonprofit organization that helps consumers get good service and low prices. It does this by providing unbiased ratings, advice, and price information. Checkbook is supported by consumers and takes no money from the service providers it evaluates.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto isn't the domain of early adopters and philosophically driven “hodlers” anymore. In Q3 2025, Tether's USDt USDTUSD and Circle's USDC USDCUSD collectively accounted for approximately 40% of the total crypto volume. This gargantuan figure is due, in part, to folks from emerging regions like Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America wanting a better way to move their money. Their reasons for diving into crypto are practical and straightforward. Not so long ago, getting into crypto meant buying Bitcoin BTCUSD, maybe reading a white paper or two, and finding out — sometimes, the hard way — about seed phrases, personal wallets and the perils of self-custody. Today, most people outside the crypto enthusiast circles aren't thinking about ideological freedom or permissionless money. Stablecoins are dominating this pattern, becoming the first crypto asset many people encounter, especially in places where banks are slow, expensive or unreliable. Citizens need to send money across borders cheaply, quickly and without banking hurdles. Centralized exchanges and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms are now experiencing a surge in traffic from users who value cryptocurrency for its utility rather than ideological reasons. It's not just anecdotal: Chainalysis' 2025 Global Adoption Index shows that India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Brazil and the Philippines are leading in grassroots crypto activity, much of which is routed through non-volatile assets, like stablecoins. Cross-border remittances make up a multibillion-dollar portion of the crypto ecosystem annually. Crypto adoption among Filipinos, in particular, has increased to 22.5%, up from 17.8% last year, primarily driven by play-to-earn gaming and remittance needs. Other fast-growing markets, including Nigeria and Vietnam, are also experiencing similar trends. Practicality and necessity are driving people to crypto, rather than the prospect of freedom, money or other philosophical motivations. There is, however, a tradeoff lurking in the wings. They're far more likely to rely on wallets provided by exchanges or custodians. While these solutions may be more straightforward and familiar, they run counter to the original ethos of crypto: not your keys, not your coins. For businesses and platforms, the lesson is clear: If most new users lack the desire or time to master seed phrases and backup protocols, crypto security needs to be built natively into the product, not bolted on as an afterthought. Companies are experimenting with abstracting away seed phrases, using multi-layered account recovery, trusted contacts or even hardware integrations to safeguard assets without exposing users to the complexities of cryptocurrency's cryptography. Abstracting away complexity is key to the next wave of adoption This new wave of crypto users isn't waiting for the perfect UX. Many Filipinos are already engaging in P2P cash exchanges to convert their digital assets back into fiat currency. Crypto's convenience and speed are embedded in the daily lives of millions, enabling them to send money, make purchases on Facebook Marketplace, settle family bills and manage side hustles in gaming economies.​ Crypto technology's next big win won't be about championing ideological arguments; it will be about quietly powering global money movement and commerce, native in everyday apps, as frictionless as sending a WhatsApp message. Some of the world's largest businesses, from remittance processors to mobile money providers, are integrating blockchain rails, creating experiences where users never see a wallet address or a blockchain explorer but instead enjoy faster settlement and lower fees.​ Firstly, products must make security seamless and not a burden for the user to bear. Custodial wallets, social recovery, multifactor authentication and even regulated, insured custody options are all part of the toolkit. It must deliver best-in-class UX, clear safeguards and effective recovery options. Secondly, it means welcoming a new global crypto population: not just the cypherpunks and maximalists, but people who rely on utility, trust and practical empowerment. The cryptocurrency industry is poised for a much broader transformation. Crypto's future depends on recognizing the changing face of adoption. Opinion by: Louise Ivan, co-founder and CEO of Ryder.

Özer had been serving one of the longest prison sentences ever handed down in Turkey. Thodex was one of Turkey's largest cryptocurrency exchanges during the country's digital currency boom. Özer claimed that Thodex had been targeted by a cyberattack and said the suspension was temporary. Turkish prosecutors later accused him of fleeing with about $2 billion in investors' assets, though the total losses were never officially confirmed. At Turkey's request INTERPOL issued a Red Notice for Özer shortly after his disappearance. Following a lengthy extradition process, he was returned to Turkey in April 2023 and detained upon arrival at İstanbul Airport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 crypto renaissance has ignited unprecedented interest in presale investments, where visionary projects offer life-changing wealth potential before mainstream exposure. Among the contenders capturing investor attention, Based Eggman ($GGs) has rapidly outpaced its most vocal competitor Blockchain FX ($BFX), establishing itself as the definitive best crypto presale for those seeking exponential growth. While Blockchain FX positions itself as a multi-asset trading infrastructure play, its conventional approach fails to harness the cultural momentum that historically transforms presales into generational opportunities—a phenomenon where Based Eggman's meticulously engineered tokenomics, community-driven utility, and meme-powered ecosystem shine with undeniable superiority. Based Eggman Presale masterfully replicates the DNA of crypto's most transformative early investments. This mirrors Axie Infinity's presale blueprint where $AXS token value surged 1,200% in six months because gameplay mechanics inherently destroyed tokens faster than new issuance. Most critically, Based Eggman launches with fully operational utility: players can immediately deploy $GGs in its Eggman-themed strategy game, compete in streaming tournaments with real token rewards, and trade character NFTs—all while Blockchain FX remains confined to whitepaper promises. Blockchain FX's roadmap requires navigating complex regulatory minefields across multiple asset classes—a process that historically delays value realization by 18-24 months. Based Eggman leverages Base Blockchain's Coinbase integration for instant mainstream accessibility, bypassing regulatory hurdles while tapping into 100 million potential users. While Blockchain FX targets professional traders with complex financial instruments, Based Eggman speaks the universal language of memes and gaming—engaging the demographic that fueled Bitcoin's 2017 surge and Ethereum's 2020 explosion. Critically, Blockchain FX's large supply model faces relentless sell pressure from institutional unlocks, whereas Based Eggman's 60% presale allocation to retail investors creates a loyal community that actively defends the token through ecosystem participation rather than passive holding. Based Eggman Presale replicates the exact conditions that generated generational wealth in prior cycles: finite supply creating artificial scarcity, deflationary mechanics tied to real-world usage, cultural magnetism for viral growth, and immediate utility that rewards early adopters. Where Blockchain FX Presale offers a promising but conventional infrastructure play, Based Eggman delivers the emotional resonance and economic design that historically turns $500 investments into life-changing sums within months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The debate pitting Ethereum versus Solana as rival L1s misses how radically their architectures diverged in 2025. Ethereum evolved into a settlement layer for modular rollups, while Solana doubled down on monolithic throughput. Solana made the opposite bet, with one unified ledger, sub-second slot times, and a proof-of-history pipeline that sequences transactions in a single global ledger. Both paths deliver transactions that feel instant to users clicking “send,” but the security models diverge sharply once you ask what happens in the seconds, minutes, or days after that click. It's about which model delivers lower friction for the application they want to build, and how much they're willing to pay, in terms of latency, complexity, or exit time, for the assurances each system provides. Solana's architecture collapses inclusion, confirmation, and economic finality into a single 400-millisecond slot when the network runs smoothly. Validators vote on blocks using a proof-of-history clock that timestamps transactions before consensus, allowing the network to pipeline throughput without waiting for traditional BFT round-trips. Users see confirmation streams after two-thirds of stake votes on the block, typically within half a second, and complete finality arrives around 12 seconds later. Jakob Povšič, co-founder of Temporal, described the user-facing result in a note: “For most end users, a transaction is considered ‘confirmed' once two-thirds of the network have voted on its block, which takes less than half a second.” Optimistic rollups impose seven-day challenge periods before users can withdraw to mainnet, while ZK rollups compress that to 15 minutes or a few hours by submitting validity proofs. Will Papper, co-founder of Syndicate, argued the delay matters less than it appears. “Many instant bridges feel comfortable operating on non-finalized rollup states anyway. L2s deliver sub-second inclusion for apps that rarely bridge to L1, but applications requiring frequent mainnet settlement pay a time cost Solana avoids.” The architecture difference reshapes how each system handles congestion, fees, and failure. On Solana, the base fee remains fixed at 5,000 lamports per signature, roughly $0.0001, while priority fees allow users to bid for inclusion during traffic spikes. Still, the introduction of Dencun's blob in March 2024 and Pectra's capacity increases in May 2025 drove typical “send” transactions to single-digit cents on major rollups. The failure modes differ: an L2 sequencer going offline pauses user activity on that rollup even when Ethereum L1 operates normally. Fault proofs and force-inclusion mechanisms provide escape hatches, but UX during an outage depends on whether the affected rollup has implemented those backstops. The seven-day optimistic rollup withdrawal window exists because fraud proofs require time for validators to submit challenges if execution was incorrect. Third-party bridges mitigate the delay by lending liquidity, allowing users to experience near-instant exits for a small fee. ZK rollups eliminate the challenge period by submitting validity proofs, allowing withdrawals in minutes to hours. Solana has no withdrawal window because transactions settle directly on L1. That simplicity removes a layer of bridging trust but concentrates all failure risk in the validator client and network stack. MEV extraction on Solana flows through Jito's block engine, which validators integrate to auction bundle space. Stake-weighted quality of service (QoS) provides preferential treatment to high-stakes validators, thereby improving predictability for searchers but raising questions about fairness for smaller participants. Ethereum's trajectory aims to harden inclusion guarantees at the protocol level. The 2026 “Glamsterdam” upgrade plans to enshrine proposer-builder separation and introduce inclusion lists that force proposers to include specified transactions within one or two slots. Papper argued that inclusion guarantees matter more than single-slot finality: Solana's catalyst is Firedancer, the independent validator client developed by Jump Crypto. Public demos showcased throughput far exceeding that of the current Agave client. Glamsterdam in 2026 brings enshrined PBS and inclusion lists, hardening censorship resistance. OP Stack chains and Arbitrum are maturing fault-proof systems that enable permissionless validation. Papper predicted that cheaper data availability (DA) drives the most immediate gains: Solana's single-slot path, stake-weighted QoS, and Jito bundles deliver that when milliseconds matter. “We've come a long way…from an NFT mint almost bringing down the chain in late 2021 to Solana surviving the recent Black Friday without breaking a sweat.” On-chain games and social applications that rarely settle on L1 fit L2s well. Arbitrum's 250-millisecond blocks feel instant, and post-Dencun fees compete with Solana's sub-penny economics. “I think that 200ms from preconfirmations is already imperceptible to most users.” If users rarely bridge to L1, L2 UX competes directly with Solana. You don't have to deal with bridging or the extra complexity of data availability.” Meanwhile, Ethereum bets that separating concerns, L1 for settlement, L2s for execution, allows each layer to specialize and scale independently, with cheaper blobs and mature fault proofs narrowing the UX gap. Both ecosystems optimized different parts of that curve in 2025, and the 2026 upgrades will test whether monolithic throughput or modular scaling delivers the better product at scale.
