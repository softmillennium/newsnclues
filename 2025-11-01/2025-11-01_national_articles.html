Derek Jeter, David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez reacted to a wild Game 6 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays and previewed World Series Game 7. MLB created a rule for Ohtani, Rule 5.11(b), that put the Dodgers in a peculiar situation ahead of Saturday's matchup, which will air exclusively on FOX at 8 p.m. MLB instituted a rule that if a starting pitcher was in the batting lineup, he could continue hitting despite being taken off the mound — a rule that allows Ohtani to stay in the game upon being removed as a starter. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani walks to the dugout against the Toronto Blue Jays during the fifth inning in Game 4 of baseball's World Series. The game was played in Los Angeles, California, on Oct. 28, 2025. However, if Ohtani started the game as the team's designated hitter and later entered in relief, they would risk losing his powerful bat in the lineup upon his exit as a pitcher. The only way Ohtani could remain in the game after being used as a relief pitcher would be to play the field, something he has not done often in his career. The three-time MVP has played the field just 8 1/3 innings in his career and has not done so since 2021. Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani (17) celebrates after hitting a single against the Toronto Blue Jays in the eighth inning during Game 2 of the 2025 MLB World Series. The game was played at Rogers Centre in Toronto, Canada. With all of that in mind, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts will start Ohtani on the mound, ensuring they can keep his bat in the game regardless of how long he pitches. It is not clear how deep Ohtani will pitch into the game, as he is on three days' rest.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks after signing an agreement with the Webequie First Nation at Queen's Park in Toronto on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. President Donald Trump greets Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney during a summit to support ending the more than two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza after a breakthrough ceasefire deal, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario's premier not to run an anti-tariff advertisement that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada. Ontario's television advertisement that aired in in the U.S. criticizes Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The ad upset Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%. When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, “Well, you saw what came of it. It's not something I would have done.” As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a U.S. governor. A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against them. Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Carney met with Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Carney said Canada has to transform away from reliance on a single trade partner. He said his next move will be the federal budget on Nov. 4 when he will introduce measures to protect and diversify the economy. “We can spend our time watching Truth Social,” Carney said.</p>

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces hit an important fuel pipeline in the Moscow region that supplies the Russian army, Ukraine's military intelligence said Saturday, as Russia kept up a sustained campaign of massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The agency, which is known by its acronym HUR, described it as a “serious blow” to Russia's military logistics. The operation, which targeted infrastructure near Ramensky district, destroyed all three fuel lines, HUR said. “Our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,” said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR, referring to international sanctions on Russia imposed over its all-out war and the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces defeated a team of Ukrainian special forces that were rushed to the eastern front-line hot spot of Pokrovsk in a bid to stop Russian troops from pushing farther into the city. The videos show the men, one dressed in fatigues and the other in a dark green jacket, sat against a peeling wall in a dark room, as they speak of fierce fighting and encirclement by Russian forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed last week that his forces had encircled the city's Ukrainian defenders. But Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that while the situation in Pokrovsk remains “hardest” for Ukrainian forces, who are trying to push Russian troops out of the city, there is no encirclement or blockade as Moscow has maintained. “A comprehensive operation to destroy and push out enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing. Zelenskyy said that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Donetsk in a major push to capture the city and claim a major battlefield victory. Putin is trying to persuade the United States, which wants him to seek a peace deal, that Ukraine can't hold out against Russian military superiority. Kyiv still controls about a 10th of the coal-rich region. Elsewhere, a civilian died and 19 more were wounded, including a 9-year-old girl, when Russia struck the southern Mykolaiv region with an Iskander ballistic missile on Saturday morning, local official Vitaliy Kim said. The strikes came as Russia pressed large drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, bringing power outages and restrictions across the country earlier this week in what Kyiv described as a “systematic energy terror.” Moscow launched 223 drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, 206 of which were shot down, according to the Ukrainian air force. Seventeen struck targets in seven Ukrainian regions, the air force said, without providing details. Russia also hit an agricultural enterprise in Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, injuring a 66-year old woman, according to a Telegram update by regional government official Viacheslav Chaus. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but local authorities reported a rare large-scale power outage in a Russian city of over 100,000 people. The municipal administration of Zhukovsky, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Moscow, in a Telegram update blamed the blackout on an “automatic equipment shutdown.” Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Two hundred twenty-eight days after the start of the MLB season, it will all come down to one final game. The Los Angeles Dodgers staved off elimination in miraculous fashion Friday night with an unorthodox double play on a fly ball to left, forcing a Game 7 against the Toronto Blue Jays in Canada on Saturday night, live only on FOX. For the Blue Jays, their decision on a Game 7 starter is a no-brainer, as Max Scherzer is on regular rest and has been pitching much better as of late. For the Dodgers, they have a peculiar situation on their hands. Saturday would have been normal rest for Tyler Glasnow, but he was summoned to get the final three outs Friday. It only took three pitches, so perhaps he's good to go. However, there is a catch with Shohei Ohtani. After Game 6, Roberts said everyone but Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who tossed six innings Friday, was available. Obviously, that includes Ohtani, whose 10-strikeout performance — while hitting three home runs — sent the Dodgers to the Fall Classic. "Everyone" also includes Glasnow, who was hardly worked to preserve the save. But due to a quirk in MLB rule, 5.11(b) that essentially was made specifically for Ohtani, he may have no choice but to start. MLB instituted a rule that if a starting pitcher was in the batting lineup, he could continue hitting despite being taken off the mound. However, that is not the case for relievers. So if Ohtani were to only DH on Saturday, then pitch in relief, they would risk losing Ohtani for the remainder of the game upon his being taken off the mound. In order to keep his bat, he would have to play the field, which he has not done since 2021 — he has just 8.1 innings on the field in his career, all in that season. Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani celebrates as he runs the bases for his solo home run during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park, Tuesday, April 23, 2024, in Washington. As for Toronto, its bullpen appears to be locked and loaded. Kevin Gausman gave the team six innings in a tough-luck loss, and Louis Varland, Mason Fluharty and Seranthony Domínguez combined for just two innings before Chris Bassitt came in for the ninth. But Vladimir Guerrero Jr. continued a postseason performance that will be one for the record books, win or loss. He is one hit away from tying Randy Arozarena's record from 2020 for the most hits in a single postseason (his teammate, Ernie Clement, is third). Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. returns to the dugout following eighth-inning baseball game action against the Baltimore Orioles in Toronto, Sunday, March 30, 2025. As for Toronto, a win would mark their first title since 1993, when Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run. Fans certainly felt déjà vu incoming in the bottom of the ninth Friday night, but they have to wait at least one more day.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss the peanut allergy study and his new book, 'The Miracles Among Us.' Early peanut introduction could help to curb allergies in kids, new research suggests. Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old — instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics — appears to be making a dent in the number of peanut allergy diagnoses, the study published in Pediatrics suggests. "New onset peanut allergy dropped by 43% in kids under 3," Dr. David Hill, M.D., Ph.D., from the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told Fox News Digital. These reactions happen when the body's immune system overreacts to peanuts by producing a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which can lead to anaphylaxis — a severe, sometimes life-threatening allergic response, the researchers noted in a news release. These symptoms can be immediate and life-threatening, experts told Fox News Digital. Beyond peanuts, other common food allergens include milk, egg and wheat, according to the report. Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%. Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old — instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics — appears to be reducing the number of peanut allergy diagnoses. Based on the LEAP trial, leading organizations in pediatric allergy and immunology revised their guidelines for clinical practice in 2015 and 2017, allowing early exposure to peanuts for high-risk children. "It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy." The guidelines were updated again in 2021, encouraging the introduction of peanut, egg and other major food allergens as early as 4 to 6 months for all children — including those without a history of prior reaction, according to health experts. "It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy, so if we introduced the foods during that window, you will prevent food allergy," Dr. Susan Schuval, chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in New York, told Fox News Digital. "If you wait until after that window, the child will be more predisposed to having a food allergy," added Schuval, who was not part of the study. They analyzed electronic health records from multiple clinics in several states to determine whether the policy changes were having an effect. For at least two years after the 2015 guidance, the study found that there was a 27% decrease in peanut allergies and a 38% decrease in food allergies. "Everyone has been wondering whether these landmark public health interventions have had an impact on reducing rates of IgE-mediated food allergies in the United States," said first author Stanislaw Gabryszewski, M.D., Ph.D., an attending physician in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "We now have data that suggest the effect of this landmark public health intervention is occurring," she added. After the 2017 guidance change, peanut allergies dipped by 43% and overall food allergies decreased by 36% (compared to the pre-2015 guidance) among children observed for at least a year. Hill told Fox News Digital he's "hopeful that our findings will help to spread awareness that early allergen introduction is safe and effective." While early exposure may not completely eliminate allergies to peanuts and other foods, the drop in rates of food allergy diagnoses is promising, said the researchers. They also emphasized the importance of consistent early introduction in clinical practice settings. Not all parents may be comfortable with these revised guidelines, health experts told Fox News Digital. Parents are encouraged to discuss any concerns with their pediatrician before introducing potential food allergens. "Not everyone has followed those guidelines, but this is further evidence that this early introduction is effective at preventing food allergies," Schuval said. Parents are encouraged to discuss any concerns with their pediatrician before introducing potential food allergens. Future studies are needed to investigate how timing, dosage and frequency of exposure could further protect against food allergies, Hill added.

Fox News Digital spoke with federal defense attorney Ronald Chapman II about the high-profile New York strip club bribery and tax fraud case, where executives are accused of plying a state tax auditor with cash, Florida trips and lap dances. A group of strip club executives allegedly bribed a New York state tax auditor with cash, luxury Florida trips and lap dances worth thousands of dollars a day to slash millions from their tax bills, according to a sweeping indictment by Attorney General Letitia James. The 79-count indictment accuses top leaders of RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc., the Texas-based parent company behind strip clubs Rick's Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret and Hoops Cabaret, of using their venues to disguise bribes as "promotional" expenses and avoid more than $8 million in sales taxes between 2010 and 2024. Prosecutors say the auditor received at least 13 all-expenses-paid trips to Florida, where the company's top leadership was allegedly given hotel rooms, restaurant meals and up to $5,000 per day for private dances at RCI-owned clubs. A woman performs at the "2001 Odyssey" strip club on August 25, 2012 in Tampa, Florida. Federal defense attorney Ronald Chapman II said the allegations, while "sensational," may not prove criminal intent once tested in court. "When you look a little deeper, things start to look a little bit different," Chapman told Fox News Digital. "This case reminds me of the [President] Trump financial-fraud case, where prosecutors in New York built a sweeping narrative around business judgments that may not actually violate the law." Chapman said prosecutors face an uphill battle to prove a quid pro quo and that the auditor's decisions were directly influenced by the perks. "It only turns into bribery when that is also done consistent with bad conduct, looking the other way on something," he said. "I just don't see that other side of the quid pro quo yet." "We see, once again, a very late indictment being brought. That means somebody brought this case from a pile of cases and decided to pluck it out," he said. "Oftentimes we will see prosecutors right around the time they're about to be facing re-election, trying to bring big cases like this with sensational headlines where they don't really have the goods to fully handle the prosecution," he said. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offices in New York will shutter in response to Attorney General Letitia James' alleged "corrupt" business practices, Fox News Digital learned. James is facing one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. Prosecutors say James misrepresented the property as a secondary residence on loan/mortgage documents, when in fact they allege she used it as a rental investment property, which qualified her for more favorable loan terms. (John Roca/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images) The indictment, filed in New York County Supreme Court, names RCI Chief Executive Officer Eric Langan, Controller Timothy Winata, Chief Financial Officer Bradley Chhay, Operations Director Ahmed "Ed" Anakar, and Nightclub Operations Director Shaun Kevlin as defendants. A sixth individual has also been charged but was not identified because of the sealed indictment. If convicted of the top counts, Langan, Winata and Anakar could each face up to 25 years in prison, while Chhay and Kevlin could face a maximum of 15 years. James described the case as a blatant abuse of power by a publicly traded company seeking to skirt its tax obligations. "RCI's executives shamelessly used their strip clubs to bribe their way out of paying millions of dollars in taxes," James said in a statement announcing the indictment. "I will always take action to fight corruption and ensure everyone pays their fair share." You can follow her on Twitter and LinkedIn.

This image from video provided by Nikki Ramirez-Smith shows people being processed by law enforcement agents during a raid at La Catedral Arena horse race track in Wilder, Idaho, on Oct. 19, 2025. This combination of photos provided by Anabel Romero shows bruises on the wrist, left, and torso of her 14-year-old daughter in Meridian, Idaho, on Oct. 20, 2025, a day after she was detained by law enforcement agents during a raid on a horse race track. This image from video provided by Nikki Ramirez-Smith shows officers from various law enforcement agencies during a raid at La Catedral Arena horse race track in Wilder, Idaho, on Oct. 19, 2025. La Catedral Arena horse race track in Wilder, Idaho is seen on Oct. 22, 2025, three days after the FBI and other law enforcement agencies raided the property as part of a gambling investigation. Romero and her daughter, both U.S. citizens, were among about 400 people detained for hours at a privately owned race track about an hour west of Boise as part an FBI-led investigation into illegal gambling that resulted in more than 100 arrests, nearly all for immigration violations. Romero isn't sure what agency the officers who zip-tied her daughter were from. More than 200 officers from at least 14 agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol, as well as local police, participated in the raid at La Catedral Arena. It also shows how immigration dragnets marked by a heavy use of force have entangled U.S. citizens and legal residents. Several children were separated from family members for hours. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees Border Patrol and ICE, denied that children were zip-tied. Four people at the track, and a fifth the next day, were arrested on gambling charges, while 105 others were detained on immigration violations. John Carter, a track security guard, said he was placed in zip ties and lost circulation in his hands before an FBI agent loosened them. Carter said officers used flash-bang devices, pointed guns at people, and deployed a pepper bomb in a vehicle where someone tried to hide. Just because there's 10 people in a crowd doing something illegal, that doesn't make everyone in that crowd illegal,” Carter said. FBI Special Agent Jacob Sheridan said in court documents that the people charged worked on a pari-mutuel betting operation, although the track did not have a state license for that, only for horse racing. Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokeswoman, said, “ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation.” However, court documents make no mention of animal fighting. She later added that ICE did not restrain or arrest children. Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said in a joint statement that it was “completely false” and “deeply misleading” for ICE to take credit, noting the FBI's leadership and the involvement of a local task force. During Trump's law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., touted as focusing on crime, about 40% of the first 2,300 arrests were immigration-related. During the Idaho operation, many officers did not appear to have any identifying marks or department names on their uniforms. State and local agencies either denied restraining children or did not return calls seeking comment. Several people told the AP that ICE officers removed their restraints once they were put in line for immigration processing, and court documents say ICE was brought in after the initial search warrant was executed. Romero said that when she was unnerved about being separated from her children for hours, an agent laughed and said, “We're taking better care of them.” Several days later, Romero said her daughter's bruises were still visible. When the family drove past a police cruiser, her youngest “freaked out.” “They don't even see law enforcement anymore with respect,” she said. Her parents started to drive away, and an officer shot at their car. We were thinking that it was actual bullets,” Perez said. Her parents stopped their car, and officers shattered a window. Glass covered her brother — some went into his mouth, Perez said. “They can't really get much sleep at night. This is the first birthday he's spending without his dad.” When an officer zip-tied Jasim Duran-Villa's 11- and 15-year-old brothers, she urged him to double-check with his superiors. The officer told her other children had been restrained. “Already like 2 1/2 hours had passed, and that's why I was asking so many times, ‘Can I go get my diaper bag to get my baby some milk?' They kept ignoring me, or saying to ask another officer,” she said. After more than three hours, they were identified as citizens and allowed to leave. Duran-Villa's father was arrested and charged with an immigration violation. “They would just tell him, ‘You need to hold your mom's shirt.' When he would go a little away from me, they would push him back to me and say, ‘Keep him with you! She was eventually allowed to leave, and ICE arrested her father.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The father of presidential hopeful Gavin Newsom, William's job was to manage the Gordon P. Getty family trust fund valued at billions of dollars. Gavin Newsom would later attend Santa Clara University. Of course, opening a business in wine country can be extremely costly, but fortunately for Newsom, he was seen as a family member to Gordon Getty, who promptly invested not just in the winery but also in 10 of the 11 businesses the future governor would open while still in his mid-twenties. In other words, Gavin Newsom is a man of immense privilege. But that story will not fly in a Democratic primary for president, because this is a party now built primarily on grievance and victimhood. Newsom knows he has to pivot to appeal to the far Left, just as other privileged children, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani, have in portraying themselves as disadvantaged and oppressed. And boy, did he ever during a podcast called All The Smoke, which is hosted by former NBA players this week. “It was also about paying the bills, man. It was just like hustlin' and so I was out there, kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed,” he said with an accent that appeared to be pandering to his Black hosts. Then this sh***y student, head down, started throwing. I started making a few free throws, practicing 500 of them every night in high school.” But according to a report in The Press Democrat, Newsom “spent part of his childhood years in a two-story house with magnificent views of San Francisco. It is currently listed at $3.6 million.” How can that be? And you'll never guess who was featured in a 1991 article by the San Francisco Chronicle titled, “Children of the Rich” … Gavin Christopher Newsom. Gavin went to live with his mother, Tessa, in the aforementioned house above. He played sports in high school, which, from experience, doesn't allow for much time to work, or, in Snoop Gov's words, “hustlin'.” And if Newsom grew up poor in the heart of San Francisco with magnificent views from his home, why exactly did Gordon Getty swoop in right after college graduation to invest in a winery and nine other businesses? According to polls, Newsom is polling at or near the top for the Democratic nomination for president, along with AOC and Pete Buttigieg. But this flies in the face of what he told the late Charlie Kirk earlier this year about transgender men competing against biological women in sports. “I am not wrestling with the fairness issue. “Democrats are losing,” he added regarding their stances on cultural issues. Kirk would later write in a Fox News opinion piece that Newsom is a force to be reckoned with, only because of his unrelenting desire to be president. He is betting that voters will simply forget about Newsom's actual actions, or lack thereof, which include his refusal to reverse California's existing policy on men competing in women's sports. In July, Trump's DOJ announced it was suing California as a result. “Unsurprisingly, Newsom is charming and friendly in person. You don't become governor of 40 million people without having some charisma,” Kirk noted. “But there's clearly a layer beneath the charm. I saw that Newsom wants to be president more than any living person (and possibly every dead person, too).” New York City's mayoral race is a prime example, with a Communist likely becoming the leader of the world's financial capital. Speaking of hypocrisy, this isn't anything new for Newsom, either. No one in the country was more draconian with mask mandates and business closures than California. But there was a maskless, unvaccinated Newsom at the ritzy French Laundry, a long way from the poor Wonder Bread days, in wine country during 2020, laughing it up with other rich folks as businesses went bankrupt and children became depressed from being isolated from their classmates. And who could forget the Super Bowl in February 2022, when a maskless Newsom was taking photos with celebrities at the indoor stadium while Newsom was STILL imposing a mask mandate at all California public schools. He has as good a shot as any, although privileged, rich white guys may not ultimately fly with the current Democratic Party. But if that does happen, ask yourself this: He has the same problem as former Vice President Kamala Harris. And if Democrats actually do nominate Newsom, let's just say the bet here is that his lifelong dream of being Celebrity-in-Chief at 1600 will not be realized.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s. A potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel. FBI says it thwarted a potential terror attack Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Patel wrote on X the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.” An attorney who said he is representing one of the adults in custody urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, attorney Amir Makled said. “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty' event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said. “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed. The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said. It's not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed. Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we're told is ‘pumpkin day' – a possible reference to Halloween.” The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added. There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said. In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said. She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police. CNN's Hannah Rabinowitz, Nicki Brown and Hanna Park contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Washington, senators left town for the weekend deadlocked and more frustrated than ever, while critical safety net programs could soon lose federal funding for the first time. Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be a partial and short-term fix. Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work. And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run. “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you're going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they've depended on now is gone, because we can't even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill. Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources. And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal. “There's going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats. So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.” Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats' biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills. “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they're not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump. As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts. “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?' “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won't do what's best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats. That includes Trump's resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators. Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders' offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I'm not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.” White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won't be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government. “Let them open up the country, and we'll meet,” Trump said Friday. Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option. In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it's also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.” Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won't last much beyond Tuesday's elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp. Democrats, meanwhile, insist it's Trump who needs to offer them one. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland's ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up. The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn't know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests. Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom Trump appointed during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order. Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m. Supreme Court wants more time and information before deciding if Trump can send National Guard to Chicago Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn't vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day. Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.” “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said. Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified. “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men? '” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about Trump's claim that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.” A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland's ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment. “You don't know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf. “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied. Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense's office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump. Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs. Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements. Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said. While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon's attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled. The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility. The tense June 14 protest resulted in a riot declaration by Portland police, and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey. During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began. There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening. R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C. He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object. Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said. Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city's sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility. Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland's participation with agencies using such munitions. “We simply didn't see that (as necessary),” Schoening said. That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.” That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning. The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response. “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court. Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.</p>

Los Angeles Dodgers' Mookie Betts leaps into the arms of Kiké Hernández (8) after Toronto Blue Jays' Addison Barger, right, was forced out to end Game 6 of baseball's World Series, Friday, Oct. 31, 2025, in Toronto. TORONTO (AP) — A two-run lead was starting to slip away from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ninth inning — along with their chance to force the World Series to Game 7. And then Kiké Hernández turned what might have been a tying, two-run single by Andrés Giménez into the first game-ending left field-to-second base double play in postseason history. Max Scherzer will start Game 7 for Toronto against a Dodgers pitcher still to be determined — perhaps two-way star Shohei Ohtani, perhaps Tyler Glasnow. “It's the two best words in sports: Game 7,” Toronto manager John Schneider said. Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week by allowing one run in six innings, and slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third against Kevin Gausman that included Will Smith's go-ahead double. George Springer, back after missing two games with a sore right side, hit an RBI single in the bottom half, and the Dodgers held that 3-1 lead going to the ninth. Roki Sasaki hit Alejandro Kirk on the left wrist with an 0-2 splitter leading off and Addison Barger followed with a drive that landed at the base of the left-center wall. In a seldom-seen rarity, the ball lodged there instead of caroming back into play. Both runners crossed the plate as many in the Rogers Centre crowd initially thought Toronto had tied the game, but the rule book is clear that a ball lodged in a fence is a ground-rule double. The runners were placed at second and third, and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts brought in Glasnow, who was lined up to start Game 7 on normal rest. “I just felt that Roki wasn't as sharp, and I just felt we needed some swing-and-miss and Glasnow was the guy. So I had him loose, kind of looming,” Roberts said. Ernie Clement popped up his initial offering to first base. Hernández said he decided to play more shallow than the Dodgers' scouting card called for. He ran 52 feet and while on the run made a catch that had only a 40% probability, then delivered a one-hop throw to second baseman Miguel Rojas that doubled up Barger. And I was just like, not the right time to stop to see where the ball is, just keep going. “It's going to hit me in the face — but I'm not stopping,” Hernández remembered thinking. Barger had gotten about halfway to third before scrambling back, and he reached second base too late with his headfirst slide. “I was being too aggressive, trying to score, try to tie that game if that ball drops,” Barger said. Rojas had been inserted into the lineup for his first start since Oct. 6 in an effort by Roberts to spark the Dodgers' offense, which is batting .191 after winning with just four hits. Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. Rookie reliever Justin Wrobleski struck out Giménez to strand a runner at second in the seventh and Sasaki got out of a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth when Bo Bichette fouled out and Daulton Varsho grounded out. Then came the first game-ending double play in World Series history in which an outfielder had a putout or assist, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. With Los Angeles seeking its third title in six seasons, Roberts dropped the slumping Betts from second to third in the batting order in Game 5 and then to fourth in Game 6 — the lowest Betts had hit since 2017. Betts fell behind 1-2 in the count, fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman's third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. “He could hit me seventh, I don't care. I just want to win,” said Betts, already a three-time champion. Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, '67, '68), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and '58). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A small company in Vermont that specializes in women's cycling apparel is at the center of the fight over President Donald Trump's contentious tariff policy.

Hannah Bowerman, a technical designer for Terry Precision Cycling, measures a pair of bike shorts at the company's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — From the moment President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly every country, Nik Holm feared the company he leads might not survive. But Holm, the company president, wasn't sure how his operation could pay the tariffs first announced in April and stay in business. Terry Precision Cycling's offices are tucked behind a Burlington, Vermont, coffee shop on a leafy street that bursts into color in the fall. Local accolades share wall space with bike saddles and a color wheel's worth of fabric samples. But Terry Precision Cycling is one of a handful of small businesses that are challenging many of Trump's tariffs Wednesday before the Supreme Court in a case with extraordinary implications for the boundaries of presidential power and for the global economy. It sells cycling shorts manufactured in the U.S. using materials imported from France, Guatemala and Italy. Its distinctive, colorfully printed bike jerseys are made with high-tech material that can't be found outside of China. Tariffs mean the company has to pay more for all those imports, and without the cash reserves of a big company, it has few choices to make up the shortfall besides raising prices for customers. The bewildering pace of changes in tariffs, especially on goods from China, has made setting prices more like rolling the dice. “If we don't know the rules of the game, how are we supposed to play?” Holm asked. The other companies in the lawsuit he joined are also small businesses, including a plumbing supply company in Utah, a wine importer from New York and a fishing-tackle maker in Pennsylvania. Holm started working for the company more than a decade ago, taking up cycling in earnest alongside the job. He often rides his bike to work and props it outside his office, alongside the company's designers and salespeople. A thin man with deep-set eyes and side-parted hair, Holm was named president about two years ago as the company started by women's cycling pioneer Georgena Terry was wrestling with a downturn in the outdoor market after the coronavirus pandemic. More butts on bikes and getting out there.” The businesses challenging Trump's tariffs are represented by Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian-leaning legal group usually more aligned with conservative causes. But they say Trump is wrong on sweeping tariffs, which are projected to collect a total of some $3 trillion from businesses over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. They argue the president is using an emergency powers law that doesn't even mention tariffs to claim nearly unlimited powers to impose and change import duties at will, something no other president has done on such a scale. Terry Precision Cycling President Nik Holm, inspects a bike shirt at the company's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. The president has been vocal about the case, suggesting at one point he might go to the arguments himself — something no other sitting president is recorded to have done. “That's one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don't win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled financial mess for many, many years to come,” he said. The law Trump used for many of his tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, has been invoked dozens of times over the decades, often to impose sanctions on other countries. But no president had used it for tariffs until February, when Trump placed duties on China, Mexico and Canada. He said the countries had not been doing enough to stop illegal immigration and drug trafficking. In April, he unveiled “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners with a baseline of 10% and higher increases for specific countries, though many of those have since been put on hold. Tariffs on China hit 145% at one point but have since come down and are headed to 20% overall under Trump's latest deal with China. Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the emergency-powers tariffs. The Supreme Court also will hear two other cases on Wednesday, one from a group of Democratic-leaning states and another from an Illinois educational toy company. The justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power. But they have been skeptical of presidential claims of power before, as when Joe Biden tried to forgive $400 billion in student loans under a different law dealing with national emergencies. Trump's tariffs, by contrast, are expected to total in the trillions. They're also projected to increase people's bills by about $2,000 per household this year, an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found. Trump has acknowledged that Americans could feel some short-term pain from tariffs but maintained that they'll bring about more favorable trade deals and help American manufacturing. For the people at Terry Precision Cycling, though, those big-picture political questions were far from their decision to join the lawsuit. Holm thought more about the company's 20 or so employees, its legacy and the women who buy its products out of a love for cycling. “If it becomes so unaffordable for them to do it, less can enter into that joy, that freedom of being on a bike,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday. US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections. She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections. “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.” President Trump's attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.” A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult. Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote. Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare. Other lawsuits against Trump's election executive order are ongoing. In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump's executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump cannot alter federal voter registration forms to require proof of citizenship, a judge ruled Friday. Kollar-Kotelly deemed unconstitutional Trump's March executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national mail voter registration form. “The first question presented in these consolidated cases is whether the President, acting unilaterally, may direct changes to federal election procedures. The judge is an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. Her ruling came as a judgment in the case brought by several Democratic groups against Trump's executive order titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it. We expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” Jackson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. Trump pitched the March executive order as a measure to ensure election integrity. The White House released a fact sheet saying that the order “strengthens voter citizenship verification and bans foreign nationals from interfering in U.S. elections.” “Nearly a century of leadership has taught us that when civil rights are threatened, we must act boldly and without hesitation.”</p>

Trump administration lawyers are inquiring how the Department of Agriculture can legally tap into contingency funds to keep food stamps rolling during the government shutdown.

Federal judge Jack McConnell in Rhode Island ruled Friday that the Trump administration must use contingency funds to keep Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs subsidized as the government shutdown nears its 32nd day. 

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social Friday evening in response to the opinion, saying federal lawyers “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available,” and that he directed them to get further information.

“I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” Trump wrote.

SNAP benefits were set to expire at the end of the day Friday, leaving the approximate 41.7 million Americans, who use SNAP benefits without access to the means through which they buy food on Nov. 1. McConnell's ruling pointed to a SNAP contingency fund of about $5 billion for the administration to use, though it would not be enough to last the entire month of November.

Trump said that even if the courts provide “immediate guidance” on how to use the contingency funds, “it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.”

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” Trump wrote.

JUDGE RULES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST RELEASE EMERGENCY SNAP FUNDS

McConnell issued his ruling shortly after federal Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts issued a similar ruling that deemed the decision to halt SNAP payments “unlawful.” 

The rulings came just days after dozens of states sued the Trump administration over the Department of Agriculture's decision not to issue November SNAP payments during the government shutdown.</p>
