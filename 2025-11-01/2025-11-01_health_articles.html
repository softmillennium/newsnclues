                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Delirium, commonly observed in critically ill patients following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), is an acute neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. This study aimed to explore the functional connectivity (FC) of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in delirium patients with basal ganglia ICH and to identify potential biomarkers for predicting delirium onset. In this cross-sectional study, brain networkomics techniques were used to examine the FC within the ARAS in ICH patients with and without delirium. A two-sample t-test compared differences in ARAS connectivity between delirium and non-delirium groups, identifying abnormal brain regions and their corresponding FC values. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was then performed to evaluate the predictive value of FC for delirium onset. A significant disruption in FC between the brainstem ARAS nuclei and the left parahippocampal gyrus was observed in ICH patients with delirium. The FC strength between these regions was a reliable predictor of delirium occurrence, with an area under the curve of 0.893, indicating high predictive accuracy. The corresponding FC strength could serve as an effective biomarker for predicting delirium onset. Restoring normal connectivity between these regions holds potential as a strategy for early reversal of delirium and represents a key focus for future research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Columbia University Fertility Center reported the first successful pregnancy using an AI-guided method they developed to recover sperm in men with azoospermia, in which ejaculate contains little or no sperm. Male factors account for approximately 40% of couples with infertility. A semen sample can appear totally normal, but when you look under the microscope you discover just a sea of cellular debris, with no sperm visible. Many couples with male-factor infertility are told they have little chance of having a biological child." Men with azoospermia may undergo a procedure to have sperm surgically extracted from the testes, but the procedure is often unsuccessful and can cause vascular problems, inflammation, or a temporary decrease in testosterone levels. "The field has really been challenged to find a better way to identify and retrieve viable sperm cells in men with exceedingly low sperm counts," Williams says. Williams assembled a team of researchers and clinicians to develop a new method that combines a variety of technologies to identify and retrieve rare sperm cells from men with azoospermia. "Our team included experts in advanced imaging techniques, microfluidics, and reproductive endocrinology to tackle each individual step required to find and isolate rare sperm," says Hemant Suryawanshi, an assistant professor of reproductive sciences at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and project leader. The STAR (Sperm Tracking and Recovery) method, unveiled earlier this year, employs high-powered imaging technology to scan through a semen sample from men with azoospermia, taking over 8 million images in under an hour. Within milliseconds, a robot gently removes the sperm cell so that it can be used to create an embryo or frozen and stored for future use. STAR was tested in a patient that had been trying to start a family for nearly 20 years, including multiple IVF cycles at other centers, several manual sperm searches, and two surgical procedures to extract sperm. In about two hours, STAR scanned 2.5 million images, identifying 2 viable sperm cells, which were then used to create two embryos and start a pregnancy. The findings, though based on one case, show the feasibility of this technology to overcome long-standing barriers in helping men with azoospermia. "You only need one healthy sperm to create an embryo," Williams says. Larger clinical studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of STAR in broader patient populations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Sean Fletcher walked into Sam Biswas' Medical and Molecular Sciences (MMSC) lab at the University of Delaware College of Health Sciences during the summer of his first year, he had no research or laboratory experience. Two years later, the senior honors medical diagnostics major has published a paper as a first author after uncovering new insights into how human papillomavirus (HPV) functions on a molecular level. In a study recently published in Virology Journal, Fletcher and co-authors Biswas, professor of MMSC, and Esther Biswas-Fiss, professor and chair of MMSC, used bioinformatics to pinpoint conserved regions of the HPV E2 protein, which plays a critical role in the virus's ability to replicate and cause cancer. The team found that specific mutations may alter protein function, significantly increasing cancer risk. Sean Fletcher (right), an aspiring physician, talks about the role of bioinformatics in his research with mentors Esther Biswas-Fiss (left), professor and chair of the Department of Medical and Molecular Sciences, and Sam Biswas (center), professor of medical and molecular sciences. It's a feat Fletcher, a first-generation college student and Delaware native, who's bound for medical school, never dreamed of when he first came to UD. "I knew UD had a solid research portfolio, and I'm grateful to have taken advantage of early opportunities to get involved and explore the vast world of HPV research," said Fletcher. The day after Fletcher's paper was published, Fletcher got a call from Thomas Jefferson's Sidney Kimmel Medical College to schedule an interview-a timely development that underscored the value of his publication. "That's the power of a first-author paper," said Biswas proudly. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world, affecting up to 80% of sexually active adults. "One person can be infected with a dozen or more HPV types simultaneously," said Biswas. "We still don't know how they interact with one another; there's a lot that remains unknown." While younger adults with stronger immune systems clear HPV within two years, the 400-million-year-old virus can lie dormant in the body for years, making it harder to eliminate in people over 40. For men, there's no test for HPV, and many discover they have the virus only after a cancer diagnosis. Biswas-Fiss emphasized that understanding the virus on a molecular level is key to preventing and treating HPV. "Many studies have focused on clinical and epidemiological approaches, including our work to determine which genotypes are more prevalent in different parts of the world," she said. "But to prevent and treat HPV, we must better understand how it causes cancer on a molecular level." "We must study the virus both computationally and in the lab, and with this paper, we've made major headway," said Biswas-Fiss. "It opens a new avenue for researchers to explore." Over the next year, Fletcher plans to continue using computational biology as a microscope to examine every atom in HPV proteins. His ongoing research is supported through the Delaware INBRE Academic Year Undergraduate Fellows Award, following his participation in the Delaware INBRE Summer Student Research Program. "What I'm doing now couldn't have been done five years ago. Using machine learning, we can identify hidden patterns in proteins and test ways to block protein interactions to prevent them from causing cancer," said Fletcher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research led by the University of Minnesota Medical School demonstrates that molecules acting as "molecular bumpers" and "molecular glues" can rewire G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, turning the cell's busiest receptors into precision tools - opening the door to a new generation of safer, smarter medicines. Although they are the largest family of successful drug targets, scientists recognize that these receptors still hold untapped potential as targets for new treatments. These receptors can activate a plethora of signaling pathways downstream of 16 different G proteins, resulting in different cellular and physiological effects. Some of these pathways may be therapeutically useful, while others lead to unwanted side effects, limiting the potential for therapeutic development. The capability to design drugs that produce only selected signaling outcomes may yield safer, more effective medicines. Until now, it hasn't been obvious how to do this." In this study, the research team, including chemists at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP), describe a strategy to design compounds that selectively activate a subset of the receptor's normal signaling pathways. In their study of the neurotensin receptor 1, a type of GPCR, the research team found that compounds binding this intracellular receptor site can act as molecular glues - promoting interactions with some signaling partners - and as molecular bumpers, preventing interactions with other signaling partners. "Most drugs 'turn up' or 'turn down' all of a receptor's signaling uniformly," Dr. Slosky said. Using modeling, they designed new compounds with diverse signaling profiles, leading to different biological effects. "We controlled which signaling pathways were turned on and which ones were turned off by changing the chemical structure of the compound," said Steven Olson, PhD, the executive director of Medicinal Chemistry at SBP and study co-author. "Most importantly, these changes were predictable and can be used by medicinal chemists to rationally design new drugs." For the neurotensin receptor 1, the ultimate goal is to discover treatments for chronic pain and addiction that minimize side effects. Because this intracellular site is common to the GPCR superfamily, this strategy is likely transferrable to many receptors and may lead to novel treatments for a wide array of diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from the University of Wisconsin–Madison reveals that dysfunction in a protein essential to maintaining stability in our chromosomes may be responsible for serious - and sometimes deadly - diseases. Their findings, published today in Science, could provide patients and their doctors with new protein mutations to test for certain cancers and bone marrow diseases. Our chromosomes (bundles of proteins and DNA that store all our genetic information), are protected from degradation by telomeres - the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes made from repetitive DNA sequences and proteins. While telomeres naturally shorten as we age, dysfunction in telomere formation and maintenance can make DNA less stable, leading to premature aging and other diseases. Malfunctions in these proteins could be the cause of some diseases resulting from shortened telomeres. It deepens clinical understanding of telomere diseases," says Lim, whose work is supported by the National Institutes of Health. The researchers, led by graduate student Sourav Agrawal, research scientist Xiuhua Lin, and postdoctoral researcher Vivek Susvirkar, searched for proteins likely to interact with telomerase using AlphaFold, a machine learning tool that predicts the 3D structure of proteins and protein-protein interactions. They found that a molecule called replication protein A (RPA) plays an essential role in maintaining telomeres by stimulating telomerase. Guided by their findings from AlphaFold, the team experimentally validated that, in humans, RPA is required to stimulate telomerase and help maintain telomeres. Their findings, Lim says, have immediate implications for some patients with often fatal illnesses resulting from shortened telomeres, including aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. "There are some patients with shortened telomere disorders that couldn't be explained with our previous body of knowledge," explains Lim. Lim and his team have received inquiries from clinicians and scientists around the world asking if their patients' diseases could be the result of genetic mutations inhibiting RPA's newfound function. There are colleagues reaching out from France, Israel, and Australia. They just want to give a cause for their patient's short telomere disease so that the patients and their families can understand what is happening and why. With biochemical analysis, we can test their patients' mutation to see if it impacts how RPA interacts with telomerase, and give the doctors insights into possible causes of their patients' diseases." Human RPA is an essential telomerase processivity factor for maintaining telomeres.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This study aimed to investigate the causal effects of immune cells and inflammatory proteins on epilepsy and evaluate the mediating role of inflammatory proteins. This study utilized the largest available genome-wide association study data on immune cell phenotypes and inflammatory proteins as exposures, and epilepsy genome-wide association study data from the FinnGen dataset as outcomes. Furthermore, a two-step MR analysis was conducted to quantify the proportion of epilepsy and its subtypes influenced by immune cells through inflammatory proteins. The two-sample MR analysis identified 32 immune cell phenotypes associated with epilepsy risk (19 risk-increasing, e.g., CD19+ B cells; 13 protective, e.g., regulatory T cell subsets). Eight inflammatory proteins showed suggestive causal effects on epilepsy: C-C chemokine ligand 23, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 6, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11, and vascular endothelial growth factor A increased epilepsy risk, while interleukin-13 (IL-13), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, tumor necrosis factor, and osteoprotegerin conferred protection. Mediation analysis indicated that inflammatory proteins mediated 6.3–13.5% of the immune effects on epilepsy. Specifically, CD14+CD16+ monocytes increased epilepsy risk through elevated C-C chemokine ligand 23 levels (8.5% mediation), while effector memory double-negative (CD4−CD8−) T cells reduced epilepsy risk via upregulation of IL-13 (6.3%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings (P heterogeneity/pleiotropy > 0.05). Although no associations reached Bonferroni-corrected significance, the findings implicate B cells, monocytes, regulatory T cells, and cytokines (e.g., IL-13, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor) in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, with inflammatory proteins acting as partial mediators. These results enhance our understanding of immune-inflammatory pathways in epilepsy and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Future studies should validate these findings across diverse populations and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the identified associations.
