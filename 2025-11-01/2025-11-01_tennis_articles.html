                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In their first two meetings this season, Iga Swiatek and Madison Keys went the distance. Swiatek dominated from start to finish, 6-1, 6-2, to seal the Serena Williams Group meeting in just 61 minutes.“All the things that I practiced, I got it together today to play with the right balance in terms of being solid and aggressive,” she said during her on-court interview. That gives me confidence to go forward and develop as a player. Opening singles play at the WTA Finals in Riyadh Saturday, their 2025 rubber match was a completely different story.

Swiatek staved off two break points in the final game to move ahead 6-2 in the pair's head-to-head series, capping her day by claiming 10 of 12 points against her opponent's second serve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the ATP Tour's most prolific indoor performers is showing no sign of slowing down at the Rolex Paris Masters. Felix Auger-Aliassime on Saturday continued his late-2025 purple patch with an impressive 7-6(3), 6-4 semi-final victory against Alexander Bublik in the French capital. The ninth-seeded Canadian was clinical with his chances in his 96-minute victory to secure a spot in his second ATP Masters 1000 final and simultaneously replace Lorenzo Musetti in the final qualification spot for the Nitto ATP Finals. A Masters 1000 final sounds really good,” said Auger-Aliassime after reaching his second championship match at that level after Madrid 2024. “You don't play those finals every week. In terms of today and even the past matches… You get into a Masters, and every match is tough. You wake up on a day and feel, ‘This guy is playing good, everybody is playing good'. I have deep self confidence in my game. I know what I can do against the best players in the world, but you still have to go and execute. As well as setting a championship-match clash with second seed Jannik Sinner or third seed Alexander Zverev in Paris, Auger-Aliassime also made a significant move in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin with his semi-final triumph. If Auger-Aliassime does not lift the Paris trophy, he will nonetheless head to next week's Moselle Open in Metz with a 90-point lead over Musetti in the Live Race. “These are the matches you train for and play for,” said Auger-Aliassime, when asked how he would approach Sunday's final against Sinner or Zverev in Paris. “It's always great to play these guys and see how my game matches with theirs. You are training all these years to improve. “I've played some great opponents and tomorrow I have the chance to showcase it in front of everyone. At the same time, with these guys, you have to be so sharp. Against Bublik, Auger-Aliassime clinched a tight first set that did not feature a break point by winning six of the final seven points in the tie-break. Against the big-serving Bublik, who was competing in his maiden Masters 1000 semi-final, Auger-Aliassime also clinically converted three of the four break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He has now won a Tour-leading 82 indoor matches this decade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's also a win away from the biggest title of his career.ByJohn BerkokPublished Nov 01, 2025 copy_link Felix Auger-Aliassime is through to the final of the Rolex Paris Masters after ending the run of Alexander Bublik in the semifinals of the Masters 1000 event on Saturday afternoon, 7-6 (3), 6-4.With that victory, the Canadian is now one win away from the biggest title of his career—his biggest titles to date are three ATP 500s, at Rotterdam and Basel in 2022 and Basel again in 2023.But just as (if not more) pressing, Auger-Aliassime is now one win away from qualifying for this year's ATP Finals in Turin.

There was little between Auger-Aliassime and Bublik in the first set on Saturday, with 12 straight holds to start the match, and the Canadian sneaking out the 50-minute opening frame in a tie-break.There were all kinds of momentum swings in the second set, though, as Bublik broke early for a 2-0 lead—and then, after getting broken right back, breaking again for a 3-1 lead, and then holding for 4-1.But Auger-Aliassime caught fire from there, reeling off five games in a row—and 14 of the last 17 points of the match—to close it out.The Canadian finished with more than twice as many winners as the Kazakh, 31 to 15, as well as fewer unforced errors, 21 to 23. A Masters 1000 final sounds really good," Auger-Aliassime said after the match. "You don't play those finals every week, every day, so hopefully I can go all the way and get the title. "But in terms of today, and even the last matches, you get to a Masters and every match is tough. So you're always curious and a bit nervous about how your game's going to match up with them.
