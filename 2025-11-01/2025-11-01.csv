            Fighting for control of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area.
    


            In recent weeks, Russian units have begun penetrating Pokrovsk itself and have closed in on the last resupply routes used to sustain Ukrainian forces in the town.
    


            The Ukrainian special forces had landed in a helicopter on the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It's unclear when the mission took place.
    


            A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.
    


            The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.
    


            Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.
    


            The Ukrainian military's commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.”
    


            “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense.
    


            Enemy units continued “to attempt to infiltrate residential areas and cut off our supply routes,” he added.
    


            For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening.
    


            President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.
    


            Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.
    


            Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.
    


            According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.
    


            Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO's expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.
    


            Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.
    


            As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia's energy and military infrastructure.
    


            On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country's defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.
    


            “The ‘Koltsevoy' oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine's Defense Intelligence (DI).
    


            It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air.
    


            “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said.
    


            Unlike many recent attacks using drones and missiles, the Ukrainians used a sabotage team to lay explosive devices at the site, according to the DI video.
    


            There's been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. But the local authorities in the nearby district of Zhukovsky reported power cuts for some consumers on Friday without specifying the cause.
    


            The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. It is capable of pumping up to 3 million tons of aviation fuel, up to 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and up to 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, according to DI.
    


            Ukraine began targeting Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory.
    


            “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.”
    


            Ukraine's President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as 20% of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages.
    


            Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.

            The rapid fall from grace of the now former Prince Andrew, culminating in his humiliating exile by King Charles III to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning.
    


            His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he's been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of Royal Lodge, the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades.
    


            It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch's retreat in rural Norfolk.
    


            Here's what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home.
    


            Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew's elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.
    


            Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That's because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.
    


Sandringham was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.
    


            Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England's east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.
    


            Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.
    


            The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II's first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.
    


            Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.
    


            The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.
    


            King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II's father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”
    


            The property's gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.
    


            Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate's management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.
    


            No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.
    


York Cottage, previously known as Bachelor's Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.
    


Gardens House is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate's head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.
    


The Folly is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.
    


Park House is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.
    


Wood Farm is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew's parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.
    


            Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is Anmer Hall, which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.
    


            Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            Public fury was compounded after the publication of a posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.
    


            Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy's reputation further.
    


Brother of Virginia Giuffre calls for a meeting with King Charles to shed more light on the Epstein case



            His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.
    


            Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King's actions to remove Andrew's titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein's despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said.
    


            Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign.
    


            In comparison, Andrew's current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family's land and property holdings on behalf of the British state.
    


            It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling.
    


The unanswered questions hanging over the Prince Andrew scandal



            His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham.
    


            The two Pembroke Welsh corgis, Muick and Sandy, that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II will remain in the care of Andrew's family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain's PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

The German military is moving ahead with contracts worth €900 million ($1.05 billion) for kamikaze drones, even though some of the systems failed crucial field tests or were not tested at all, according to media reports published on Friday.

The prospective deals involve three German companies – Stark, Helsing, and Rheinmetall – and form part of a broader plan to bolster the Bundeswehr's unmanned aerial capabilities, according to the Financial Times.

Bild, however, cited defense sources who described a problematic test held in late October at a training range near Munster. During the trials, two drones supplied by the startup Stark failed to hit their intended targets. One reportedly missed by more than 150 meters, while another crashed into nearby woodland. Rheinmetall, a traditional arms manufacturer and new entrant to the drone market, reportedly did not participate in the evaluation at all.

According to the FT, Stark, which was founded in late 2024 and backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, Sequoia Capital, and NATO's Innovation Fund, had also taken part in British Army trials in Kenya this month, where its drones similarly failed to strike their targets.

“It was a disaster for Stark,” one source briefed on the German trials told the outlet. “They've been overselling [their capabilities] and are now paying the price.”

Despite the setbacks, both Stark and Rheinmetall were selected to receive €300 million contracts each just days after the Munster test, Bild said. Final approval from the German parliament is still pending, but additional evaluations are expected.

The procurement effort is part of a wider EU push for rapid militarization under the justification of preparing for a potential confrontation with Russia – an argument Moscow dismisses as false and a distraction from Europe's internal woes.

German defense companies, along with other Western arms producers, have seen record profits since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict and the EU's open-ended commitment to continue arming Kiev “for as long as it takes.”

US President Donald Trump has dismissed Prime Minister Viktor Orban's request to exempt Hungary from sanctions on Russian oil.

Orban said in an interview with Kossuth Radio on Friday he will try to persuade Trump during his upcoming visit to Washington to grant Hungary relief from the sanctions on Russian energy companies Rosneft and Lukoil, which supply oil to Central Europe.

The US blacklisted the two companies last week, alleging a lack of commitment by Moscow to the Ukraine peace process. Hungary has repeatedly stated that Russian oil and gas are vital to its energy security.

Questioned by journalists aboard Air Force One later in the day, Trump said Orban “has asked for an exemption, but we have not granted one.”

“He is a friend of mine,” he added, while suggesting that the journalists move on to other questions.

Orban told Kossuth Radio that, as a landlocked country, Hungary has no viable alternatives to Russian oil, and that replacing it would push the nation toward an economic crisis.

“We have to make the Americans understand this peculiar situation... if we want them to allow exemptions from the American sanctions against Russia,” he stated.

The Hungarian prime minister said he would bring a “large delegation” of ministers, economic officials, and security advisers to Washington on November 7 in order to finalize an economic cooperation package with the US. He stressed, however, that any deal would depend on continued access to Russian oil and gas.

Hungary, which has maintained a neutral stance on the Ukraine conflict, is also facing growing pressure within the EU to reduce its reliance on Russian energy, as the bloc plans to phase out oil and gas imports from the country by 2028.

Orban, a key Trump ally in the EU, visited the US several times during last year's presidential campaign to support his candidacy. In recent months, he has praised the US president's efforts to stop the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

President Vladimir Putin earlier described the US sanctions on Russian oil companies as an “unfriendly move,” but said they would not have a significant impact on the economy.

US President Donald Trump has denied that he is planning strikes on Venezuela, whose left-wing government he has accused of supporting “narcoterrorist” cartels.

Multiple media outlets reported that the White House was weighing potential operations on Venezuelan soil, with the Wall Street Journal claiming on Thursday that the US had identified targets, including “military facilities used to smuggle drugs.”

Asked about the reports aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said, “No. It's not true.”

Since September, the US has destroyed at least 14 alleged cartel boats in the Caribbean, killing more than 61 people, according to Reuters.

Trump dispatched an armada to the region, including the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, and authorized covert CIA operations inside Venezuela. He recently said the US may have to eventually strike targets on land, but denied seeking to topple President Nicolas Maduro, whom the FBI has placed on its wanted list.

Maduro rejected the allegations of drug trafficking and vowed to defend the country in the event of an invasion. Last week, he accused the US of “fabricating a new war” and called for peace.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro also condemned Washington's actions, saying that one of the strikes had killed an ordinary fisherman with no links to cartels.

BRUSSELS, November 1. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's ""erratic policy shifts"" have shaken Europe's confidence in cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States, Politico wrote citing sources.

According to the report, CIA Director John Ratcliffe made a low-key stop in Brussels this week to meet with EU officials and ease their concerns about intelligence sharing. The visit comes as the European capitals are growing increasingly worried about US foreign policies under Trump.

Sources told Politico that the ""Trump administration's erratic policy shifts on Ukraine,"" such as such as an abrupt halt in the sharing of battlefield intelligence with Kiev in March, and its push to politicize intelligence by appointing Trump loyalists, have shaken European confidence in Washington's reliability.

Thomas Jacob Sanford, who also lit church on fire, was killed by police who responded to September shooting

The former US marine who opened fire in a Michigan church and set it ablaze in September was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI said on Friday.

While friends of the gunman in the deadly shooting have said he harbored hatred for what is widely known as the Mormon church, the FBI had previously declined to specify the motivation behind the attack that left four people dead and the church burned to the ground, except to say it was a “targeted” act of violence.

The gunman, Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, was killed by law enforcement responding to the shooting.

“I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant's anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. The agency declined to share further information on what led to its conclusion.

Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Mormon chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80km) north-west of Detroit, on Sunday, 28 September, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire.

Body-camera footage released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling: “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells another: “I've got your back, back here, man. Yeah, stay there. Shoot him!”

The FBI said on Friday that nine people were injured in the attack. The previous official count had been eight.

“During our investigation, an additional individual was determined to be ‘injured' during the Grand Blanc critical incident,” a spokesperson said in a statement.

The agency declined to comment on Friday on the nature of the additional injury.

The four people who were killed have been identified through family and friends as Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong.

Lisa Louis, who was in the chapel when her father, Hayden, was fatally shot, wrote in a letter that after looking into the shooter's eyes, she forgave him “with my heart”.

In October, top church leaders preached a message of love and forgiveness in the wake of the attack while gathered for the faith's twice-annual general conference in its home state of Utah. Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an online fundraiser for the gunman's family.

The church said it strengthened its security protocols for the conference and, days later, for the funeral of its oldest-ever president, who died a day before the Michigan shooting.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not have a comment on Friday.

Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI's statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears – that this attack was motivated by hatred”.

“This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said.

Malone grew up attending events at the church where the attack occurred. He said local Latter-day Saints have been uplifted by an outpouring of love from the Grand Blanc Township community and other religious congregations.

Authorities have released little information about Sanford and the attack. People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.

An attorney acting as a spokesperson for Sanford's family did not immediately return a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The state has killed 15 people this year with two more scheduled this month as death penalty in decline across US

Death penalty opponents have decried an unprecedented surge in executions ordered by Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, after the state maintained a record pace with last week's killing of a military veteran.

Norman Mearle Grim, who was convicted of the 1998 murder and rape of a neighbor, became the 15th person put to death this year, by lethal injection, at the Florida state prison in Starke on Wednesday.

With two active death warrants also signed by DeSantis for prisoners on death row, and their executions scheduled before the end of November, Florida will have shattered its previous record of eight in a calendar year since the supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, set in 1984 and 2014.

“This is what happens when a government loses its conscience. When mercy is replaced with machinery. When killing becomes routine and our leaders tout the body count as an achievement,” a statement from the advocacy group Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty said in part after officials confirmed Grim's death.

DeSantis has offered no public reason for the exponential upswing in executions, and his office did not respond to an inquiry by the Guardian.

But groups opposed to the death penalty see only one explanation: the political ambitions of the lame duck governor, who will be termed out of office in January 2027 and has, many believe, his sights set on succeeding Donald Trump in the White House.

It's a formula they say they have seen from him before, most recently in 2023, when he announced his ultimately ill-fated run at his party's presidential nomination and ordered six executions, after none had taken place in the state during the previous three years.

In 2024, after DeSantis's candidacy flopped, only one execution took place.

“It's disgusting and disgraceful. The only logical or plain explanation is that Governor DeSantis is planning on running for the 2028 nomination,” said Justin Mazzola, deputy director of research at Amnesty International US.

“In 2023 he starts running for president and all of a sudden we see a huge jump, and it seems he's using the same playbook, basically showing that he's tough on crime. It just shows how insecure and small he is as a person, he's nothing more than a bully, just like Trump is. To them, this is the way to demonstrate their power, carrying out these executions.”

Figures from the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) show that there have been 41 executions so far this year in the US, with Texas having the next highest number to Florida with five. With five more scheduled nationwide before the end of the year, two of them in Florida, it means that DeSantis will have accounted for almost 40% of the nation's total.

“One of the most troubling things is the secrecy about why we are seeing this incredibly high number of executions,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the DPIC.

“We have absolutely no explanation from Governor DeSantis, and he alone has the authority to select people for execution and set those execution dates. Floridians, the people that elected this man, are in the complete dark about why the state is investing so much money and energy into executing prisoners this year instead of investing in other things that the population might be in greater need of.

“People expect their elected officials to be transparent and to be accountable for those decisions. We have neither in this case.”

Maher said Florida's accelerated pace had exerted pressure on the legal system and affected the mental health of those caught up in the whirlwind.

“We have been talking a lot about the collateral consequences of the death penalty and how it affects communities and families and so many others beyond just the prisoner who is being executed,” she said.

“The defenders are under enormous strain. In Florida, there have been executions set roughly every two weeks for the entire year, and that has put enormous pressure on the defenders to try to save their clients' lives, and they are doing so, you know, with tremendous workloads, without sufficient resources, and under extremely short timeframes that no other professional should be expected to operate and perform in.”

Of note, she added, was that five of the 15 executed in Florida this year were military veterans.

“That's quite astonishing considering Governor DeSantis is also a military veteran and has said Florida is one of the most veteran-friendly states in the country,” she said.

Overall, the number of executions has declined significantly across the country since 2000, when 85 took place, almost half of them in Texas. That drop, to only 11 in 2021, makes Florida an outlier, analysts say.

Craig Trocino, director of Miami Law's Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami, said legislation in Florida had undergone several changes in recent years, most prominently a 2023 law that reduced the requirement for a death penalty from a unanimous jury verdict in favor to an eight-juror majority.

DeSantis pushed for the legislation after the life of Nikolas Cruz, convicted of the 2018 shooting at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school that killed 17 students and staff, was spared by three holdouts on the jury of 12.

“The Florida legislature, backed by the governor, has attempted to do anything that they can to make death sentences easier to obtain,” Trocino said. “If the death penalty is going to exist, and I don't think it should, then the rule of the day should not be expedience, it should be deliberation.

“Florida leads the nation in people who were exonerated from death row, the last count is 30. So when you have a history of getting it wrong, the last thing you should be doing is speeding it up.”

Risk to general public is low but cases in California suggest virus is spreading undetected in some communities

A newer variant of mpox, the virus formerly known as monkeypox, is now spreading through some communities in the US and Europe.

The risk to the general public is low, but community transmission in new places signals greater challenges for public health to detect cases and stop the spread.

In October, California announced three cases of the newer variant, known as clade Ib. All three of the patients – two in Los Angeles and one in Long Beach – were hospitalized and are now recovering.

None of the patients had apparent links to each other and none had traveled internationally recently, indicating the virus is likely spreading undetected in some communities. There have been six cases of the new mpox variant found among travelers in the US, but this is the first sign of community spread.

The news comes as several European countries – Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal – also report apparent community transmission of the newer variant, and the older variant continues to circulate globally.

There have been more than 44,000 cases of mpox reported so far in 2025, according to the World Health Organization. That's more than the total reported in 2024.

The three cases in California appear may be linked genomically and may trace back to a travel case from August, according to the American Hospital Association. The industry group said this information was released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an advisory on Wednesday, although that advisory does not appear to be available publicly.

The US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond by press time to the Guardian's media inquiry about potential genomic links between the cases and whether the virus appeared to be spreading in specific networks.

“Given that the three cases in Los Angeles were all hospitalized, that lends a little bit more credence to the idea that maybe there is local transmission going on,” said Miguel Paredes, a genomic epidemiologist at the University of Washington.

In Los Angeles, about one in 33 cases of the older mpox variant is currently being detected, according to an October study, co-authored by Paredes, which has not been peer-reviewed or published.

“If you're thinking about a 3% case fatality rate, and we're capturing the ones that are ‘more severe', then we're not really capturing the ones that are potentially less severe,” he said.

Vaccination may also complicate the picture.

“Vaccines are doing a good job of sometimes preventing infection but also creating less severe disease, which is good on an individual's side. But it also makes passive surveillance a little difficult, because if you have less severe disease, you're less likely to seek treatment or actually think you have mpox,” Paredes said.

That means researchers and officials need to be more proactive about finding and monitoring cases, not just recording the cases of people who seek care, he said. Wastewater sampling would be one relatively inexpensive and unobtrusive way to monitor spread, he added.

In 2022, cases of the clade IIb mpox variant exploded internationally, infecting nearly 100,000 people around the world. About a third of the detected cases were in the US. The vast majority of those cases were among men who have sex with men.

Yet the new variant, which appears to have emerged in mid-2023 and was first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has not shown the same pattern. It has infected men and women, usually between the ages of 25 and 40, at roughly the same rate.

The outbreak in central and eastern Africa has spread through what Jason Kindrachuk calls “dense sexual networks”, or people with multiple sexual partners.

“It's a big piece of it,” said Kindrachuk, who is an international expert on mpox and vice president of the National Microbiology Laboratory branch of the Public Health Agency of Canada.

“Dense sexual networks increased risk transmission generally. Regardless if you're male or female, you had an increased probability or increased risk of getting infected if you were within those networks.”

But it's difficult to know if the same pattern would continue in other countries, he said. “Trying to make assessments of what is going to happen in other regions of the world when you are looking at DRC or central Africa in general is very difficult.”

There have only been a few community cases of the new variant detected internationally, so it's not possible yet to make broad statements about the kinds of networks where it is spreading, Kindrachuk said.

California has not released information about the gender or the sexuality of the patients. But the press release indicated the newer variant was “primarily impacting communities of gay and bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men, as well as their social networks”.

People are at higher risk for mpox if they are gay, bisexual, or a man who has sex with men, or are transgender or nonbinary, and have had more than one partner in the past six months, according to the CDC.

People are also at risk if they have recently visited a sex venue, such as a sex club or bathhouse, or recently had sex at large events in places where mpox is spreading, the CDC notes. Mpox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which makes sexual contact a major mode of transmission.

The Trump administration has gutted international aid and development work, making it much more difficult to monitor and contain outbreaks like these. Officials in the US are focusing on vaccinating people who are at risk – some of whom may only have received the first of a two-part vaccine

“I always want to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Paredes said. “It's like a small thing that can go a long way in protecting you.”

Vaccines are more accessible when they are provided by the government rather than through private insurance, especially among low-resource communities, Paredes said. It also helps to offer shots outside of working hours and at easy-to-reach locations.

It may be more challenging to employ the same techniques that worked before to curb mpox. The US government is largely shut down, and the CDC has lost about a third of its staff this year due to layoffs and resignations.

Many of the public health networks used during the 2022 outbreak – STI and HIV monitoring, for example – have been on the chopping block under the second Trump administration.

Communities affected by mpox may once again take the lead fighting against this virus.

In 2022, organizations and members of the queer community worked together with officials to offer testing and vaccines, including at gatherings where people may be having intimate contact like sex.

“Really, we benefited from community-based organizations providing information and going out and trying to reduce that stigma,” Kindrachuk said. He also voiced appreciation for members of the affected communities for “empowering individuals to feel comfortable with moving forward for testing and to be able to identify risks and potential infections as well”.

TORONTO (AP) — Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week, slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third inning and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers held off the Blue Jays 3-1 on Friday night to force the World Series to a decisive Game 7.

Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. He lasted six innings and allowed a third-inning RBI single by George Springer, who returned after missing two games with a right side injury.

Rookie relievers Justin Wrobleski and Roki Sasaki combined for six outs before starter Tyler Glasnow came out of the bullpen to escape a ninth-inning jam and rescue the Dodgers.

Max Scherzer will start Game 7 on Saturday night for the Blue Jays. He also started the last Game 7, getting a no-decision when Washington won the 2019 title over Houston.

After a Addison Barger hit, the ball gets stuck in the wall during the ninth inning of the World Series Game 6 between the Blue Jays and Dodgers.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

The Blue Jays seemed on the verge of another one of their stunning comebacks in Game 6 of the World Series on Friday.

Though they trailed 3-1 in the ninth inning, Roki Sasaki, the Dodgers' closer, hit Toronto's leadoff batter, Alejandro Kirk.

Kirk was then replaced by the speedy Myles Straw, who came on as a pinch runner. Addison Barger laced a double to left-centre field, but the ball landed at the bottom of the wall and got momentarily wedged beneath it.

As the crowd at Rogers Centre roared, Straw and Barger rounded the bases for an apparent 3-3 tie. However, the ball was declared dead, and the play was declared a ground-rule double. Straw was sent back to third and Barger to second.

Cathal Kelly: Heading into Game 7, the Blue Jays allow the Dodgers to regain their mojo

“We were feeling really good,” Straw said afterward in a very quiet Blue Jays clubhouse. “I definitely liked our chances. Somehow it didn't work out.”

Tyler Glasnow, who was lined up to start in Game 7 on Saturday, was called on to relieve Sasaki and retired Ernie Clement on an infield pop-up. With one out and both runners still in scoring position, Andres Gimenez scalded a line drive to left that looked like it would drop in, but it was caught by outfielder Kike Hernandez. He threw to second and caught Barger off the bag for a double play.

Game over, 3-1.

World Series tied at three wins a piece and headed for a deciding seventh game.

“I thought the ball hit by Andres was going to drop and I didn't want to get thrown out at third,” Barger said.

On his double, Barger said he did not see where the ball had landed. He didn't realize anything unusual had happened until he saw the umpires waving their hands and calling time out.

Daulton Varsho, Toronto's centrefielder, said the walls at Rogers Centre are very hard and almost always the ball caroms out.

This time, he said, it landed in a seam at the very bottom and got struck like a mouse in a glue trap.

“That is probably the only spot where that could have happened,” Varsho said. “It was a crazy inning. A couple of pitches and then it was over.”

Toronto got into the Dodgers' bullpen in the seventh after six strong innings from Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The Los Angeles relievers have been dicey and the door suddenly appeared to open. 

Max Scherzer set to start Saturday for Game 7

Sasaki, who throws nearly 100 miles per hour, allowed two batters to reach in the eighth and then the first two in the ninth.

The crowd of 44,000 stood on its feet but was silenced by a bit of good fortune for Los Angeles.

Toronto players shrugged off the defeat. Although they lost on a night where they could have eliminated the Dodgers, they still have another chance.

“We just have to move on to tomorrow, just like we have all year,” Varsho said.

U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra during an event at the Halifax Chamber of Commerce in September. He was appointed to the position by U.S. President Donald Trump in April.Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press

Let's recap.

Everything at the border is Canada's fault. We're not a real country and should just become the 51st state. Our economy will exist only to the extent that Donald Trump sweeps unwanted crumbs off his royal banquet table. 

If we find any of that obnoxious or insulting or just absurd given that the U.S. looks like it's about six months away from sinking into the sea under the weight of its own dysfunction, well, we're just being rude.

And this week, the American ambassador took things up several notches. Pete Hoekstra unleashed a profane tirade on David Paterson, Ontario's trade representative to the U.S., at the Canadian American Business Council gala on Monday. 

Gary Mason: Washington, we have a serious problem: Your ambassador to Canada

The rant was so intense that people nearby overheard how Mr. Hoekstra was enraged about the anti-tariff ad campaign that Ontario Premier Doug Ford launched in the U.S. Mr. Hoekstra's wife, Diane, circled back to apologize to Mr. Paterson afterward.

So where did this, uh, unconventional diplomat come from? 

Mr. Hoekstra represented Michigan in Congress for almost 20 years, and also made unsuccessful runs at the governor's office and the Senate. He was named ambassador to the Netherlands during Mr. Trump's first term, and he chaired the Michigan Republican Party during the 2024 election. Mr. Trump named him ambassador to Canada in April.

Mr. Hoekstra became rather infamous in his first ambassadorial role for a truly amazing little play in three acts. 

The first occurred in 2015, when Mr. Hoekstra said, “The Islamic movement has now gotten to a point where they have put Europe into chaos. Chaos in the Netherlands – there are cars that are being burned, there are politicians that are being burned. And yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.”

Act 2 opens in 2017, when a Dutch reporter interviewed him about his impending job as ambassador. Mr. Hoekstra's eyes went flat with fear when the man asked about those remarks. 

Gus Carlson: Ford the bully, Carney the conciliator: the dream team

“I didn't say that. That is actually an incorrect statement,” Mr. Hoekstra said, gravely, in response to the reporter's totally accurate recap. Then he tried to disarm things with a grin: “We would call it fake news.”

(This on its own is incredible, because it was a public panel and there is video of Mr. Hoekstra saying these things while sitting behind a little placard with his name on it.) 

The reporter pushed back on him dismissing this as fake news. And Mr. Hoekstra, bless his heart, looked him square in the eye and said, “I didn't call that fake news, I didn't use the words today.” The journalist paused and glanced back at the camera operator as if to verify his own sanity.

Which brings us to Act 3: Mr. Hoekstra's introductory news conference in The Hague. The Dutch reporters had a whole lot of questions about whether he would walk back those remarks, apologize or explain.

One of them had Mr. Hoekstra turn and read a plaque on the embassy fireplace, inscribed with a quote from John Adams, the first U.S. envoy: “May none but Honest and Wise Men ever rule under this Roof.” The reporter invited Mr. Hoekstra, if he possessed either of those qualities, to take back his remarks or else name one politician who had been set ablaze. 

Mr. Hoekstra turned back to the press with a frozen smile and said, “Thank you,” then tried to point at another reporter for a new question. The Dutch press was having none of it. “This is the Netherlands, you have to answer the question,” one reporter informed him.

By the time he was named ambassador to Canada this spring, Mr. Hoekstra was flexing some new muscles. His diplomatic output in this country has been laced with the edgy aggression of a minor bully punching a kid in the head, while glancing over to see if the alpha bully approves of his work.

At a G7 business summit in May, Mr. Hoekstra made a lame joke about bad investments and when the audience reacted with befuddlement, he said, “Some of my friends in Canada don't have the greatest sense of humour.”

In remarks at a Canadian-American economic conference in Bellevue, Wash., in July, he complained that Canadians were “mean and nasty” for refusing to travel to the U.S. and pulling American booze from store shelves. 

Then at the Global Business Forum in Banff in September, Colin Robertson, vice-president of the Canada Global Affairs Institute and a former diplomat, asked the ambassador what he was doing to help the Canada-U.S. relationship. The President didn't seem well-informed in declaring that Canada has nothing the U.S. needs, Mr. Robertson observed.

Take it from an ad man: Ford's anti-tariff Reagan ad was too good for such bad times

The U.S. ambassador was not happy.

“You may not like some of the things he says or whatever, but to describe the President as being uninformed, excuse me, you don't hear Americans talking about our disagreements with Canadian politicians and saying they're uninformed,” Mr. Hoekstra bristled. 

The world is undeniably a worse place for Mr. Trump being part of it, let alone running the joint. And the last thing anyone needs is some jumped-up Trump tribute band, playing the same songs slightly off-key and waiting for a nod of approval from the big guy. 

Mr. Hoekstra's aggression underlines how obnoxious and abusive the Trump administration has become. Canada has been swallowing indignities out of strategic necessity for months. Everyone has their limit.

The 1983 movie A Christmas Story revolves around a nine-year-old boy named Ralphie who hits one of those limits. Day-dreamy, with chubby cheeks and glasses, he's an easy target for the neighbourhood toughs, and Ralphie's usual tactic is to scuttle away.

Mr. Hoekstra in Traverse City, Mich., in October, 2024.Paul Sancya/The Associated Press

In one scene, Ralphie is walking dejectedly home after he's had a rotten day. That's when Scut Farkus, the huge, terrifying, yellow-eyed bully, fires a snowball at Ralphie's face and mocks him as he starts to cry.

But this time, Ralphie doesn't run. Instead, he leaps at Scut, knocking him backward into the snow, and proceeds to beat the ever-loving snot out of him, while a crowd of kids watches in awe. 

Until now, Canada has adopted Ralphie's usual tactic of scurrying away in self-preservation. That Ronald Reagan ad has drawn such wild-eyed fear and loathing from the White House that we can enjoy knowing that we threw one punch that connected with an eye socket.

Still, there's no denying we have little leverage compared with our tormentor, and that limits our response in ways that are both pragmatically and emotionally unsatisfying. 

But maybe it's not Ralphie who will administer the comeuppance. No matter how many lies they're told, eventually Americans will feel the damage of Mr. Trump's trade war directly, unavoidably. Then the bleached and drooping truth of the emperor's new wardrobe will be there for all to see. 

Look at how the world is already remaking itself in real time, like one of those animated time-lapse maps that shows the continents shifting over millennia. There's an unmistakable pattern to the drift now: The rest of the world is rearranging itself around, and away from, Donald Trump's United States. 

It doesn't matter whom he sends to scream us into submission; everyone can see that the new American exceptionalism is becoming the world's basket case.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit agreed on declarations regarding AI and changing demographics as it wrapped up on Saturday.

The 2025 summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum adopted a joint leaders' declaration as it concluded in South Korea on Saturday.

Leaders assembled in Gyeongju also agreed on an Artificial Intelligence Initiative and the APEC Framework for Cooperation on Population Structure Changes.

APEC member countries adopted a statement acknowledging the importance of a trade environment that promotes resilience and benefits for all.

The host, South Korea, said the United States has the most important role in Seoul's relations with neighboring North Korea.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he hoped to help US President Donald Trump play ""peacemaker"" on the Korean Peninsula, but he also urged China and Russia to play a part.

Speaking at the summit's closing ceremony, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China will host the annual APEC summit at the tech hub of Shenzhen next year in November.

It will be the third time China has hosted the meeting. Xi said Shenzhen, often described as China's Silicon Valley, is ""a miracle in the history of world development created by the Chinese people.""

He also proposed the establishment of a global organization to cooperate on artificial intelligence.

In his speech, Xi noted that APEC is the most important platform for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

The APEC region accounts for 50% of global trade and 61% of the world's total economic output.

Speaking at the summit on Friday, Xi had called for protection of the multilateral trading system and deeper economic cooperation.

With nearly all votes from the Dutch parliamentary election counted, the centrist D66 party has taken an insurmountable lead over far-right leader Geert Wilders, according to local news agency ANP.

A nail-bitting election in the Netherlands is likely to culminate with supporters of nationalist Geert Wilders losing to the centrist D66 party, led by 38-year-old Rob Jetten.

Local news agency ANP said its tally showed that Wilders' far-right Freedom Party (PVV) could no longer close the gap, despite D66 holding only a razor-thin majority of some 15,000 votes. 

""I am incredibly happy that ... we have become the biggest party in this election,"" Jetten told reporters. ""A historic result for the D66. At the same time, I feel a great responsibility.""

Later on Friday, Wilders made unsubstantiated claims of voting irregularities.

Jetten is now on course to become the Netherlands' youngest-ever prime minister, according to the figures from ANP, which compiles results from municipalities across the country.

The outcome marks a dramatic resurgence for D66, a pro-European, socially liberal party that campaigned on climate policy, affordable housing and restoring trust in institutions.

With about 18% of the vote, the party is projected to hold a clear plurality in the 150-seat Lower House but will need at least three partners to form a majority coalition.

Jettens is expected to take the lead in coalition negotiations, a process that typically takes months in the Netherlands' fragmented political landscape.

D66 nearly tripled its seat count compared to the last election, buoyed by an energetic campaign and a surge in advertising spending. Meanwhile, Wilders' PVV lost much of the momentum that had propelled it to a surprise victory in 2023, despite a late surge in the count that briefly suggested another upset.

""I think we've now shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message for your country,"" Jetten said.

All major centrist and left-wing parties had ruled out entering a coalition with Wilders, citing his hardline anti-immigration stance and previous calls to ban the Quran. Wilders said he would still demand the first opportunity to form a coalition if his party had won the most votes.

Final confirmation of the result is expected Monday, once mail ballots from Dutch citizens living abroad are counted.

Wilders triggered the election by withdrawing the PVV from a fragile four-party government after a dispute over immigration quotas and family reunification rules, a move that fractured the coalition and forced an early vote.

His performance in the European Union's fifth-largest economy will be watched as a gauge of how far-right parties are reshaping European politics, with nationalist movements also topping polls in France, Germany, and Britain.

The onetime prince Andrew has experienced consequences for his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. In the US, calls to release the files of the trafficking investigation into the deceased financier and sex offender continue.

Warning: This article contains references to death by suicide, sexual assault and other details that readers may find disturbing.

The brother of British King Charles, Andrew, was relieved of his remaining royal titles because of his connection to late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew previously resigned from all royal duties; now, he won't be a prince anymore either, just Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. He will also have to move out of his current residence, the Royal Lodge. Andrew has been accused of sexually abusing a girl he met through Epstein. Though he arrived at a settlement agreement with his accuser a few years ago, the former prince continues to deny wrongdoing.

In the United States, President Donald Trump can't seem to get away from the Epstein case either.

Epstein, a former investment banker, sexually abused and trafficked girls and young women for years and made them available to friends and business partners, as well. The Epstein scandal had a huge impact on high society in the US, where many elite politicians, businesspeople and power brokers socialized with Epstein. In 2019, Epstein died by hanging off the side of his cell bed, while awaiting trial.

Over six years later, the Epstein affair has become a major pain for Trump. Members of the general public and opposition politicians are demanding that the US Justice Department release the so-called ""Epstein files"" in full. Some of the files are publicly accessible, but many sections have been redacted.

Survivors of Epstein's abuse are demanding that everything the authorities know be made public and that anybody who was part of Epstein's sex trafficking network, or who participated in the sexual abuse, be held accountable.

Trump was very clearly friends with Epstein in the 1990s — there are plenty of photos and videos around to prove it. In a 2002 interview with New York magazine, Trump called Epstein ""a great guy"" and said ""he's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

The men fell out socially in 2004. In 2023, Trump himself was found guilty of sexually abusing the author E. Jean Carroll in 1996, and has tried to distance himself from the whole Epstein affair since the allegations of abuse came to light.

But interest in the case remains high. It is noteworthy that not only members of the opposition party, the Democrats, are calling for a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bill that would require the Department of Justice to publish all unclassified records related to the investigation. Some members of Trump's own party, the Republicans, also believe this is necessary.

""Congress must choose. Will you continue to protect predators, or will you finally protect survivors?,"" Lisa Phillips, a survivor of the Epstein abuse, said on the steps of Capitol Hill in Washington earlier this year. ""Transparency is justice. Release the files, end the secrecy and stand with us in declaring that no one, no billionaires, no politicians, no world leader, is above the law.""

At the moment, there's nothing really happening with the official Epstein investigation. Due to the ongoing US government shutdown, the House Oversight Committee, the main investigative body of the US House of Representatives, isn't working at all.

Information is coming from other sources. On Tuesday, the book ""Nobody's Girl"" was published — a posthumous memoir by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the most prominent survivors of Epstein's sex trafficking network, who accused the UK's Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager.

In April, the then-41-year-old died by suicide. In the book, she writes that Epstein had video recordings of his ""clients"" sexually abusing girls and women.

The memoir has fueled further speculation about Epstein's client list, and whether it might be among the documents that the Justice Department hasn't released.

Trump himself made a campaign promise to release all of the Epstein files — which is why some of his staunchest supporters, members of the Make America Great Again movement, are outraged that he hasn't.



Could it be that Trump is preventing further publication of the Epstein files because they could damage him personally and politically? It's impossible to tell without further examination of the documents. But what one can try to answer is how Trump's supporters might react to possibly damaging revelations.

""Many Democrats hope that the Epstein files might bring Donald Trump down,"" said Ines Pohl, head of DW's studio in Washington. ""But this assumption doesn't match my experience on the ground. Certainly, the vast majority of Republicans and Trump supporters also consider Epstein a despicable criminal. But different rules apply to Donald Trump.""

Pohl has spoken with many Americans about their opinions on the Epstein files and any possible Trump involvement. Most often, the replies she's heard testify to Trump supporters' strong rejection of the political establishment and their unimpeachable loyalty to the man they consider ""their"" president.

They say, ""all of Washington has dirt on its hands,"" Pohl said, so ""why should Donald Trump be held accountable?""

Trump is cancelling billions of dollars in federal funding for congressionally approved projects already underway.

As the federal government shutdown drags on, the Trump administration has doubled down on a tactic of dubious legality that it has been pursuing since January: cancelling federal funding for already congressionally approved projects in blue cities and states.

Back in the summer, the administration pulled $4 billion from the California high speed rail project. It followed up a month later by withdrawing another $175 million from the project. While these cuts alone won't kill off the project, for which California voters have already approved tens of billions of funding through raising bond revenue, they do make it harder for the state to complete vital parts of the rail system. The federal dollars were being used for everything from building stations to constructing viaducts and railway bridges.

In 2019, when Donald Trump 1.0 attempted a similarly destructive maneuver against the high-speed rail system, California sued. Two years later, with Joe Biden as president, the funds were fully restored. This time around, California has sued again, arguing that the deprivation of funds, despite the project having fulfilled all the legally required reviews, is an act of political retribution — and one that puts more than 15,000 jobs on the line. In the meantime, the rail project continues, but with a giant hole in its budget thanks to the Trump administration's efforts at punishing California for opposing the MAGA and Project 2025 agendas.

During the shutdown, Trump has been expanding the punitive model nationally, losing no opportunities to go after big-ticket items in blue parts of the country, and to roll back huge public sector investments contained in Biden's three signature legislative achievements, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS Act. Between them, according to research by Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, these acts created 2.9 million jobs, 70 percent of which were aimed at people without college degrees. The jobs paid about $3 per hour more than equivalent private sector jobs and generated secondary spending in the regions of the country that attracted the most investments. Now, many of these signature public sector investments are on the chopping block, as are many other investments deemed by Trump to be “Democrat priorities.”

In early October, the Army Corps of Engineers put on hold $11 billion worth of water-related projects in a dozen blue states. Subsequently, the corps, falling back on new “Department of War” media guidelines about not releasing non-essential information during a government shutdown, refused to publicly provide details as to which projects had had the pause button pressed on them.

Later in the month, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget put the screws on Illinois by withholding more than $2 billion that had been earmarked for expanding the city's elevated rail system — a massive project aimed at expanding the system into the impoverished far South Side of Chicago, that ground has already been broken on — and by nixing more than half a billion dollars in grants for energy-related projects around the state.

That same week, Trump announced on social media that he was “terminating” the Hudson Tunnel Project — a long-planned project that had garnered a $16 billion commitment from the federal government, to create a second railway tunnel, under the Hudson River, linking New York and New Jersey. That project, too, billed as the nation's largest ongoing infrastructure project, is already underway, and its completion has now been put into doubt by Trump's erratic politics-by-social-media-post behavior.

Compounding the damage to blue states, the administration also yanked billions of dollars in funding for clean energy projects around the country. All but one of the states that lost this money were blue states; the one outlier was New Hampshire, whose Republican governor was on Trump's shit list because she had stood up to him when he ordered red states to implement mid-decade redistricting to try to predetermine the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections.

This game of raw power politics comes with a high cost. Yanking dollars from projects that are already underway means putting large numbers of jobs at risk.

This game of raw power politics comes with a high cost. Yanking dollars from projects that are already underway means putting large numbers of jobs at risk — both the jobs of those working directly on the impacted projects and the secondary ones that are generated when those federal dollars circulate through local economies.

Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that at least 11,000 people are currently working on the New York–New Jersey tunnel project. Beyond those numbers, however, he believes that at least another 11,000 are in jobs (in the restaurant industry and other service sectors) that would likely evaporate if all of those construction workers no longer had employment and thus income to spend locally. While the disappearance of 22,000 jobs in a metropolitan region with 6 million workers wouldn't in itself trigger a local recession, for the impacted workers those lost jobs could mean dreams shattered and the triggering of financial chaos. “The construction jobs will be very hard to replace,” Baker told Truthout. In a period when the residential and commercial construction industries are already in the doldrums, “They're not going to have an easy time finding other jobs.”

Baker calculates that the cumulative damage done by the cessation of the flow of federal dollars into all of these projects around the country will hit many tens of thousands of workers. Regarding the clean energy projects alone, he believes that somewhere in the region of 50,000 jobs are at risk.

“Every million dollars you pull out, you're going to lose about ten of these jobs,” Robert Pollin told Truthout. “The jobs that replace them won't be the same quality of jobs, because these are good working-class jobs.”

“It's clearly just punitive,” Baker says. While the states have already begun suing to protect their federal dollars, the economist anticipates that there will be different outcomes in different state lawsuits and that eventually it will fall to the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump's financial actions against cities and states that oppose his agenda are constitutional. In normal times, he says, it would be a slam dunk that the Supreme Court would nix this behavior; but, given the hyper-conservative nature of the current Supreme Court majority, three of whom are Trump appointees, he has “no idea how the court will rule,” he says.

“It's clearly just punitive … This is really unprecedented. People on those projects will be laid off.”

It is entirely possible that over the coming year the nation's highest court will greenlight federal actions designed to deliberately economically harm denizens of blue regions of the country. If they do, it's a fair bet that Trump and OMB chief Russell Vought will accelerate their assaults on the economic health, and the income streams, of blue-leaning parts of the country, dismantling still more of the investments generated by Biden-era legislation. 

“These are large amounts of money for local economies,” Thomas Palley, a D.C.-based economist who publishes the Economics for Democratic and Open Societies newsletter, told Truthout. “It's a big deal for local economies. This is really unprecedented. People on those projects will be laid off. There are material consequences to people who have businesses reliant on government contracting. And there's an uncertainty impact. People will put plans for business expansion on hold. People will be taking precautionary steps.”

At some point, Palley says, if the squeeze on blue states gets too extreme, those states might end up trying to respond by finding ways to interrupt the transfer of payments from state taxpayers to the federal government. But, until then, he says, everyone's at the mercy of “the clown with the razor blade; he's willing to run around and slash people.”

Critics warn the DHS database could wrongly flag citizens as noncitizens, risking voter access and trust.

The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver's license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship.

The plan, outlined in a public notice posted Thursday, is the latest step in an unprecedented Trump administration initiative to pool confidential data from varied sources that it claims will help identify noncitizens on voter rolls, tighten immigration enforcement and expose public benefit fraud.

According to emails obtained by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, DHS approached Texas officials in June about a pilot program to add the state's driver license data, but it's not clear if the state participated.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Earlier this year, DHS added millions of Americans' Social Security data to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system, allowing officials to use the tool to conduct bulk searches of voter rolls for the first time. According to the document filed Thursday, SAVE also recently expanded to include passport and visa information.

Incorporating driver's license information would allow election officials whose rolls don't include voters' Social Security numbers to conduct bulk searches by driver's license number. Ultimately, the system would link these two crucial identifiers for the purpose of citizenship checks, said Michael Morse, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

“It is the key that unlocks everything,” Morse said.

State driver's license databases often include a variety of sensitive information on drivers, including place of birth, passport number, biometrics, address, email and employment information, said Claire Jeffrey, a spokesperson for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.

Beyond the privacy concerns this creates, using driver's license numbers in SAVE could lead to citizens being wrongly flagged as noncitizens, said Rachel Orey, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Driver's license numbers are sometimes reused and people can have licenses in multiple states. Also, if SAVE isn't linked to live versions of state driver's license databases, the information in the system will be outdated.

“This could have far-reaching consequences for voter access and public trust if inaccurate data were used to question eligibility or citizenship,” Orey said.

DHS says in the notice that linking to driver's license data, which it calls the most widely used form of identification, “will allow SAVE to match against other sources to verify immigration status and U.S. citizenship, which will improve accuracy and efficiency for SAVE user agencies.”

The department did not respond to questions about the expansion.

Up until this year, SAVE was mostly used to check individual immigrants' citizenship status when they applied for public benefits. DHS has said the aim in expanding the system was to enable election officials to check voter rolls en masse. But the agency's data-sharing agreement with the Social Security Administration as well as Thursday's disclosure make clear that DHS and other agencies can use SAVE for other purposes, including for immigration enforcement investigations.

Information uploaded into the system by state and local election officials and other users will be saved and may be “shared with other DHS Components that have a need to know of the information to carry out their national security, law enforcement, immigration, intelligence, or other homeland security functions,” the notice explains.

Advocacy groups have sued the federal government claiming the pooling of data in SAVE violates the Privacy Act, which is meant to prevent misuse of private data. In filings, the government has said that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that DHS would exercise caution in flagging voters as potential noncitizens.

Some privacy lawyers called DHS' move to add driver's license information more evidence of federal overreach. “The administration wants to get as much data as it can, however it can, whenever it can,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

The DHS notice, known as a system of records notice, allows for public comment on several aspects of SAVE's expansion, including some already completed. Typically, such notices are filed when agencies propose changes to federal systems, and the comments are meant to inform how officials go forward. That didn't happen in this case.

In June, email records show, DHS asked the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver's licenses and ID cards, to partner on a pilot program to add its data into SAVE.

Timothy Benz of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE, wrote that the planned expansion was part of the “evolution” of SAVE into a “one-stop shop for all election agency verification needs.”

“That would require collaboration with each states' DL agency in order for us to query those DL records in order to provide that information to the querying elections agency,” Benz wrote.

Rebekah Hibbs, a supervisor in the Texas Department of Public Safety's driver's license division, replied that DPS is “always happy” to support the SAVE tool and agreed to talk again with USCIS.

It's not clear what happened next. In response to questions from ProPublica and the Tribune, DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said the “department does not have any ongoing projects with USCIS related to driver record information for registered voters, nor have we been asked to provide that information.”

She did not answer questions about whether DPS has given any data to USCIS. DHS did not respond to questions about whether the partnership moved forward.

Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced Oct. 20 that her office had run the state's entire voter roll through SAVE. Alicia Pierce, Nelson's spokesperson, said the office did the check using full Social Security numbers, which it routinely obtains from the Department of Public Safety to match with registered voters.

The results showed that around 0.015% of Texas voters, or 2,724 people, are potentially noncitizens.

At least one Texas official is concerned that those initial SAVE results may not be accurate. In a court filing submitted Wednesday as part of the Privacy Act litigation, Travis County voter registration director Christopher Davis wrote that state data shows about 25% of the voters that SAVE flagged as potential noncitizens in the county had provided proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

“I am concerned that the list Travis County received from the Secretary of State is flawed and worry about the potential for voters to be improperly cancelled from the voter rolls and possibly disenfranchised as a result,” Davis' filing says.

            A cryptic reference to “pumpkin day.” An online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack. A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.
    


            A potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel.
    


            Details of the alleged plot are scarce but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about the “pumpkin day” reference, the online chat and the shooting range activity.
    


            Here's what we know and don't know about the potential terror attack:
    


FBI says it thwarted a potential terror attack



            Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Their ages range from 16 to 20s.
    


            Patel wrote on X the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”
    


            “The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.
    


            An attorney who said he is representing one of the adults in custody urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, attorney Amir Makled said.
    


            “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty' event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.
    


            “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.
    


            The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that's harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.
    


            The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.
    


            An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.
    


            “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.
    


            The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.
    


            It's not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.
    


            Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we're told is ‘pumpkin day' – a possible reference to Halloween.”
    


            The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.
    


            There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.
    


            The FBI's Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.
    


            “There is no current threat to public safety.”
    


            The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”
    


            “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.
    


            In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.
    


            She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.
    


            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.
    


            “I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”

            The government shutdown is on the verge of becoming the longest in US history — and lawmakers still have no idea how much longer it will go.
    


            In Washington, senators left town for the weekend deadlocked and more frustrated than ever, while critical safety net programs could soon lose federal funding for the first time.
    


            Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he'd instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”
    


            But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be a partial and short-term fix. Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.
    


            And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.
    


            “Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you've got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”
    


            “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you're going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they've depended on now is gone, because we can't even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.
    


            Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.
    


            And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.
    


            “There's going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.
    


            “I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”
    


            Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats' biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.
    


            “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they're not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.
    


            Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.
    


            As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.
    


            “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?' Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it's a little unusual.”
    


            Many House lawmakers concede they don't know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.
    


            Democrats also pointed to Trump's late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.
    


            In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won't do what's best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.
    


            That includes Trump's resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.
    


            Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders' offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I'm not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”
    


            White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won't be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.
    


            “Let them open up the country, and we'll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We'll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”
    


            But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration's recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.
    


            Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.
    


            Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option.
    


            Still, the behind-the-scenes activity offers a window into the increasing urgency to end the shutdown before more pain hits Americans across the country — and the lingering concern within the administration over which side will bear the brunt of the political fallout.
    


            In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it's also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.
    


            “The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”
    


            Within Trump's orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.
    


            Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won't last much beyond Tuesday's elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, insist it's Trump who needs to offer them one.
    


            “We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president. He spent an hour on this, as far as I could tell, in a month. An hour. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A federal judge is poised to rule on the fate of the National Guard in Portland. Here's what the trial revealed","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/portland-national-guard-deployment-trial","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 09:00:01 GMT","


            A trial to decide the fate of the National Guard deployments in Oregon concluded Friday, leaving Portland residents, Trump administration officials and hundreds of soldiers in limbo as they await the judge's decision.
    


            US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland's ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.
    


            The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn't know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests.
    


            As Oregon and California challenge the effort to send 400 soldiers from their states to the facility, federal attorneys argued during the trial it's within Trump's presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.
    


            But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon's sovereignty in the state's history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.
    


            “The government cannot create the very emergency they propose to resolve,” Oregon attorney Scott Kennedy said.
    


            Troops have so far been barred from deploying due to two temporary restraining orders from Immergut: one blocking troops from Oregon and another blocking troops from any state. The former order is temporarily on hold after being appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
    


            Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom Trump appointed during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. The decision is expected to draw a quick appeal from the losing side.
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state.
    


            As the case played out, Immergut issued an initial restraining order on October 4 blocking the deployment. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.
    


            Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.
    


            The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers' presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.
    


            “The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”
    


Supreme Court wants more time and information before deciding if Trump can send National Guard to Chicago



            “I don't think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge's ruling.
    


            Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn't vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.
    


            “Doesn't that seem odd?” she asked.
    


            Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”
    


            “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.
    


            The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.
    


            Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.
    


            A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.
    


            “I was surprised,” R.C. said.
    


            “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?'” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.
    


            “Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about Trump's claim that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.”
    


            A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland's ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment.
    


            Acting Major General Timothy Rieger said the only direct information he had regarding conditions on the ground in Portland were from the media and other anecdotal accounts.
    


            “You don't know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf.
    


            “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied.
    


            Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense's office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump.
    


            Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs.
    


            Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements.
    


            Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said.
    


            While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon's attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled.
    


            The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility.
    


            The tense June 14 protest resulted in a riot declaration by Portland police, and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey.
    


            During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began.
    


            There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.
    


            R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.
    


            Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.
    


            “Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”
    


            He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.
    


            Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.
    


            Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump's lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.
    


            Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city's sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.
    


            “We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.
    


            Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland's participation with agencies using such munitions.
    


            The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.
    


            Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.
    


            “We simply didn't see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.
    


            That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”
    


Appeals court will reconsider decision that allowed Trump to deploy National Guard troops to Portland



            That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”
    


            The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”
    


            The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.
    


            “Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response.
    


            “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.
    


            Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”
    


            The government also dismissed the state's claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.
    


            “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.

            President Donald Trump's request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.
    


            US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.
    


            She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.
    


            “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.
    


            She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”
    


            Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue.



            The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.
    


            In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump's attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”
    


            A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.
    


            While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.
    


            Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.
    


            In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.
    


            Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.
    


            The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump's order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.
    


            Other lawsuits against Trump's election executive order are ongoing.
    


            In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump's executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The first sign something was amiss was the thwack of helicopter rotors overhead, followed by screams. Within moments, Anabel Romero was on the ground with her hands restrained behind her, she said, as law enforcement officers brandishing guns removed her 14-year-old daughter from a nearby truck and zip-tied the teen while her young siblings looked on.

Romero and her daughter, both U.S. citizens, were among about 400 people detained for hours at a privately owned race track about an hour west of Boise as part an FBI-led investigation into illegal gambling that resulted in more than 100 arrests, nearly all for immigration violations. 

Romero isn't sure what agency the officers who zip-tied her daughter were from. More than 200 officers from at least 14 agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol, as well as local police, participated in the raid at La Catedral Arena. 

The Oct. 19 operation is a striking example of how immigration has become a major driver across federal law enforcement, demonstrating a previously unheard of level of coordination to address President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda. It also shows how immigration dragnets marked by a heavy use of force have entangled U.S. citizens and legal residents. 

The raid on La Catedral Arena struck nerves in Canyon County, which has the most Hispanic residents in Idaho and where Trump got 72% of the vote last year.

Five families interviewed by The Associated Press said officers zip-tied children as young as 11. They said an 8-year-old boy got glass in his mouth as he screamed while officers broke his car window. Several children were separated from family members for hours.




Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees Border Patrol and ICE, denied that children were zip-tied. FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker initially said no restraints or rubber bullets were used on children but later amended that statement, replacing “children” with “young children.”

Four people at the track, and a fifth the next day, were arrested on gambling charges, while 105 others were detained on immigration violations. 

John Carter, a track security guard, said he was placed in zip ties and lost circulation in his hands before an FBI agent loosened them. Carter said officers used flash-bang devices, pointed guns at people, and deployed a pepper bomb in a vehicle where someone tried to hide.

“It's OK to take your family to a public event. Just because there's 10 people in a crowd doing something illegal, that doesn't make everyone in that crowd illegal,” Carter said. “Yes, I voted for Trump, I'm not ashamed to say it. But I don't like the way this was handled and the claims they are making.”

FBI Special Agent Jacob Sheridan said in court documents that the people charged worked on a pari-mutuel betting operation, although the track did not have a state license for that, only for horse racing. 

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokeswoman, said, “ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation.” However, court documents make no mention of animal fighting. She later added that ICE did not restrain or arrest children.

Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said in a joint statement that it was “completely false” and “deeply misleading” for ICE to take credit, noting the FBI's leadership and the involvement of a local task force.

Other examples of how immigration has become a focus in anti-crime operations include a sting involving the FBI in October that targeted illegal street vending in Manhattan's Chinatown, as well as recent efforts in Memphis, Tennessee. During Trump's law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., touted as focusing on crime, about 40% of the first 2,300 arrests were immigration-related.

During the Idaho operation, many officers did not appear to have any identifying marks or department names on their uniforms. Some wore masks. State and local agencies either denied restraining children or did not return calls seeking comment.

Several people told the AP that ICE officers removed their restraints once they were put in line for immigration processing, and court documents say ICE was brought in after the initial search warrant was executed. 

Romero said that when she was unnerved about being separated from her children for hours, an agent laughed and said, “We're taking better care of them.”

Several days later, Romero said her daughter's bruises were still visible. Her 6- and 8-year-old woke up screaming each night. When the family drove past a police cruiser, her youngest “freaked out.”

“They don't even see law enforcement anymore with respect,” she said. “They're pretty shook up.”

Jehidi Perez, 21, of Nampa, was in her truck with her 5-year-old son, watching as authorities tried to break a window of a separate vehicle her parents and 8-year-old brother were in. Her parents started to drive away, and an officer shot at their car.

“It was a rubber bullet, but at the time everybody was panicking. We were thinking that it was actual bullets,” Perez said. “My mother covered my brother with her body.”

Her parents stopped their car, and officers shattered a window. Glass covered her brother — some went into his mouth, Perez said. A rubber bullet struck her father's chest.

ICE arrested her father, and Jehidi Perez was ordered to appear in immigration court in November. 

Her son and her brother, both U.S. citizens, are struggling, she said.

“They can't really get much sleep at night. They are not doing good at all,” she said. “My brother cries every day. This is the first birthday he's spending without his dad.”

When an officer zip-tied Jasim Duran-Villa's 11- and 15-year-old brothers, she urged him to double-check with his superiors.

“We did tell them that we didn't think that was something that they should be doing to minors,” she said. The officer told her other children had been restrained.

Duran-Villa wasn't zip-tied because she was carrying her 14-month-old child. The baby was hungry and needed a diaper change, but the milk and diapers were in her car. 

“Already like 2 1/2 hours had passed, and that's why I was asking so many times, ‘Can I go get my diaper bag to get my baby some milk?' They kept ignoring me, or saying to ask another officer,” she said. “The baby was crying the whole time.”

After more than three hours, they were identified as citizens and allowed to leave. Duran-Villa's father was arrested and charged with an immigration violation.

Juana Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, said law enforcement agents zip-tied her hands behind her back for almost four hours while her 3-year-old son clung to her legs. 

“They would just tell him, ‘You need to hold your mom's shirt.' When he would go a little away from me, they would push him back to me and say, ‘Keep him with you!'” Rodriguez said.

She was eventually allowed to leave, and ICE arrested her father.

“I told him not to sign anything because I'm working to get him out,” she said.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces hit an important fuel pipeline in the Moscow region that supplies the Russian army, Ukraine's military intelligence said Saturday, as Russia kept up a sustained campaign of massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

The operation was carried out late Friday, according to a statement on the Telegram messaging channel. The agency, which is known by its acronym HUR, described it as a “serious blow” to Russia's military logistics.

HUR said its forces struck the Koltsevoy pipeline, which spans 400 kilometers (250 miles) and supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow.

The operation, which targeted infrastructure near Ramensky district, destroyed all three fuel lines, HUR said.

The pipeline was capable of transporting up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel and 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, HUR said. 

“Our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,” said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR, referring to international sanctions on Russia imposed over its all-out war and the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 




Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces defeated a team of Ukrainian special forces that were rushed to the eastern front-line hot spot of Pokrovsk in a bid to stop Russian troops from pushing farther into the city. 

It later posted videos showing two men it said were Ukrainians who surrendered in the embattled city. The videos show the men, one dressed in fatigues and the other in a dark green jacket, sat against a peeling wall in a dark room, as they speak of fierce fighting and encirclement by Russian forces. The videos' authenticity could not be independently verified, and there was no immediate public comment from Kyiv on the Russian ministry's claims. 

Russia and Ukraine have presented conflicting accounts of what is happening in Pokrovsk, a key Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed last week that his forces had encircled the city's Ukrainian defenders. 

But Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that while the situation in Pokrovsk remains “hardest” for Ukrainian forces, who are trying to push Russian troops out of the city, there is no encirclement or blockade as Moscow has maintained. 

“A comprehensive operation to destroy and push out enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing. The main burden lies on the shoulders of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, particularly UAV operators and assault units,” Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged on Friday that some Russian units had infiltrated Pokrovsk, but insisted that Ukraine is weeding them out.

Zelenskyy said that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Donetsk in a major push to capture the city and claim a major battlefield victory. 

Putin is trying to persuade the United States, which wants him to seek a peace deal, that Ukraine can't hold out against Russian military superiority. He has also stressed what he says is Russia's improving nuclear capability as he refuses to budge from what he says are his country's legitimate war aims.

A key goal for Moscow has been to take all of Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, made up of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. Kyiv still controls about a 10th of the coal-rich region. 

Elsewhere, a civilian died and 19 more were wounded, including a 9-year-old girl, when Russia struck the southern Mykolaiv region with an Iskander ballistic missile on Saturday morning, local official Vitaliy Kim said. 

Another Russian strike early Saturday sparked a fire at a gas plant in the central Poltava region, Ukraine's emergency service reported. 

The strikes came as Russia pressed large drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, bringing power outages and restrictions across the country earlier this week in what Kyiv described as a “systematic energy terror.”

Moscow launched 223 drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, 206 of which were shot down, according to the Ukrainian air force. Seventeen struck targets in seven Ukrainian regions, the air force said, without providing details.

Russia also hit an agricultural enterprise in Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, injuring a 66-year old woman, according to a Telegram update by regional government official Viacheslav Chaus.

Russian forces during the night shot down or intercepted 98 Ukrainian drones over the country, including six on the approach to Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday. 

There were no immediate reports of casualties, but local authorities reported a rare large-scale power outage in a Russian city of over 100,000 people. The municipal administration of Zhukovsky, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Moscow, in a Telegram update blamed the blackout on an “automatic equipment shutdown.”

TORONTO (AP) — A two-run lead was starting to slip away from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ninth inning — along with their chance to force the World Series to Game 7.

And then Kiké Hernández turned what might have been a tying, two-run single by Andrés Giménez into the first game-ending left field-to-second base double play in postseason history.

“The crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was because it was in the lights the whole time,” Hernández said after preserving a 3-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 6 on Friday night.

Instead of getting a World Series-winning, three-run homer like the one Joe Carter hit off Philadelphia's Mitch Williams to capture the title in Game 6 in 1993, the Blue Jays were pushed to Game 7 and the Dodgers kept alive their chance to become the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees.

Max Scherzer will start Game 7 for Toronto against a Dodgers pitcher still to be determined — perhaps two-way star Shohei Ohtani, perhaps Tyler Glasnow. The October Classic will end in November for the 10th time.

“It's the two best words in sports: Game 7,” Toronto manager John Schneider said.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto beat Toronto for the second time in a week by allowing one run in six innings, and slumping Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in a three-run third against Kevin Gausman that included Will Smith's go-ahead double. 




George Springer, back after missing two games with a sore right side, hit an RBI single in the bottom half, and the Dodgers held that 3-1 lead going to the ninth.

Roki Sasaki hit Alejandro Kirk on the left wrist with an 0-2 splitter leading off and Addison Barger followed with a drive that landed at the base of the left-center wall. In a seldom-seen rarity, the ball lodged there instead of caroming back into play.

Both runners crossed the plate as many in the Rogers Centre crowd initially thought Toronto had tied the game, but the rule book is clear that a ball lodged in a fence is a ground-rule double. The runners were placed at second and third, and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts brought in Glasnow, who was lined up to start Game 7 on normal rest.

“I just felt that Roki wasn't as sharp, and I just felt we needed some swing-and-miss and Glasnow was the guy. So I had him loose, kind of looming,” Roberts said.

Glasnow escaped with just three pitches, earning the first save of the Series.

Ernie Clement popped up his initial offering to first base. Giménez took a ball and hit the next 247 feet to the opposite field, in short left.

Hernández said he decided to play more shallow than the Dodgers' scouting card called for. He ran 52 feet and while on the run made a catch that had only a 40% probability, then delivered a one-hop throw to second baseman Miguel Rojas that doubled up Barger.

“For a split second as Glasnow threw the ball, the crowd got quiet and I was able to hear that the bat broke,” Hernández said. “So I just got a really good jump on the ball and I came in and halfway there, the ball got in the lights. And I was just like, not the right time to stop to see where the ball is, just keep going.

“It's going to hit me in the face — but I'm not stopping,” Hernández remembered thinking. “I'm not pulling up. And at the very end, the ball came out of the lights and went into my glove.” 

Barger had gotten about halfway to third before scrambling back, and he reached second base too late with his headfirst slide.

“I was being too aggressive, trying to score, try to tie that game if that ball drops,” Barger said.

Even after the umpire signaled out, players had to wait 60 seconds for the call to be upheld by the replay room in New York.

Rojas had been inserted into the lineup for his first start since Oct. 6 in an effort by Roberts to spark the Dodgers' offense, which is batting .191 after winning with just four hits.

“Pretty epic ending there,” Rojas said.

Yamamoto was not quite as sharp as in his Game 2 four-hitter, the first World Series complete game in a decade. Rookie reliever Justin Wrobleski struck out Giménez to strand a runner at second in the seventh and Sasaki got out of a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth when Bo Bichette fouled out and Daulton Varsho grounded out.

Then came the first game-ending double play in World Series history in which an outfielder had a putout or assist, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

“Man, we live for Game 7, so here we go,” Roberts said.

Yamamoto, winner of three MVP awards in Japan, improved to 4-1 with a 1.56 ERA in five postseason starts and has a 1.20 ERA in his two Series outings. 

Tommy Edman doubled with one out in the third for the Dodgers' first hit. Ohtani was intentionally walked for the fifth time in the Series and Smith hit an RBI double off the left-field wall on a high splitter. Freddie Freeman walked, bringing up Betts.

With Los Angeles seeking its third title in six seasons, Roberts dropped the slumping Betts from second to third in the batting order in Game 5 and then to fourth in Game 6 — the lowest Betts had hit since 2017.

Betts fell behind 1-2 in the count, fouled off two pitches and laced Gausman's third straight fastball between shortstop and third for a 3-0 lead. That ended an 0-for-13 stretch with the bases loaded for the Dodgers that dated to the Division Series.

“He could hit me seventh, I don't care. I just want to win,” said Betts, already a three-time champion. “Whatever we do, however we get there, I'll jump on whoever's back to go. We all get a ring, that's all I care about.”

Scherzer and Glasnow started Game 3, won by the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. A 41-year-old right-hander, Scherzer will become the fourth pitcher to start multiple World Series winner-take-all Game 7s after Bob Gibson (1964, '67, '68), Lew Burdette and Don Larsen (both 1957 and '58). Scherzer allowed two runs over five innings for Washington against Houston in 2019, and the Nationals rallied for a 6-2 win.

BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — From the moment President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly every country, Nik Holm feared the company he leads might not survive.

Terry Precision Cycling has made it 40 years with a product line specifically for women, navigating a tough early market, thin profit margins and a pandemic-era boom and bust. But Holm, the company president, wasn't sure how his operation could pay the tariffs first announced in April and stay in business. 

“We felt like our backs were up against the wall,” he said, explaining why he joined a lawsuit challenging the tariffs that the Supreme Court will hear next week.

Terry Precision Cycling's offices are tucked behind a Burlington, Vermont, coffee shop on a leafy street that bursts into color in the fall. Local accolades share wall space with bike saddles and a color wheel's worth of fabric samples. Orders are shipped out from a warehouse a few miles away. 

It seems an unlikely epicenter for the furor over Trump's tariffs playing out on the trading floors of global market exchanges and in the boardrooms of international corporations.

But Terry Precision Cycling is one of a handful of small businesses that are challenging many of Trump's tariffs Wednesday before the Supreme Court in a case with extraordinary implications for the boundaries of presidential power and for the global economy.

The company is small, but it works with suppliers around the world. It sells cycling shorts manufactured in the U.S. using materials imported from France, Guatemala and Italy. Its distinctive, colorfully printed bike jerseys are made with high-tech material that can't be found outside of China. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Tariffs mean the company has to pay more for all those imports, and without the cash reserves of a big company, it has few choices to make up the shortfall besides raising prices for customers. The bewildering pace of changes in tariffs, especially on goods from China, has made setting prices more like rolling the dice. “If we don't know the rules of the game, how are we supposed to play?” Holm asked. 

The company had to add $50 to one pair of shorts in the pipeline when China tariffs hit 145%, bringing the price to $199. “Name the cost and we can name the price, and then we can backtrack to see who can actually afford it,” Holm said. 

The other companies in the lawsuit he joined are also small businesses, including a plumbing supply company in Utah, a wine importer from New York and a fishing-tackle maker in Pennsylvania.

Holm started working for the company more than a decade ago, taking up cycling in earnest alongside the job. He often rides his bike to work and props it outside his office, alongside the company's designers and salespeople. A thin man with deep-set eyes and side-parted hair, Holm was named president about two years ago as the company started by women's cycling pioneer Georgena Terry was wrestling with a downturn in the outdoor market after the coronavirus pandemic. His normally level demeanor gets animated when he talks about the design of their padded shorts or the level of SPF protection in the jerseys.

“It's all about fit and function, and feeling safe and comfortable,” he said. “That's our foundation, getting people, getting women, riding. More butts on bikes and getting out there.” 

The businesses challenging Trump's tariffs are represented by Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian-leaning legal group usually more aligned with conservative causes. But they say Trump is wrong on sweeping tariffs, which are projected to collect a total of some $3 trillion from businesses over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 

They argue the president is using an emergency powers law that doesn't even mention tariffs to claim nearly unlimited powers to impose and change import duties at will, something no other president has done on such a scale. 

“It is practically what the American Revolution was fought over, the principle that taxation is not legitimate unless it is adopted by the representatives of the people,” said Jeffrey Schwab, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center.

The Trump administration said the law lets the president regulate importation, and that includes tariffs. The president has been vocal about the case, suggesting at one point he might go to the arguments himself — something no other sitting president is recorded to have done. “That's one of the most important cases in the history of our country because if we don't win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled financial mess for many, many years to come,” he said.

The law Trump used for many of his tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, has been invoked dozens of times over the decades, often to impose sanctions on other countries. 

But no president had used it for tariffs until February, when Trump placed duties on China, Mexico and Canada. He said the countries had not been doing enough to stop illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

In April, he unveiled “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners with a baseline of 10% and higher increases for specific countries, though many of those have since been put on hold. Tariffs on China hit 145% at one point but have since come down and are headed to 20% overall under Trump's latest deal with China.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the emergency-powers tariffs. The Supreme Court also will hear two other cases on Wednesday, one from a group of Democratic-leaning states and another from an Illinois educational toy company.

The plaintiffs have won two rounds in lower courts, though the government did convince four appellate judges that the law does allow the president broad power over tariffs.

The high court will now be asked to rule on the scope of a president's authority. The justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power. 

But they have been skeptical of presidential claims of power before, as when Joe Biden tried to forgive $400 billion in student loans under a different law dealing with national emergencies. The court found that the law didn't clearly give Biden the power to enact such a costly program. 

Trump's tariffs, by contrast, are expected to total in the trillions. They're also projected to increase people's bills by about $2,000 per household this year, an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found.

Revenue from tariffs totaled $195 billion by September, more than double what it was the year before — though the government could have to pay back that money if the justices strike down the tariffs. 

Trump has acknowledged that Americans could feel some short-term pain from tariffs but maintained that they'll bring about more favorable trade deals and help American manufacturing. His administration says the tariffs are different from the Biden student-loan case because they're about foreign affairs, an area where it says the courts should not be second-guessing the president.

For the people at Terry Precision Cycling, though, those big-picture political questions were far from their decision to join the lawsuit. Holm thought more about the company's 20 or so employees, its legacy and the women who buy its products out of a love for cycling. 

“If it becomes so unaffordable for them to do it, less can enter into that joy, that freedom of being on a bike,” he said. “It was about surviving this uncertainty.”

Derek Jeter, David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez reacted to a wild Game 6 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays and previewed World Series Game 7.

Two hundred twenty-eight days after the start of the MLB season, it will all come down to one final game.

The Los Angeles Dodgers staved off elimination in miraculous fashion Friday night with an unorthodox double play on a fly ball to left, forcing a Game 7 against the Toronto Blue Jays in Canada on Saturday night, live only on FOX.

For the Blue Jays, their decision on a Game 7 starter is a no-brainer, as Max Scherzer is on regular rest and has been pitching much better as of late.

For the Dodgers, they have a peculiar situation on their hands. Saturday would have been normal rest for Tyler Glasnow, but he was summoned to get the final three outs Friday. It only took three pitches, so perhaps he's good to go. However, there is a catch with Shohei Ohtani.

After Game 6, Roberts said everyone but Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who tossed six innings Friday, was available. Obviously, that includes Ohtani, whose 10-strikeout performance — while hitting three home runs — sent the Dodgers to the Fall Classic.

""Everyone"" also includes Glasnow, who was hardly worked to preserve the save. But due to a quirk in MLB rule, 5.11(b) that essentially was made specifically for Ohtani, he may have no choice but to start.

MLB instituted a rule that if a starting pitcher was in the batting lineup, he could continue hitting despite being taken off the mound. However, that is not the case for relievers. So if Ohtani were to only DH on Saturday, then pitch in relief, they would risk losing Ohtani for the remainder of the game upon his being taken off the mound. In order to keep his bat, he would have to play the field, which he has not done since 2021 — he has just 8.1 innings on the field in his career, all in that season. In turn, a fielder already in the lineup would then be taken out of the game.

DODGERS STAVE OFF ELIMINATION TO SET UP WINNER-TAKE-ALL WORLD SERIES GAME 7

Numerous reports have circulated that the Dodgers plan to start Ohtani, and given the niche rule, it seems like the obvious choice. If Ohtani doesn't have it early, Roberts would have no issue going with Glasnow for length.

As for Toronto, its bullpen appears to be locked and loaded. Kevin Gausman gave the team six innings in a tough-luck loss, and Louis Varland, Mason Fluharty and Seranthony Domínguez combined for just two innings before Chris Bassitt came in for the ninth.

George Springer figures to be back in the lineup after driving in the Jays' lone run Friday, albeit clearly uncomfortable from the injury he suffered in the 18-inning marathon of Game 3.

But Vladimir Guerrero Jr. continued a postseason performance that will be one for the record books, win or loss. He is one hit away from tying Randy Arozarena's record from 2020 for the most hits in a single postseason (his teammate, Ernie Clement, is third).

With a win, the Dodgers would be the first team to win back-to-back titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998 to 2000. It would be the first time in almost 50 years that a team won two straight World Series titles on the road, with the last instance being the Cincinnati Reds in Boston and New York in 1975 and 1976.

As for Toronto, a win would mark their first title since 1993, when Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run. It also would be just the second time since 2014 that the Fall Classic was won by the home team.

Fans certainly felt déjà vu incoming in the bottom of the ninth Friday night, but they have to wait at least one more day.

Despite the interruption, Yamamoto, a winner of three MVP awards in Japan, was unfazed by the incident.

""That's a rare case,"" he said after the game through an interpreter. ""I just didn't like it. But I was allowed to pitch a couple of pitches, and so I maintained my composure.""

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss the peanut allergy study and his new book, 'The Miracles Among Us.'

Early peanut introduction could help to curb allergies in kids, new research suggests.

Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old — instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics — appears to be making a dent in the number of peanut allergy diagnoses, the study published in Pediatrics suggests.

""New onset peanut allergy dropped by 43% in kids under 3,"" Dr. David Hill, M.D., Ph.D., from the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told Fox News Digital.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, THERE ARE MORE CHILDREN IN THE WORLD WHO ARE OBESE THAN UNDERWEIGHT

Hill, one of the study authors, noted that new-onset food allergies overall dropped by 36% in that age group.

Peanuts are one of the primary causes of serious allergic reactions in children. These reactions happen when the body's immune system overreacts to peanuts by producing a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which can lead to anaphylaxis — a severe, sometimes life-threatening allergic response, the researchers noted in a news release.

About 4% of children are affected by these types of food allergies, which can cause hives, difficulty breathing, swelling and vomiting. These symptoms can be immediate and life-threatening, experts told Fox News Digital.

Beyond peanuts, other common food allergens include milk, egg and wheat, according to the report.

Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. Then in 2015, a landmark study — the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial — sparked a change in clinical practice.

The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%.

Based on the LEAP trial, leading organizations in pediatric allergy and immunology revised their guidelines for clinical practice in 2015 and 2017, allowing early exposure to peanuts for high-risk children.

""It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy.""

The guidelines were updated again in 2021, encouraging the introduction of peanut, egg and other major food allergens as early as 4 to 6 months for all children — including those without a history of prior reaction, according to health experts.

""It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy, so if we introduced the foods during that window, you will prevent food allergy,"" Dr. Susan Schuval, chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in New York, told Fox News Digital.

EATING BLUEBERRIES EARLIER IN LIFE COULD EASE ALLERGIES, STRENGTHEN IMMUNITY, NEW STUDY FINDS

""If you wait until after that window, the child will be more predisposed to having a food allergy,"" added Schuval, who was not part of the study.

Hill and his team of researchers focused on the effects of the revised practice guidelines from 2015 and 2017, but did not include the 2021 revisions. They analyzed electronic health records from multiple clinics in several states to determine whether the policy changes were having an effect.

For at least two years after the 2015 guidance, the study found that there was a 27% decrease in peanut allergies and a 38% decrease in food allergies.

Egg allergies were also more prevalent than peanut allergies in this analysis.

After the 2017 guidance change, peanut allergies dipped by 43% and overall food allergies decreased by 36% (compared to the pre-2015 guidance) among children observed for at least a year, the researchers found.

""Everyone has been wondering whether these landmark public health interventions have had an impact on reducing rates of IgE-mediated food allergies in the United States,"" said first author Stanislaw Gabryszewski, M.D., Ph.D., an attending physician in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

""We now have data that suggest the effect of this landmark public health intervention is occurring,"" she added.

After the 2017 guidance change, peanut allergies dipped by 43% and overall food allergies decreased by 36% (compared to the pre-2015 guidance) among children observed for at least a year. (iStock)

Hill told Fox News Digital he's ""hopeful that our findings will help to spread awareness that early allergen introduction is safe and effective.""

While early exposure may not completely eliminate allergies to peanuts and other foods, the drop in rates of food allergy diagnoses is promising, said the researchers. They also emphasized the importance of consistent early introduction in clinical practice settings.

""Our findings have relevance [for] those of us who treat patients [and] those caring for infants — and more awareness, education and advocacy could further increase the positive results we observed in this study,"" Hill said.

Not all parents may be comfortable with these revised guidelines, health experts told Fox News Digital.

Parents are encouraged to discuss any concerns with their pediatrician before introducing potential food allergens. (iStock)

""Not everyone has followed those guidelines, but this is further evidence that this early introduction is effective at preventing food allergies,"" Schuval said.

Future studies are needed to investigate how timing, dosage and frequency of exposure could further protect against food allergies, Hill added.

A historic castle recently hit the real estate market in the United Kingdom — but it's not your typical freehold sale.

Bellister Castle, a Grade I-listed property in Haltwhistle, Northumberland, was recently listed by real estate agency Sanderson Young.

Dating back to the 12th century, the castle has a peel tower, which is its oldest feature. The structure boasts 4,778 square feet in the main castle, with a 1,159-square-foot two-bedroom lodge repurposed from a historic gatehouse.

The castle is said to have been constructed with stone from Hadrian's Wall, a second-century Roman wall designed to protect the northern border of Britannia from the Picts. 

In addition to six bedrooms and three bathrooms, the property also features decorative ceilings, an ornate drawing room and a renovated 19th-century fountain tub.

The estate spans roughly 4.51 acres, including a walled garden, an orchard and pasture — with a magnificent tree-lined driveway leading up to the castle.

The property ""offers a rare combination of modernity and comfort against a backdrop of outstanding historical features,"" according to the listing. 

""Attention to detail is in every aspect, combining all the luxuries of modern-day living set within a superb example of an historic, fortified mansion with rich provenance.""

The estate features nearly five acres of land, including a walled garden, orchard and pasture. (Sanderson Young)

""The rarity of such an opportunity is self-evident and is presented to a superb standard throughout. It is an opportunity for a purchaser to buy into the fabric of England,"" the listing also notes.

The property is being leased by the National Trust — meaning that its next owners won't quite own the property.

Its 120-year lease ends in 2145. The guide price is 2.5 million pounds, or roughly $3.34 million.

A spokesperson for Sanderson Young told Fox News Digital the listing presents a ""very rare"" opportunity to rent a castle leased from the National Trust.

""Most long-term leases are for residential or farm properties, and the lease agreements state that the National Trust will need to be involved in the transfer of the lease,"" the spokesperson said, adding that there may be an opportunity to extend the lease when it ends.

""Owning Bellister Castle provides the opportunity to live in an extraordinary historic building and look after it for future generations,"" added the official.

Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., unveil whistleblower records alleging Special Counsel Jack Smith subpoenaed data from Trump allies and GOP groups in Washington on Oct. 29, 2025.

Republican senators issued a torrent of criticism against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg this week after it was revealed that he had signed off on subpoenas and gag orders issued as part of former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation — though a cursory review of court rules suggests it is far less provocative than lawmakers have claimed.

Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., were among the Republicans who blasted Boasberg as an ""activist"" judge, and Cruz, for his part, suggested Boasberg should be impeached. 

""My assumption,"" Cruz fumed, is ""that Judge Boasberg printed these things out like the placemats at Denny's — one after the other.""

MAJOR PHONE CARRIERS REVEAL JACK SMITH'S SUBPOENAS FOR REPUBLICAN SENATORS' RECORDS

At issue were subpoenas and gag orders issued by former special counsel Jack Smith's team as part of its probe into President Donald Trump's actions in the wake of the 2020 election. 

The redacted documents were made public this week by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

They included subpoenas of phone records for 10 senators and one House lawmaker, and gag orders sent to Verizon and AT&T instructing them not to notify lawmakers of the subpoena. (Verizon complied, but AT&T did not.) 

Both the subpoenas and gag orders were signed by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, according to the newly released documents — a detail that prompted fresh criticism and indignation from some of the Republicans in question, including Cruz, who blasted the investigation in question as ""worse than Watergate"" and a gross violation of prosecutorial powers.

Blackburn blasted Boasberg as an ""activist"" judge. Some lawmakers further argued for his impeachment as a result of his involvement. 

In fact, his role in the process is far from surprising. 

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

Local rules for the federal court system in D.C. explicitly state the chief judge ""must hear and determine all proceedings before the grand jury."" The subpoenas and gag orders signed by Boasberg were signed in May 2023 — roughly two months into his tenure as the chief judge for the federal court.

It's unclear whether Sens. Cruz or Blackburn were aware of this rule, and they did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

But it's also not the first time Judge Boasberg previously noted his oversight of these matters as the chief judge for D.C. — including in the special counsel probe in question. 

Boasberg explained the rule in question in June 2023, when he granted, in part, a request from media outlets to unseal a tranche of redacted documents related to the subpoena and testimony of former Vice President Mike Pence in the same probe. (He explained in a lengthy public memo that he did so because the press movant were seeking record that Pence himself had discussed publicly.) 

Still, the controversy comes as Boasberg has found himself squarely in Trump's crosshairs, after he issued a temporary restraining order in March blocking Trump's use of a 1798 wartime law to deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to a maximum security prison in El Salvador.

Until that point, however, Boasberg had largely avoided making headlines. 

JACK SMITH DEFENDS SUBPOENAING REPUBLICAN SENATORS' PHONE RECORDS: ‘ENTIRELY PROPER'

A graduate of Yale, Oxford University and Yale Law School, Boasberg clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit before joining the Department of Justice as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.

He was tapped in 2002 by then-President George W. Bush to serve on the D.C. Superior Court, where he served until 2011, when he was nominated by President Barack Obama to the federal bench in D.C. in 2011. 

His confirmation vote soared through the Senate with a 96-0 vote of approval, including with the support of Sen. Grassley and other Republicans named in the subpoena. 

Boasberg in 2014 was appointed by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to a seven-year term on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA Court, comprised of 11 federal judges hand-selected by the chief justice. 

Former special counsel Jack Smith, for his part, has since defended his decision to subpoena the Republican lawmakers' phone records, which Fox News Digital reported includes phone records for a four-day period surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

They did not include the contents of phone calls or messages, which would require a warrant, but they did include ""[call] detail records for inbound and outbound calls, text messages, direct connect, and voicemail messages"" and phone number, subscriber, and payment information.

 His lawyers told Senate lawmakers in a letter earlier this month that the decision to do so was ""entirely proper"" and is consistent with Justice Department policy.

Former President Barack Obama called for ""regulatory constraints"" on social media during a conversation in June and said the U.S. should experiment with new forms of journalism. 

The dominant form of media bias against Republicans is bias by commission, when reporters accuse them of committing all kinds of abuses and indignities. They are considered guilty of neglecting the vulnerable in their policies and corruption in their dealings.

Democrats benefit from the opposite: bias by omission. Back in 1992, CBS reporter Betsy Aaron warned: ""The largest opinion is what we leave out. I mean, it sounds simplistic, but I always say worry about what you're not seeing. What you are seeing you can really criticize, because you're smart and you have opinions. But if we don't tell you anything, and we leave whole areas uncovered, that's the danger.""

Watching the broadcast network ""news"" programs this week was often an exercise in noting what they left out. Here are just four examples.

1. The FBI reported a 29-year-old Minnesota man, Tyler Maxon Avalos, now faces one federal charge for transmitting a TikTok post that read, in part: ""Wanted. Pam Bondi, preferably dead,"" and referred to a reward of $45,000. A threat about murdering the attorney general of the United States drew a story Monday on ""NBC Nightly News,"" but ABC, CBS and PBS couldn't be bothered.

BROADCAST BIAS: ON UPSIDE-DOWN TV NETWORKS, ICE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE THE DANGEROUS LAW-BREAKERS

This omission was especially galling on NPR, which often acted as a eager publicity arm for former President Joe Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland. This week, Justice Department correspondent Ryan Lucas appeared all over the network to warn about the dangers of President Trump designating Antifa as a domestic terrorism group. NPR is much more concerned about the work of Antifa than the life of Pam Bondi.

2. The American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley issued a statement to NBC News on Monday saying, ""It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end the shutdown today, no half-measures and no gamesmanship."" That was aimed at Democrats, since Republicans have constantly pushed a clean resolution. NBC reported it online, but it didn't make the nightly newscast. ABC and CBS skipped it that night. PBS gave it 18 seconds.

3. On Tuesday, Oct. 28, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee released its report on the Biden White House staff covering up Biden's mental decline. Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. summarized: ""The Biden Autopen Presidency will go down as one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. As Americans saw President Biden's decline with their own eyes, Biden's inner circle sought to deceive the public, cover-up his decline, and took unauthorized executive actions with the autopen that are now invalid.""

TRUMP HITS ABC, NBC AS ‘FAKE NEWS,' SAYS HE'D SUPPORT FCC REVOKING LICENSES

ABC, CBS and NBC aired nothing. PBS offered a dismissive brief. NPR's ""All Things Considered"" performed an interview, but all it ""considered"" was whether Biden's autopen pardons could be reversed. All the committee's findings, videos and transcripts of powerful Biden White House officials were not explained.

4. On Wednesday, Oct. 29, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley released documents detailing ""Arctic Frost,"" an operation where Biden-appointed special counsel Jack Smith went absolutely overboard in issuing subpoenas to investigate Biden's political opponents, in the guise of a January 6 probe. Smith fired off nearly 200 subpoenas against 430 Republican figures and groups. This came after the Biden Justice Department prosecuted over 1,000 of Biden's opponents who were held responsible in the January 6 riots.

But the broadcast networks who lovingly chronicled whatever Team Biden wanted to underline about Smith's probes suddenly couldn't find anything. ABC, CBS and NBC have aerobically ignored it while they obsessed over Hurricane Melissa and the government shutdown. They had time for stories on a dog falling down a cliff and a monkey getting loose in a toy store, but not Democrats behaving badly.

When Republican committees conduct investigations, it's simply not newsworthy. When then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi concocted a totally one-sided January 6 committee, every minute of every minute was aired live.

Smith fired off nearly 200 subpoenas against 430 Republican figures and groups. This came after the Biden Justice Department prosecuted over 1,000 of Biden's opponents who were held responsible in the January 6 riots.

Ken Starr was demonized by the media as a demented Puritan for overreach investigating President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Smith was uniformly presented as a hero. CNN even documented him making a run to Subway for lunch, because, aw shucks, he's like the common man. So, it's not surprising that when Republicans present evidence of a different narrative, the liberal networks buried it like it was a rotting corpse.

The silliest lie circulating in politics today is that President Donald Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice in an unprecedented way to go after his political opponents. Every educated American who repeats this is a liar. It's outrageous that every elitist TV network in this country tries to defend this lie by suppressing the story about how dramatically weaponized Biden's DOJ was.

Trump administration lawyers are inquiring how the Department of Agriculture can legally tap into contingency funds to keep food stamps rolling during the government shutdown.

Federal judge Jack McConnell in Rhode Island ruled Friday that the Trump administration must use contingency funds to keep Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs subsidized as the government shutdown nears its 32nd day. 

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social Friday evening in response to the opinion, saying federal lawyers “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available,” and that he directed them to get further information.

“I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” Trump wrote.

SNAP benefits were set to expire at the end of the day Friday, leaving the approximate 41.7 million Americans, who use SNAP benefits without access to the means through which they buy food on Nov. 1. McConnell's ruling pointed to a SNAP contingency fund of about $5 billion for the administration to use, though it would not be enough to last the entire month of November.

Trump said that even if the courts provide “immediate guidance” on how to use the contingency funds, “it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.”

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” Trump wrote.

JUDGE RULES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST RELEASE EMERGENCY SNAP FUNDS

McConnell issued his ruling shortly after federal Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts issued a similar ruling that deemed the decision to halt SNAP payments “unlawful.” 

The rulings came just days after dozens of states sued the Trump administration over the Department of Agriculture's decision not to issue November SNAP payments during the government shutdown.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump cannot alter federal voter registration forms to require proof of citizenship, a judge ruled Friday.

Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ruled that only Congress and the states have the power to regulate federal elections. Kollar-Kotelly deemed unconstitutional Trump's March executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national mail voter registration form.

“The first question presented in these consolidated cases is whether the President, acting unilaterally, may direct changes to federal election procedures. Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

The judge is an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. Her ruling came as a judgment in the case brought by several Democratic groups against Trump's executive order titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.”

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson signaled that the current administration will appeal the ruling to a higher court.

“President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections. This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it. We expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” Jackson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

Trump pitched the March executive order as a measure to ensure election integrity. The White House released a fact sheet saying that the order “strengthens voter citizenship verification and bans foreign nationals from interfering in U.S. elections.”

The ruling “permanently” enjoins the Trump administration from implementing Section 2(a) of the executive order, which requires the Election Assistance Commission to require national mail voter registration forms to include “documentary proof of United States citizenship.”

The League of United Latin American Citizens, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, praised the judge's ruling in a statement on Friday.

“From the beginning, LULAC has been at the vanguard of defending the rights of children born in this country,” Roman Palomares, LULAC national president, said in a statement. “Nearly a century of leadership has taught us that when civil rights are threatened, we must act boldly and without hesitation.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) was reported to have yelled and sworn at police officers at the Charleston International Airport on Thursday, according to a police report.

Mace reportedly scolded officers who were scheduled to escort her to her gate, but they did show up at the intended meeting location due to a miscommunication, according to the police report obtained by several outlets, including The New York Post.

The report details that Mace was scheduled to arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, but that she was running about 15 minutes behind schedule. The officers whom Mace requested to escort her to her flight arrived at the curb at 6:20 a.m. and stated that they never saw the make and model of her car arrive. They said that just before 7:00 a.m., they were informed that Mace was waiting at TSA's Known Crewmember entrance.

“Less than a minute later, we arrived at the KCM line, and she immediately began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department. She repeatedly stated we were ‘F***ing Incompetent.' and ‘this is no way to treat a f***ing U.S. Representative,'” the report read.

The report, filed under the Charleston County Aviation Authority Police Department, describes Mace as “very irate” and reads, “She also said we would never treat Tim Scott like this,” referring to the state senator.

Mace's director of operations, Cameron Morabito, released statements arguing there was an increased need for tightened security measures around lawmakers in the wake of the murder of Charlie Kirk and noting her entry into South Carolina's gubernatorial race.

“Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you're leading the race for Governor,” Morabito said.

“We are forced to take the congresswoman's safety extremely seriously. After the world watched Charlie Kirk's assassination, the threats against her have only intensified,” Morabito added. “Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”

Mace has made several postings on X, clarifying details reported in local newspapers about the incident.

“All federally elected officials including Senators Scott and Graham use the same Crew Member Access Point at airports.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney revealed on Saturday that he apologized to President Donald Trump for an Ontario government advertisement shown during the World Series, which featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs as a policy instrument. 

Carney also told reporters that Ontario Premier Doug Ford showed him the advertisement before its release. 

“I told him that for Canadians, it was time to speak, to discuss, to negotiate with the Americans,” Carney said of the incident, “Mr. Ford has made a decision, he is independent, he can do it. But it's not exactly useful.” 

“We generated a conversation that wasn't happening in the U.S.,” Ford said. The $75 million ad was aired in Republican-held House districts in the United States.

Trump, whose presidential campaigns have used Reagan phrases such as “Make America Great Again,” canceled trade negotiations with Canada after seeing the ad pushed by the Ontario government. He also imposed a 10% tariff on the country after the Reagan ad re-aired.

Ford eventually pulled the ad from the air, but continues to defend his actions. He has support from 56% of Canadians, according to a Canadian poll.

The Senate voted to end the national emergency declaration that Trump declared to begin hiking tariffs on Canada. Four Republicans joined Democrats to pass the bill, but it remains largely symbolic as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) has blocked similar legislation before.

The Ronald Reagan Foundation said the ad misrepresented Reagan's remarks. The video presented an edited version of Reagan's speech justifying his tariffs on Japan despite his general support for free trade.

“When someone says, ‘Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs, and sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time,” begins the ad featuring Reagan. 

Trump also halted negotiations with Canada in June due to the country's plan to impose a Digital Services Tax on American tech companies, prompting Canada to decide against collecting those fees.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Republican lawmakers heartily rejected President Donald Trump‘s most recent plan for ending the ongoing government shutdown: getting rid of the filibuster rule.

The shutdown is rapidly approaching the longest in American history, and Trump put forward his filibuster proposal Thursday night, ahead of Saturday's looming deadline to pass a funding bill or risk more than 40 million Americans losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.

“BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD “CRAZY,” THE CHOICE IS CLEAR,” the president wrote on Truth Social late Thursday night. “INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” 

Trump's suggestion comes just days after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) reportedly raised the idea herself on a Republican caucus call where she excoriated other GOP lawmakers.

“I said I have no respect for the House not being in session passing our bills and the President's executive orders. And I demanded to know from Speaker Johnson what the Republican plan for healthcare is,” she wrote in a statement on X, confirming reported accounts of her message on the call.

Still, most Republican Senators had already left for the weekend by the time Trump made his demands on Thursday, and those remaining in D.C. on Friday signaled to reporters they were not seriously considering the president's advice.

Ryan Wrasse, a spokesman for Sen. Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), said in a statement: “Leader Thune's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.”

Thune stated after winning his Senate leadership position that the filibuster rule would not be altered during his tenure as leader.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who has spent the past month blaming Democrats for the current shutdown, similarly told reporters the filibuster is “a very important” legislative “safeguard.”

“If the shoe was on the other foot, I don't think our team would like it,” he stated. “What you're seeing is an expression of the president's anger at the situation. He is as angry as I am and the American people are about this madness, and he just desperately wants the government to be reopened.”

White House officials declined to respond to Republican lawmakers' rejection of Trump's proposal.

The Senate could abolish the filibuster with a simple majority vote, plus Vice President JD Vance serving as the tiebreaker, meaning that the president could only stand to lose four Republican lawmakers and still successfully change the Senate rules.

And beyond Republican leadership, a number of rank-and-file GOP Senators similarly voiced displeasure with the president's proposal.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who has frequently clashed with the White House on legislative matters since January, will “never vote to eliminate the legislative filibuster under any circumstance,” a Tillis spokesperson told Politico.

“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) wrote in a statement on X. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn't. I'm a firm no on eliminating it.”

As expected, Democrats have warned against ending the Senate's filibuster rule as the shutdown extended across October, a position out of fashion with the caucus during much of President Joe Biden‘s term in office.

Democrats unsuccessfully pushed the former president to back ending the Senate rule in order to pass his failed Build Back Better economic spending package, voting rights legislation, and new federal abortion protections.

During a 2021 town hall with CNN, Biden claimed that nuking the filibuster would “throw the entire Congress into chaos, and nothing would get done.” 

Following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in 2022, the president suggested an openness to temporarily altering the Senate's filibuster rule to codify abortion rights but ultimately conceded that Democrats lacked the votes in the chamber to do so.

“I believe we have to codify Roe v. Wade into law. And the way to do that is to make sure Congress votes to do that,” he stated at a press conference while in Madrid, Spain, for a NATO leaders summit. “If the filibuster gets in the way, it's like voting rights, it should be — we provide an exception for this, should require an exception to the filibuster for this action, to deal with the Supreme Court decision.”

However, after Trump's victory in November of 2024, Democrats quickly began retreating from their Biden-era filibuster positions. 

“I'd be lying if I said we'd be in a better position without the filibuster,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told the Washington Examiner at the time. “We have a responsibility to stop autocratic and long-headed abuse of power or policy, and we'll use whatever tools we have available. We're not going to fight this battle with one hand tied behind our back.”

“You play with the rules that exist,” added Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT).

LOOMING SNAP DEADLINE AMPUS UP SHUTDOWN PRESSURE ON BOTH TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) mocked the filibuster flip from Democrats earlier this month.

“We ran on that. We ran on killing the filibuster, and now we love it,” he told reporters. “I don't want to hear any Democrat clutching their pearls about the filibuster. We all ran on it.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The story of William Newsom is one of success and comfort. The father of presidential hopeful Gavin Newsom, William's job was to manage the Gordon P. Getty family trust fund valued at billions of dollars. 

As one would expect, William was well-educated, attending the most expensive institutions in the country, including Santa Clara University as an undergraduate and Stanford Law, before becoming a lawyer, later a judge, and eventually serving at the right hand of one of the wealthiest people in the country, Gordon Getty.  

ON BEING AGAINST THE SOFT BIGOTRY OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR WOMEN

Gavin Newsom would later attend Santa Clara University. Shortly after graduation, he founded PlumpJack Winery. Of course, opening a business in wine country can be extremely costly, but fortunately for Newsom, he was seen as a family member to Gordon Getty, who promptly invested not just in the winery but also in 10 of the 11 businesses the future governor would open while still in his mid-twenties. 

In other words, Gavin Newsom is a man of immense privilege. But that story will not fly in a Democratic primary for president, because this is a party now built primarily on grievance and victimhood. Newsom knows he has to pivot to appeal to the far Left, just as other privileged children, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani, have in portraying themselves as disadvantaged and oppressed. 

And boy, did he ever during a podcast called All The Smoke, which is hosted by former NBA players this week. 

“It was also about paying the bills, man. It was just like hustlin' and so I was out there, kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed,” he said with an accent that appeared to be pandering to his Black hosts. “I was sitting there with the Wonder Bread … the macaroni and cheese. That's how I grew up, bro!” 

If you're cringing right now as you've never cringed before, that's understandable. And it gets worse: “Every day in the backyard, bouncing the basketball, throwing the ball against the wall unit, entertaining yourself. Then this sh***y student, head down, started throwing. The baseball got a little faster. I started making a few free throws, practicing 500 of them every night in high school.” 

It's like Eminem meets Michael Jordan. What a story! 

But according to a report in The Press Democrat, Newsom “spent part of his childhood years in a two-story house with magnificent views of San Francisco. It is currently listed at $3.6 million.” How can that be? 

And you'll never guess who was featured in a 1991 article by the San Francisco Chronicle titled, “Children of the Rich” … Gavin Christopher Newsom. 

Note: Newsom's parents were divorced in 1971. Gavin went to live with his mother, Tessa, in the aforementioned house above. He played sports in high school, which, from experience, doesn't allow for much time to work, or, in Snoop Gov's words, “hustlin'.” 

And if Newsom grew up poor in the heart of San Francisco with magnificent views from his home, why exactly did Gordon Getty swoop in right after college graduation to invest in a winery and nine other businesses? 

According to polls, Newsom is polling at or near the top for the Democratic nomination for president, along with AOC and Pete Buttigieg. To get past both of them in the primary, he's going to have to go even further to the left, if that's humanly possible. 

This may explain why the governor completely shapeshifted his position on the woke movement. 

On All The Smoke this week: “All this anti-woke stuff is just anti-black. Period. Full stop. All this CRT, ESG, DEI stuff, that's all this is. It's this great purge,” 

But this flies in the face of what he told the late Charlie Kirk earlier this year about transgender men competing against biological women in sports. “I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,” Newsom said. “I am not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.”

In the same interview, he called police defunding “lunacy,” dismissed “cancel culture,” and criticized the leadership of the Black Lives Matter organization. 

“Democrats are losing,” he added regarding their stances on cultural issues. “We're toast.” 

But when speaking to a different podcast, like All The Smoke, Newsom shifted back to whatever he wanted the hosts and its audience to hear, calling anti-wokeness “anti-black.” 

Kirk would later write in a Fox News opinion piece that Newsom is a force to be reckoned with, only because of his unrelenting desire to be president. He is betting that voters will simply forget about Newsom's actual actions, or lack thereof, which include his refusal to reverse California's existing policy on men competing in women's sports. In July, Trump's DOJ announced it was suing California as a result. “Unsurprisingly, Newsom is charming and friendly in person. You don't become governor of 40 million people without having some charisma,” Kirk noted. “But there's clearly a layer beneath the charm. I saw that Newsom wants to be president more than any living person (and possibly every dead person, too).”

“The governor isn't a joke. He has a shark's instincts and is hoping that voters will have a goldfish's memory,” he added. 

So, Newsom's plan is simple: run hard to the Left in the primary because moderates don't have the same level of enthusiasm as the Left. New York City's mayoral race is a prime example, with a Communist likely becoming the leader of the world's financial capital. And to Kirk's point, Newsom has the ambition and the ability to conform to any position based on the polling and public mood, hypocrisy be damned. 

Speaking of hypocrisy, this isn't anything new for Newsom, either. No one in the country was more draconian with mask mandates and business closures than California. But there was a maskless, unvaccinated Newsom at the ritzy French Laundry, a long way from the poor Wonder Bread days, in wine country during 2020, laughing it up with other rich folks as businesses went bankrupt and children became depressed from being isolated from their classmates. 

And who could forget the Super Bowl in February 2022, when a maskless Newsom was taking photos with celebrities at the indoor stadium while Newsom was STILL imposing a mask mandate at all California public schools. 

Will he be the Democratic nominee? He has as good a shot as any, although privileged, rich white guys may not ultimately fly with the current Democratic Party. But if that does happen, ask yourself this: 

TRUMP'S MIDDLING EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE MILITARY

Could you honestly see steel workers in Pennsylvania, auto workers in Michigan, farmers in Wisconsin, hotel and restaurant service workers in Nevada, those who care about the border in Arizona, or Independents in North Carolina and Georgia embracing a slick California elitist with no moral compass in a general election? 

He has the same problem as former Vice President Kamala Harris. And if Democrats actually do nominate Newsom, let's just say the bet here is that his lifelong dream of being Celebrity-in-Chief at 1600 will not be realized. 

Because nobody likes a phony. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The government has abandoned its commitment to an equitable education for all children—if it ever had one.

The Trump administration has taken the government shutdown as an opportunity to end federal oversight of the education services offered to more than 8 million children with disabilities in America. Last month, the Department of Education attempted to fire nearly every staff member left at the Office of Special Education Programs—an action now stuck in litigation. The department had already canceled millions of dollars in grants to provide teacher training and parental support for students with disabilities, and it is now “exploring additional partnerships” to move special-education services elsewhere in the government. Ostensibly, these cuts and administrative changes are part of a broader effort to empower states. But whatever the motive, the result is clear: The government has abandoned its commitment to an equitable education for all children.

This attack did not come out of nowhere. Over the course of five decades, Congress has repeatedly weakened the transformative law that has governed education for disabled students, putting it in the precarious and dysfunctional position it was in when Donald Trump took office.

President Gerald Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act into law on November 29, 1975. It mandated that all children with any form of disability must be provided a free public education and that they be educated alongside children without disabilities “to the maximum extent appropriate.” This landmark legislation has improved the lives of generations of children with disabilities. In 1970, only one in five children with disabilities were educated in America's public schools. Some states had laws explicitly excluding those whom schools deemed “uneducable.” Many of those children spent their lives in institutions. Others were homeschooled or received very little formal education at all. Today, 15 percent of public-school students are served by the law, which was reauthorized and renamed the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act in 1990.

Read: Special ed shouldn't be separate

Although a right to an education is not explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment established that no state can “deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws.” IDEA is an effort to uphold that guarantee. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 called for the racial integration of public schools and other institutions, but it left disability discrimination unaddressed. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 did not require states to educate students with disabilities; it did, however, establish funding grants to states that provided services. The Education of the Handicapped Act of 1970 solidified the core grant program that provides funding to states and school districts and is still part of IDEA today. What is remarkable about IDEA is that it combined tenets from all these precedents. IDEA isn't just a declaration of the right of students with disabilities to an education. It's also a funding policy—a shared financial partnership among federal, state, and local governments—to provide an appropriate public education to all students with disabilities.

For states to follow this mandate, the federal government knew it would need to share the costs  of well-trained teachers, support staff, and the educational equipment needed. In a version of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act introduced in 1972, New Jersey Senator Harrison Williams explained what Congress was taking on. “It is hard to argue to the States that the federal government is serious about full educational opportunity for all handicapped children when we are not willing to invest money to make this goal a reality,” he wrote. “We will have to put our money where our mouth is.”

The law originally said that the federal government would contribute up to 5 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure by 1978 and would increase its share incrementally to up to 40 percent by 1982. But Congress's commitment to funding the law has been tepid since the beginning. Access to education for the nation's children with disabilities was not a priority for Ford, who chose to sign the bill into law without any formal ceremony. In a message accompanying the new law, he admitted that he had signed only reluctantly. “Even the strongest supporters of this measure,” he wrote, “know as well as I that they are falsely raising the expectations of the groups affected by claiming authorization levels which are excessive and unrealistic.” The bill, he believed, was promising more than it could deliver.

Congress's backtracking on its initial commitment began almost immediately. The law had established a maximum authorization of 40 percent, which permitted Congress to perennially allocate less. Funding has fluctuated, but it has never been near that maximum share. From 2004 to 2006, the federal contribution was its highest, at 18 percent. We are now a long way from the partnership that Senator Williams envisioned. Last year, federal funding for IDEA was 10.9 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure.

At the same time that Congress has reneged and reneged, the costs of special education have risen dramatically. As diagnostic practices and screenings have improved in the past 50 years—and as the diagnostic criteria for autism in particular have expanded to include a wider range of symptoms—the number of students served by IDEA has increased. In the past decade alone, the number of students served by IDEA has grown 17 percent. “We're not cutting any of the IDEA funding,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon claimed at a Senate appropriations subcommittee on June 3. Technically, she's right—but that money is covering an ever-smaller share of the nation's costs.

As the federal government cancels funding streams and fires the employees in charge of overseeing special-education programs nationwide, the result will be an uneven, state-by-state patchwork of special education. Kids with disabilities in some states will get the support they need to learn alongside their peers and earn a high-school diploma. Kids in other states will be kept in segregated classrooms without any preparation for a prosperous future when they age out of the public-school system. That future is already playing out across the country to some extent, but it's about to get even worse.

Read: The work of caring for my daughter will never be ‘efficient'

To receive federal funding, each state must submit an annual performance report. This year, more states were labeled “needing assistance” in following IDEA for school-age children and young adults than were “meeting requirements.” Even in states such as Texas that are meeting requirements according to this report, parents fight an uphill battle with school districts to get their kids what they deserve. Carol Caron's daughter, Ellie, has Down syndrome and is in fifth grade in the Aledo Independent School District, near Fort Worth. The district insists that Ellie belongs in a “functional academics” classroom, learning an alternative curriculum that, according to Carol, drastically underestimates what Ellie is capable of achieving. Carol has filed several complaints with the Texas Education Authority about Ellie's placement. She wants Ellie to be educated in a classroom with her nondisabled peers. Among other benefits, this would ensure that Ellie is being appropriately challenged. But the school district has repeatedly refused.

Texas is one of several states with a track record of violating IDEA regulations. In 2018, the TEA submitted to the Office of Special Education Programs and the Department of Education its plan to correct a state-imposed limit that discouraged school districts from identifying more than 8.5 percent of students for special-education services. Texas saved billions by ignoring the medically diagnosed disabilities of tens of thousands of students. By this summer, OSEP had determined that the TEA had removed these restrictions. But without federal staff, there will be no way to continue monitoring compliance in Texas or in any other state.

In response to complaints filed by Carol and other parents, the TEA directed the Aledo School District to review its placement and assessment of students with disabilities, like Ellie. But Carol doesn't believe that the district will change course. “What is practiced is different from what the school district puts on paper,” she told me. “There are no sanctions with teeth.” Carol filed a complaint with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights last spring, but she doubts that her concerns will ever be addressed. Ellie's classroom placement hasn't changed, and without any federal oversight, she is running out of options.

Like Ellie, my daughter, Louisa, has Down syndrome. But we live in Ohio, not Texas, and Louisa's educational trajectory looks remarkably different. Now in eighth grade, she has learned beside peers with and without disabilities since preschool. Ohio is far from perfect; I wouldn't say that it has an exceptional commitment to serving students with disabilities. But Louisa has benefited from a more inclusive and academically rigorous approach to special education than Ellie. With the Office of Special Education Programs a shell of its former self, this disparity—a child's education and future determined by where she lives—will only deepen. It demonstrates how ending federal oversight of IDEA isn't about giving control to the states. It is about denying the civil rights of all students with disabilities. Whether students like Ellie and Louisa have access to education will not be determined by law, but by chance.

The decline of one of America's biggest health crises, in two charts

For years, obesity rates in the US have gone in one direction: up. From the first year it was launched, Gallup's National Health and Well-Being Index has found that the share of US adults reporting obesity has climbed and climbed, rising from 25.5 percent in 2008 to 39.9 percent in 2022. That survey caught the last leg of an epidemic that has been spreading for decades, with estimated obesity prevalence tripling over the past 60 years.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

It's not that the country hasn't tried to fight weight gain. But from the $33 billion Americans spend each year on weight loss products and services to government efforts like first lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign or Make America Healthy Again, little has worked. Many doctors and patients came to believe the rise in obesity may be all but biologically inescapable, despite the grave health risks that accompany it.

But maybe not. According to the latest results from Gallup's survey, self-reported obesity has started to fall, declining by nearly 3 points to 37 percent in 2025. The self-reporting part is an important limitation — people's reporting of their weight tends to be imprecise — and we'll need more definitive proof from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be sure, but it's some of the earliest evidence that the US may finally be turning a corner on one of the biggest health crises of the modern age.

And the main reason it appears to be happening isn't because weight-loss experts have stumbled upon a new diet that always works (we haven't and probably never will) or because we've managed to ban all unhealthy junk food (we haven't and almost certainly never will). It's likely because of the growing use of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, better known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.

What's changed is we now have highly effective weight-loss medicines working at a scale that we've never seen before.

Older weight-loss drugs tended to shave off only a few percentage points of body weight, and they came with tough trade-offs and quick weight rebound. The new drugs, which were originally developed to treat diabetes, are targeting the biology that makes weight so hard to lose and keep off: They dial down hunger in the brain, slow gastric emptying, and improve post-meal insulin signaling. In large randomized trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg — the active ingredient used in medicines like Ozempic — produced about 15 percent average weight loss over 68 weeks when paired with basic lifestyle support. Other combinations have reached as much as 20 percent on higher doses.

Those effect sizes are big enough that, when even a modest share of adults use them, you can start to see movement in the population data. And as further data from Gallup shows, more and more Americans are trying these drugs, with the survey finding that more than 12 percent of adults reported taking them in the second and third quarters of 2025, up from less than 6 percent in early 2024.

And while much of the media coverage around these drugs has focused on weight and appearance, the health benefits seem to go much further. In 2024 the Food and Drug Administration added cardiovascular risk as a reason to be prescribed the GLP-1 drug Wegovy, grounded in results from a major trial that showed fewer heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths in adults with obesity or overweight and established heart disease. The FDA's action also opened a door for Medicare coverage in patients with cardiovascular disease — an early sign that access for these expensive medicines could expand beyond the well-insured.

It's still early days, but if the national obesity curve keeps bending down, the benefits would be enormous. Obesity multiplies risk across nearly every major cause of death; even small, sustained declines in prevalence translate into millions fewer people living with diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, and painful joint disease — and billions saved in medical costs over time. The CDC pegs direct medical spending tied to obesity at roughly $173 billion. Turning that curve even a little would represent significant relief.

But we're a long way from solving this problem. For one thing, as effective as they are, these drugs behave more like statins than antibiotics: They work while you take them. When people stop, weight regain is common.

And GLP-1s do come with side effects that for some patients have been serious enough to lead to discontinuation. Scientists also still aren't sure about some of the longer-term effects of the drugs, which can include muscle loss and changes to sex drives. And don't forget the four-figure monthly side effect on the wallet if GLP-1s need to be paid for out of pocket. Obesity is already linked to lower socioeconomic status, and that disparity could worsen if GLP-1s remain out of reach for all but high-income people.

Chances are, though, that the current generation of GLP-1s is the worst and most expensive we'll ever have. Drug companies are already experimenting with pill forms of the medicine, which would make dosing more precise and lower the barrier to access: as much as 20 percent of the American public has some form of needle phobia (or trypanophobia, for those who want a great Scrabble word).

I'll admit there's something uncomfortable about the idea of solving obesity primarily through a drug. After all, as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fond of saying, can't we fix obesity through healthier food and more exercise? But while our food system could surely be improved and most of us don't get enough exercise, it's not as if we haven't tried, whether as individuals or as a country. The simple fact is that the contemporary environment is one that is heavily weighted toward the obesogenic. GLP-1 drugs seem to offer the best chance to tilt the scales back in our favor.

The world after the AI bubble, explained.

Every tech company now seems to have their own AI: Google Gemini. OpenAI's ChatGPT. MetaAI. Spending for AI is reaching record highs, powering a big boom for the stock market. Even the White House wants in on the fun.

So are we in an AI bubble — an overblown investment period that's bound to deflate? Yes, argues Paul Kedrosky, a partner with SK Ventures and a fellow at MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. But not the bubble everyone thinks we are in. “AI is obviously a hugely important technology,” Kedrosky told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. So what, then?

It's the money going into the AI infrastructure like data centers that concerns Kedrosky: “We're spending this prodigious amount of money on the underlying infrastructure for AI with probably no likelihood of recovering most of that cost, and a significant likelihood that most of those assets become worthless because of the speed at which they depreciate.”

What happens when the bubble pops? And can past bubbles tell us anything about what is to come?

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How much money is going into these data centers?

It's going to be on the order of trillions now. Forecasts are in excess of $2 trillion in data center spending ahead. But an increasing fraction of the money that's being spent on all of these things that allow us to distribute AI, like electricity, is coming from debt. And debt comes with obligations. You don't get to just walk away from it. So that makes this moment even more perilous.

If AI is so important, why does it not make sense for trillions of dollars to be rushing in? Isn't this what we should be doing?

We should be. But the problem, of course, is that there's this idea of what's called a rational bubble. Everybody thinks they're doing the right thing, but when you add everybody's “right thing” together, you end up with a prodigious amount of waste.

It's no different than if you go back to the 19th-century railroad bubbles in both the UK and the US. There was simply too much track, too many enthusiastic railroad builders building almost adjacent tracks to the same locations. And this led to an incredible amount of waste. But it also led to company failures and various market crises across the 19th century in the US and repeatedly in the UK. It's not as simple as saying, “Well, this is important, so we should build it and not care what it costs and not care about the consequences.”

If so many smart people think that we are in a bubble, why is money still flowing into data centers and other AI infrastructure at the rate that it is? 

I'm not convinced that many people think it is a bubble. As I talk to people in technology, the most common response I get is not only is this not a bubble, but it's probably the most important technology of our lifetime. We have an opportunity to build a super-intelligence, a god-like intelligence on top of all of these chips and buildings and this AI electricity thing we're creating. And to say we should slow down at this point, according to the technology community, is just a huge error. But there are people outside of technology who say, “Oh, this is an incredible amount of spending.” The Bank of England said it. Other people are cautioning about it, but not inside of technology.

The United States and humanity broadly has had no shortage of bubbles throughout history. You mentioned the railroads; walk us through some famous American bubbles.

The railroad is probably among the most prominent in the US and that was, again, an enthusiasm for the idea. The same thing happened in the '20s during electrification. In the 1920s we went from a single-digit percentage of rural areas having access to electricity, [to] by the end of the decade it was more or less ubiquitous. Everyone had access to electricity. But at the same time, that gave rise to this proliferation of utility companies, of ventures that were doing all kinds of questionable things in terms of overspending. You could argue that electrification and the frenzy around it gave rise to the stock market rise of the '20s, which led to the crash of '29 and helped precipitate the Great Depression.

People are pretty familiar with the telecom and dot-com bubbles, but the closest historical analogy to what's happening now genuinely is railroads and electrification. In the same way that we don't need to have two sets of tracks to Philadelphia, we probably don't need the same number of companies delivering what are called these large language models, these AI models that people are using. These will naturally shrink.

How destructive are bubbles and what do they tend to destroy?

All of them do immense damage. It's a question of how big the bubble is and where the damage goes.

So if you're just holding an index fund and thinking you're being very conservative, you're actually soaking in AI right now. If everything reverses, goes 20 or 30 percent in the other direction, you're much poorer than you were. That'll change your spending. And that has implications for recessions.

Isn't it always the case that the bubble bursts and then what it leaves behind is, maybe not something beautiful, but something workable?

That's kind of a line of patter from the technology community. But the reality is almost every financial, every technology revolution has caused huge damage and can take decades before we get back to where we were before. And as the famous line in economics goes, in the long run, it may work out, but in the long run we're also all dead.

Patricia Willson, 93, stares intently at her leg as her nurse unwraps layers of bandages, revealing a scar that, to Willson's elation, is nowhere near as gruesome as it had been months ago.

Hunched over from a fractured back, Willson scrolls through her phone to remind her nurse what the scar had looked like. Last December, she sliced her leg open on a box. A few months later, the three-inch gash got infected.

""It scared me so bad when my legs started hurting,"" Willson tells her nurse, as Business Insider visited her home in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, earlier this year.

""You're a medical masterpiece,"" her nurse says. ""You've been through a lot. Did you mention how many times you've broken a bone?""

""Well, I've had 14 broken arms,"" Willson replies.

As she inches back to her desk once her leg is tended to, Willson stops to clear off a stack of papers. Nestled between bills and medical records on one side of the desk sits a stapled-together printout of 50 websites for finding freelance work. Tucked away on the other side is a slightly wrinkled cover letter she's been sending to companies.

""I really need a job,"" she says under her breath.

There aren't too many people her age looking for work, she acknowledges somberly. Willson, a mother of six, worked in payroll at companies like Pfizer before opening a home rental business in 2006, which she runs with her daughter and her son-in-law. Until four years ago, Willson was on her feet doing chores around the property; she has since become less able to perform physical tasks.

""When you don't know what to do, you don't do anything,"" Willson says. ""Things snowballed on me, and I did not foresee that things would get worse.""

She's one of the nearly 1.4 million people over age 65 who have a disability and still work — whether by choice, like some, or by necessity, like Willson, who says that after paying all her bills, she sometimes struggles to have extra money left at the end of the month to buy a full cart of groceries.

Business Insider's ""80 over 80"" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. If you are 80 and older and still work, fill out this form to contribute to the series and read more here:

On a recent group call AARP held about applying for jobs, Willson suspected she was the oldest there by at least a decade. With almost nothing in savings, even with Social Security, she's spent hours each day browsing remote jobs and educating herself on what may be out there, knowing full well that most companies might not consider someone at her age.

Some nights, she says, the stress of her situation keeps her from sleeping.

""I'm worried every night when I go to bed that what I have isn't going to last until I die,"" Willson says. ""For God's sake, I should have saved every penny I could save.""

It's a growing reality that older Americans are increasingly relying on work to make ends meet. Nearly 550,000 were working into their 80s and beyond as of 2023, according to a Business Insider analysis of 2023 Census data. That's over 4% of the population aged 80 and above.

Of the more than 175 people 80 and older who spoke to Business Insider about working later in life, most mentioned some health issue as a challenge. Common ones included arthritis, mobility impairments, heart disease, hearing loss, and memory problems. Most of these didn't prevent them from performing their job tasks.

A few said their conditions were severe enough that they would have retired years ago if they could have, though they need to work to pay their bills. Their health issues have led them to either struggle throughout the day or find employment where they can work around periods of pain.

For four decades, Patricia Moore, 81, has managed a gas station, earning about $36,000 a year despite suffering from neuropathy and swelling. It's exhausting some days, but she has to work to supplement her $2,800 monthly Social Security income, as she doesn't have sufficient savings.

""Retirement is not in the near future, as it costs more every month to just survive,"" said Moore, who lives in California.

The average retirement age in the US is 62, when accounting for people who retire early because of disabilities.

Though much research shows that work prolongs people's lives, some papers suggest that work is detrimental to longevity for those with health issues or who work in physical jobs. Research by Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at The New School in New York, suggests that working later in life benefits those who want to work — and harms those with no choice but to work, especially as mortality risks and stress levels increase.

Business Insider's analysis of Census data found that while many of the most common occupations for Americans 80 and older are less risky, meaning lower incidences of injuries or fatalities, thousands work in higher-risk professions, such as truck driving, personal care, janitorial work, and construction. In interviews, some workers in these professions said that while they mostly enjoy the work, they worry that their health could hinder their productivity — or that working could put their lives in danger.

The entire US population is aging, too, suggesting that older people are more likely to stay in the workforce in the coming years. In a decade, estimates suggest, there will be more Americans 65 and older than below 18 — a flip of the current distribution of age, and a challenge when it comes to keeping an economy growing.

""To offset those pressures on the workforce, people who continue to work into their 80s, beyond conventional retirement ages, help the equation,"" said Nicole Maestas, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, adding that the US has already seen substantial reductions in GDP growth due to an aging population.

With fewer people available to work — and therefore fewer people paying the taxes that fund healthcare benefits — Maestas said companies and policymakers should consider ""how we can take advantage of technology to complement work.""

During the pandemic, companies rushed to partner with health-based advisors and adopt more age-friendly benefits and health-related policies, said Talia Varley, managing director of global corporate advisory at the Cleveland Clinic. Workplaces are now taking more consideration into medical leave policies, physical accessibility, menopause, phased retirement policies, and disability accommodations. Still, she said, there's much to do.

David Hugo Barrett, 82, begins every middle and high school class he teaches with life lessons about the importance of working hard and staying out of trouble. For a few hours each day, he feels young, learning Gen Alpha slang and staying in touch with the latest tech trends.

But when he returns home each night, he's reminded of the disabilities that have made his outlook less stable. He has lymphedema, which leads to swelling in his legs, and peripheral neuropathy, which causes nerve damage in his feet.

""People say age is nothing but a number. That's just simply not true,"" Barrett said. ""Aging is not something that can be taken lightly.""

Barrett works as a substitute teacher in Maryland, having spent decades as a systems engineer and teacher. He retired in 2018 and self-published his memoir, ""A Newark Childhood,"" before returning to work part-time in November 2024. His wife, 74, works as a substitute teacher for elementary school students. Staying retired was not an option, he said.

""The financial part is not insignificant, and I look forward to getting those checks every two weeks,"" Barrett said. ""I wish I had waited until I was older to take advantage of my Social Security. In that calculation of how long I'm going to live with my 401(k), I underfunded it because I've lived way beyond what I expected.""

Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a resident scholar at Brandeis University in Massachusetts who studies aging, said that because people's incomes often peak in their mid-50s, it's much harder to earn an adequate salary in later years — which keeps people employed for longer, even amid severe health challenges.

""Ethically speaking, if we had a good healthcare system in the United States that covered everybody from cradle to grave, we would have more healthy people,"" she said, adding that mid-career ageism can push back people's retirement ages. Additionally, about 26 million Americans under 65 are uninsured, so those who face medical challenges may have to work later to recover medical expenses, she said.

Jane Way, 84, wanted to continue a professional career into her retirement years despite mobility limitations. She's been in a wheelchair for five years.

Way, who lives outside Phoenix, works remotely as the US accountant for a South African orphanage, often logging in early in the morning to accommodate the time zone difference. Everything she needs is nearby, so she considers her health issues ""not a big deal.""

Way is dependent on her Social Security and paycheck to get by, as she did not expect to live to her 80s. She spent her retirement savings early, putting two grandchildren through college. Her son and grandson live with her.

""I intend to be working when I reach 100,"" Way said. ""We'll see if that happens.""

Ardel Richter, 84, had a storied career in real estate sales and as a notary signing agent. But in 2022, she spiraled after a ""perfect storm"" of events — heightened competition in the real estate market that tanked her income, her husband's death in a car crash, and the sale of her rental properties at a meager profit.

Now, Richter, who lives in north-central Arkansas, accepts whatever notary jobs she can find, often at a lower fee than she'd like. She estimates she makes about $685 a month. Between her $842 monthly Social Security, one remaining rental property that brings in $1,250 a month, and her notary job, she brings in just $185 over her usual expenses each month.

""Being tethered to a cellphone and/or computer isn't freeing, but it works, as there is no way I could cope with a job with set hours,"" Richter said.

Although she considers her health good, the stress of work and some minor health issues make her feel more tired. She takes calcium supplements, struggles to lift heavier objects, and finds that daily tasks take longer than they did two years ago.

""It's a tightrope walk with no net,"" Richter said. ""Nor do I know how long the rope is.""

Jack Rowe, a former Aetna CEO and professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University, said the ""forgotten middle,"" meaning those who earn above the poverty line but not enough to live comfortably, are particularly vulnerable to a dearth of geriatricians, changes to Medicaid policy, and care worker staffing challenges. This demographic often cannot afford to quit working, which could contribute to ailments like fatigue.

Despite working for six decades in various roles, Kathy Curtis, 81, has found herself with limited savings and facing health issues.

For the past decade, Curtis has worked part-time in the office of a local water company, earning $18 an hour. Because she lives in a rural area in Northern California, where seeing people out and about is less likely, the job is ""like a social event,"" she said. Still, she regrets how tired it makes her feel. She gets out of breath easily, though she's grateful her health issues of the past, such as breast cancer and blood clots in her lungs, have gone away.

Between $1,186 in Social Security and the couple hundred dollars she makes from work each month, she squeezes by, she says. Her homeowners' insurance rose after the region's wildfires. Her grandson lives with her and helps her out.

""I've never made a lot of money, but I've also never looked, acted, or felt like a poverty case either, even though a great deal of the time I've stayed just barely above poverty,"" Curtis said.

Some of those who don't technically need to work told Business Insider that it provides something necessary: a purpose.

Clark Allan Blasdell, 81, works full-time for a nonprofit community development corporation he founded half a century ago and has no regrets about how he managed his finances. Actually getting to work, though, is much more of a feat than ever.

Two years ago, Blasdell started going blind. He lost his driver's license, so he has to take the train or rely on others to get around. It's been harder to stay on top of his type 1 diabetes since he regularly has to check his blood sugar levels. Still, he hopes to work until the day he dies since the extra money won't hurt.

""I'm just hopeful that I'll be able to keep my ears open, my eyes open, and that they're working, and I'm trying to find somebody who can help me with this,"" Blasdell said.

Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at the financial services company DA Davidson, said that financial advisors have worked increasingly more with clients on addressing long-term care and health planning instead of waiting until health deteriorates.

""We're actively trying to engage in those conversations when people are in their 50s and early 60s, when they're healthy, they're insurable, and they can be at a preferred rate,"" Crowell said. ""Don't wait till you're in your 70s and you've now got glaucoma or COPD. You're not going to get the preferred premium that you would hope to,"" he said, referring to Medicare supplement plans.

Back in northwest Arkansas, Willson peers out the window, watching her daughter steering a riding lawn mower around her property. A groundhog stares back as she contemplates her future.

Amid the hardships of running the rental business and navigating her job search, she takes a breath. Her health seems stable for the moment, and she suspects there is light at the end of their driveway.

""Everyone thinks their situation is pretty bad, but I know there are people a lot worse than I am,"" Willson said. ""It'll be OK.""

Of course, she yearns for the days of better health and financial security. She would like to have a full night's sleep and wake up refreshed. She would like to have a more stable part-time job that gives her purpose. There's only so much optimism someone like Willson can muster when missing a tax bill or credit card payment can have a domino effect.

But like many workers in their 80s and 90s, Willson has no desire to give up on decades of effort, even if it means being stubborn. She feels she'll eventually find a way to make ends meet.

Willson walks cautiously down the steps to her small storage room, filled with boxes of old papers. She pulls out her mother's Bible. In it are hundreds of annotations and notes mentioning Willson and her siblings. She flips through the pages, pauses to read her mother's heavy cursive handwriting, then puts it back in the box. Memories from eight decades flow through her mind as she steps carefully back to her desk using a walker.

It's moments like this, she says, that give her the will to do everything in her power to stay around a little longer.

I'll admit I'm fairly skeptical of the results of xAI's new Grokipedia and its mission to be an anti-woke version of Wikipedia.

And yet, after testing it out a little bit, I was surprised to find that, in certain cases, it seems better than Wikipedia.

Of course, its entries for hot-button things like ""Elon Musk"" or ""gender"" are exactly what you'd expect for its ""unbiased"" mission. It hurts my head to think about this too much, so I won't linger on this.

But most pages are not hotbeds of ""wokism,"" so they end up almost word-for-word identical to Wikipedia. (Grokipedia is able to essentially copy from Wikipedia because Wikipedia allows itself to be scraped by AI bots). So far, Grokipedia has about 800,000 pages, whereas Wikipedia's English-language version has over 7 million. 

xAI did not respond to a request for comment on how Grokipedia pages were chosen.

For example, one of the first things I compared was the entries for the 2008 animated movie ""Bolt"", where a superhero dog is voiced by John Travolta. (I had happened to look at the Wikipedia page for it while my kid was watching the movie recently.) As you can probably imagine, this isn't a particularly political entry.

Like most movie entries, Grokipedia's has a plot summary, some production details, a cast list, and an overview of the critical reception. (I asked ChatGPT to compare the two articles to see which had more ""bias,"" and in a case of AI-on-AI crime, ChatGPT accused Grok of having a pro-corporate bias by taking only Disney execs' word on some of the elements of production. Ha!)

After browsing around Grokipedia for a while, I came across some things that seemed particularly promising.

The types of pages where Grokipedia seemed to beat Wikipedia were the unloved, scraggly entries on Wikipedia. You know the kind — where it truly seems like a bunch of people added in a single sentence once a year for the last 15 years. Where the writing lacks cohesion, tiny details are given equal prominence alongside big facts, and the result is generally a mess.

Here's an example of one of these. I had recently looked up the Wikipedia entry for the Dana Hall School, a fancy girls' private school near Boston where the recent Nobel Peace Prize winner attended. The entry isn't short, but it's disorganized, with a lengthy ""history"" section that reads like a list of disjointed bullet points.

Meanwhile, the Grokipedia version felt much more thorough and organized into sections about its history, academics, facilities, admissions, and impact. This is one of those things where there is lots of solid information about it existing out there on the internet — more than has been added so far to the Wikipedia page by real humans — and an AI can crawl the web to find these sources and turn it into text. (Note: I did not fact-check Grokipedia's entry, and it's totally possible it got all sorts of stuff wrong!)

I will note that there are some unusual aspects to the entry, however. There's a whole section that talks about the arguments for and against single-sex education and a discussion of the school's racial diversity that has more than a whiff of an anti-DEI agenda. My head hurts again, so let's set that aside for now.

What I can see is a version where AI is able to flesh out certain types of articles and improve them with additional information from reliable sources. In my poking around, I found a few other cases like this: entries for small towns, which are often sparse on Wikipedia, are filled out more robustly on Grokipedia.

One interesting example: By clicking ""Random article"" on Wikipedia and searching for corresponding Grokipedia entries, I found a curious case where the two entries differ slightly.

For the case of Baroness Marie Vetsera, a woman involved in a minor 18th-century royal scandal, Wikipedia had a substantial entry. But Grokipedia's was even longer, and formatted quite differently — and frankly, I thought it told a better narrative of the baroness's untimely demise. But it also had some bad quirks. For example, Grokipedia used a citation for a Facebook page about royal history that seemed to be viral clickbait written by AI.

Obviously, Grokipedia is not perfect — far, far from it. But it's an interesting idea of how AI could help to improve Wikipedia itself. It could smooth out stilted writing or pad out pages that need improving.

Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikimedia, the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia, recently appeared on NPR's Open to Debate show, where he said that he's not opposed to AI helping out. He gives an example of an editor looking at a page that needs improvement and asking AI to identify additional relevant facts in the sources already on the page. Then the editor could verify those and add them himself. Seems reasonable!

I'm not planning on switching to Grokipedia for factual information anytime soon, and I don't recommend you do, either.

In a way, the best outcome would be for Wikipedia to observe what does or doesn't work on Grokipedia as a sort of sandbox, and take lessons from it.

Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled Friday afternoon that President Donald Trump must fund food stamps during the government shutdown.

In a Friday night Truth Social post, Trump signaled he would comply with the judges' orders.

""Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do,"" the president said on Truth Social.

He added, ""Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.""

The cases, filed on behalf of states, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations this week, called for the Trump administration to use contingency funds to pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.

The rulings reverse the USDA's plans to pause benefits starting November 1 after their typical funding sources ran out. Patrick A. Penn, deputy undersecretary for US Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, said in a letter to state leaders on October 24 that the Agriculture Department is ""suspending all November 2025 benefit allotments until such time as sufficient federal funding is provided, or until FNS directs State agencies otherwise.""

In documents seen by Business Insider, the US Department of Agriculture said it has money held in contingency funds to be used in case of emergency, but said those funds cannot be used for SNAP. Because of previous budget allocations, using federal funds to pay for November benefits would pull money away from other important programs, like school lunches or disaster relief, the Department said.

The judges' rulings mean that the Trump administration must continue funding SNAP while the case plays out in court.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is America's largest food safety net, helping around 42 million low-income households afford groceries each month.

The rulings on Friday mean that the Agriculture Department must distribute November SNAP benefits to Americans. Both the Massachusetts and Rhode Island judges are requiring the Trump Administration to provide an update on funding by Monday.

""The court's ruling protects millions of families, seniors, and veterans from being used as leverage in a political fight and upholds the principle that no one in America should go hungry,"" Skye Perryman, President and CEO of the left-leaning policy and legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, said in a statement. The organization is a plaintiff in the Rhode Island case.

SNAP is funded by the federal government and managed by individual states. It's not yet been determined if these benefits will be partial or full checks.

Any previous unused benefits will also be allowed to roll over this month, Penn said in his October 24 letter. ""Households shall receive retroactive benefits once the suspension is lifted upon the availability of federal funding,"" he said, adding that the shutdown does not impact SNAP eligibility rules — new applicants can still be processed into the system and will receive checks when a budget is available.

Zac Hall, senior vice president of programs at Food Bank for New York City, told Business Insider the stakes for low-income Americans are high.

""SNAP is the first best lifeline for folks to access food resources who are having trouble putting together meals on their own,"" Hall said. ""It's a lifeline for 42-plus million Americans, folks in cities, folks in increasingly expensive suburbs, folks in rural areas.""

SNAP makes a big difference in many families' ability to afford basic groceries. Benefits can be used to buy fruits, vegetables, meat, and grains. Losing SNAP, even for a couple of weeks, can be devastating.

Each year, SNAP costs about $100 billion to operate — which translates to monthly checks of roughly $25 to $1,700, depending on a household's income and number of members. Beneficiaries typically work and live near the federal poverty line, which is about $15,000 annually for a single person. About 12% of Americans receive SNAP, though enrollment varies by state.

Other nutrition aid programs, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), could see a disruption of November benefits until the government reopens, although benefits for those programs have continued through October. Social Security checks, Medicare, and Medicaid will continue as normal.

""We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,"" a USDA spokesperson told Business Insider before the rulings. ""Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments."" USDA did not immediately respond to comment on the rulings.

With Republicans and Democrats at an impasse over healthcare funding, it's unclear when the government will reopen. This shutdown, now 31 days long as of Saturday, is approaching a record, with the longest previous shutdown lasting 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019.

During the 2018-2019 shutdown, SNAP avoided a lapse in benefits by paying funds early, causing a longer-than-usual gap between checks. States did not have federal funding to pay benefits early this time around.

A Republican-led bill to fund SNAP during the shutdown and guarantee back pay for beneficiaries dating back to September 30 has not passed the Senate, and the House has remained out of session since mid-September.

Hall said food banks have been bracing for a spike in need. Local rules vary, but food banks generally don't have income requirements, so anyone experiencing long-term or temporary food insecurity can use them as a stopgap.

The judges' ruling means that SNAP will have access to some contingency funding, though it's unclear how long that will last. The Trump administration will also have an opportunity to appeal.

Beneficiaries can still expect changes to the program when the government reopens. Trump's spending plan, which he signed into law in July, will reduce funding for federal nutrition aid like SNAP by nearly $200 billion over the next decade.

The plan will also require nondisabled adults without dependents to fulfill work requirements until they reach age 64 to qualify for aid, up from the current cutoff age of 54. That work requirement change is scheduled to begin on November 1. An estimate from the Congressional Budget Office found that over 2 million Americans could lose SNAP coverage with these adjustments.

In the meantime, Hall said he's focused on the millions of Americans who need access to reliable meals. Food Bank for NYC said it is ""grateful to the courts for recognizing the urgent need to ensure funding.""

""One month of SNAP really dwarfs our work, and no single charitable organization can fill that gap,"" Hall said. ""And, indeed, no single ecosystem of food assistance is able to fill the gap made by SNAP.""

Air traffic controller shortages are piling up as the government shutdown drags on, with delays and disruptions being reported at airports nationwide.

The Federal Aviation Administration had issued staffing triggers —which signify an air traffic control center is understaffed — for an unusually long list of centers as of Friday evening.

At least 11 airports that experienced delays on Friday evening cited staffing as an issue, according to FAA advisories.

Airports experiencing delays included all three major New York airports — Newark, John F. Kennedy, and LaGuardia — which were also dealing with weather concerns.

About half of all departures from LaGuardia were delayed, according to Flightaware data, and together the three airports have tallied more than 800 delays and cancellations.

""JFK, Newark, and LaGuardia are all under FAA traffic restrictions this evening because of high winds and reduced staffing in multiple air traffic control centers,"" the New York City Emergency Management Department said, adding, ""More restrictions are possible if conditions worsen. Travelers should expect widespread ripple delays and check with their airline for the latest flight status.""

Other airports that experienced staffing-related delays on Friday included Nashville International, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and George Bush Intercontinental in Houston.

Since the government shutdown on October 1, airports around the country have reported delays and disruptions related to a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown.

They got their first $0 paycheck on October 28.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association previously said the issue highlighted the importance of addressing the existing air traffic controller shortage.

The FAA and Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

If you're one of the millions of unemployed Americans looking for work right now, it's clear the job market is tough.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in August, the number of job seekers outpaced available openings in the US for the first time since April 2021. The shift comes amid a wave of layoffs this year across major employers, including Amazon, Meta, and GM.

For many out-of-work Americans, it's easy to feel discouraged — but there's still hope. WalletHub has ranked the best and worst cities in the US for job hunters, showing where your odds might be strongest and weakest.

To find out where you'll have the best chance at landing, keeping, and actually enjoying a job, WalletHub compared all 50 states using 34 metrics that reflect job-market strength and economic health. These include factors such as employment growth, median annual income, average commute time, job security, and even the likelihood that artificial intelligence could take your job in the future.

WalletHub found that many of the best states for jobs are clustered in New England, the Upper Midwest, and the Great Plains, with Texas being the lone Southern state. Despite their regional and industry differences, from tech in Massachusetts to agriculture in the Dakotas, these states share common strengths: low unemployment, solid job growth, and business-friendly environments.

""The best states for jobs make it easier for residents to find and retain jobs, and employers in these states also offer very competitive compensation and benefits,"" said WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo.

These are the 10 best and 10 worst states for job prospects, according to WalletHub. Business Insider added September median home sale prices from Redfin and 2024 median household income data from the Missouri Census Data Center's ACS Profiles.

The USS New Jersey is a battleship of superlatives.

Fastest battleship ever built? Check. The ship's fastest speed was a record-setting 35.2 knots, or a little over 40 miles per hour, in 1968.

Longest battleship ever built? Check. At 887 feet and 7 inches long, the USS New Jersey is almost three football fields long, and 5 feet longer than the Titanic.

Most-decorated battleship in US history? Check, again. The USS New Jersey earned 19 battle stars throughout its career.

Originally built for combat in World War II, the USS New Jersey was so powerful and irreplaceable that the Navy kept recommissioning it until the 1990s. After it was decommissioned for the last time, it was transformed into a museum based in its namesake state where visitors can explore spaces such as the combat engagement center, officers' staterooms, and gun turrets.

Just don't expect to be able to see the entire ship.

""I've been here eight years now,"" Ryan Szimanski, curator of Battleship New Jersey, told Business Insider. ""I still have not been in all 1,600 rooms.""

Take a look inside the USS New Jersey.

The 45,000-ton ship cost around $150 million to build in the 1940s, or around $2 billion in 2025 when adjusted for inflation.

Reagan was the first sitting president to commission a battleship.

After serving in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, it was decommissioned for the final time in 1991. The ship opened to the public as a museum in 2001.

The museum, operated by Battleship New Jersey, offers daily self-guided and guided tours. Self-guided tours for adults cost $30, while guided tours cost $40. Tickets can be purchased through Battleship New Jersey.

The USS New Jersey's shore bombardment capabilities made it irreplaceable from World War II through the 1980s.

""Even though aircraft carriers rendered battleships obsolete nominally in World War II, in the '50s, they bring the ship back. In the '60s, they bring the ship back. In the '80s, they bring the ship back. Because to this day, we haven't developed a platform that can cheaply provide that shore bombardment,"" Szimanski said.

The Mark 7 16-inch guns were last fired in combat on February 26, 1984, during the Lebanese Civil War.

They're called 16-inch guns because they could fire 16-inch shells — the actual barrels themselves are 66.7 feet long. The explosive rounds weighed 1,900 pounds and armor-piercing rounds weighed 2,700 pounds — about the same as a Kia Soul.

The 16-inch guns could hit targets up to 23 miles away.

""Pull the trigger on that,"" Szimanski said, pointing to a M2 Browning machine gun on the deck.

Far be it from me to disobey a direct order. I squeezed the trigger, unleashing the sound effect of firing 485 to 635 rounds per minute.

This particular gun was a replica, but visitors to the USS New Jersey can fire blanks from its 5-inch or 40mm saluting guns upon making a donation to the museum.

During the Korean War in 1951, Oesterwind was fatally wounded by shrapnel from a North Korean shell while attacking a North Korean transportation hub. Though the shell didn't break through the ship's armor, three other sailors were wounded, and parts of the ship sustained superficial damage.

The green line serves as the introductory tour, bringing visitors through crew members' bunks, the officers' wardroom, the captain's cabin, and museum exhibit spaces.

The red line focuses on weapons and navigation, with stops like the combat engagement center and missile deck.

The yellow line features an inside look at the crew's life on board, highlighting the library, barber shop, and laundry facilities.

Finally, the blue line tour, titled ""Into the Citadel,"" includes the engine rooms, a 16-inch turret barbette, and the World War II-era radio room.

Szimanski guided me through a combination of these routes for a broader look at the ship, but if you do all four as they're laid out, it's 1 ½ miles long and covers 200 of the ship's 1,600 rooms.

The USS New Jersey was designed to hold 2,000 crew members, but during War War II, there were 2,700 sailors on board. When there weren't enough bunks, sailors slept in hammocks.

By the end of the ship's career, the crew was down to around 1,600.

The crew members who slept in communal spaces like this were often lower-ranking sailors who were newer to the Navy, such as the gunner's mates who operated the ship's 16-inch guns.

Around 3,000 former crew members have visited the museum since it opened in 2001, Szimanski said.

Officers were seated by rank and only began eating once the executive officer, or XO, gave the signal.

Unlike enlisted crew members, officers paid for all of their meals.

Reason was the first Black four-star admiral in the US Navy. From 1989 to 1990, he commanded Battle Group Romeo, of which the USS New Jersey was the flagship, in the Persian Gulf.

Reason told the museum that he read classified information at a desk in his bedroom, but otherwise spent most of his time working at a larger desk in the stateroom.

The desk in the USS New Jersey's stateroom was taken from another 1980s-era ship at the Navy Yard.

The spacious room was meant to impress foreign leaders … and intimidate them.

""It's very specifically placed right here so that when dignitaries come across the gangway, they have to walk past the gun turrets to get here,"" Szimanski said.

Another third of the silver service is on display at the New Jersey governor's mansion in Princeton, while the remaining third's whereabouts are unknown.

The Combat Engagement Center, or CEC, was added to the USS New Jersey when the ship was recommissioned in the 1980s. It featured more modern equipment such as the Tomahawk Weapons System for launching Tomahawk missiles, and sensors including Air Search and Surface Search radars.

Volunteers worked to make the CEC as realistic as possible with screens showing mock-ups of how the computers functioned. Much of this equipment is still used on modern Navy ships.

""We haven't figured out with 100% certainty that we carried nuclear weapons, but we were certainly nuclear-capable,"" Szimanski said.

About two years ago, a new staff member was cleaning out a predecessor's office and found a box of keys. Upon closer examination, the museum realized the keys had brass tags that read ""nuclear PTF,"" which stands for ""permission to fire.""

When museum staffers tested the keys in the ""nuclear perm to fire"" lock in the combat engagement center, they fit inside.

""The Navy just left the original keys on board, the museum had them, and we didn't know we had them for over 20 years,"" Szimanski said.

A ladder leads from the admiral's state room up to the admiral's bridge for easy access. The four chairs in this space were reserved exclusively for the use of admirals.

A New Jersey native, Halsey chose the USS New Jersey to be his flagship. He commanded the Navy's 3rd Fleet in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, the largest naval battle of World War II and believed by many to be the largest naval battle in history.

Only four officers have ever been promoted to five-star fleet admiral in the history of the Navy. Since Halsey held the title, no other officer has been promoted to that level.

The conning tower's armor was over 17 inches thick, the thickest single piece of armor plate on the entire ship.

The helm, which steered the ship, was located inside the conning tower. The captain could also communicate with crew members in the engine room about the ship's speed.

If the conning tower was damaged or destroyed during battle, there were three other places on board where the ship could be steered from. Contingencies upon contingencies were crucial.

""That's the real genius of this ship, the level of redundancy that they built in,"" Szimanski said. ""Okay, you might be able to shoot through this and knock that out, but we've got four backups or six backups. We've found one system so far that has at least 46 different backups.""

The USS New Jersey measures 11 stories high.

Visible across the Delaware River, the Independence Seaport Museum houses two more historic vessels: the USS Olympia, the oldest steep warship still afloat in the world, and the USS Becuna, a World War II Balao-class submarine.

The museum offers special 90-minute in-depth tours of Turret II, spanning five stories.

The Mark 8 Rangekeeper could calculate where a target would be when the projectile arrived while accounting for factors such as the Earth's rotation, known as the Coriolis effect.

The USS New Jersey has the last Mark 8 Rangekeeper in the world that still works.

""My favorite thing about the computer is in the 1980s, they looked at replacing it with a modern digital computer and they chose not to,"" Szimanski said. ""The modern computer was as accurate, but it wasn't more accurate, so why waste the money? Plus, if we lose power because we've been hit by the enemy, the modern computer dies. This one has a hand crank as a backup. You just pick the lowest-ranking sailor in the room.""

A screen also showed video footage of the guns firing, making it feel even more realistic.

The hallway featured equipment such as oxygen breathing apparatuses and doors leading to fire rooms and engine rooms.

In the fire room, crew members controlled how much fuel was being pumped into the burners by changing the fuel nozzles. This was done every four hours or every time the ship changed speed.

The Navy added air conditioning to the rest of the ship in the 1980s, but there was no point in trying to cool off the boiler room, which could reach temperatures of 120 degrees.

If a torpedo from an enemy ship penetrated the ship's multiple layers of steel — three layers on the bottom and five on the sides — crew members in the fire room could make a quick escape via this four-story ladder.

With a top speed of 35.2 knots, or a little over 40 miles per hour, the USS New Jersey still holds the record for the fastest battleship anywhere in the world because the Navy never built another class of battleship after the Iowa class.

""We are not allowed to run our radar, because if we did, all of the cable TV within 50 miles would go out,"" Szimanski said.

Enlisted crew members were served in buffet-style lines on metal trays, unlike officers who ate on china and silver.

Enlisted crew members could choose between the meal of the day, which would have been entrees like ginger pot roast or steak and lobster, or fast-food-style items such as pizza, hot dogs, and cheeseburgers, which were always available.

They had around 12 minutes to eat their meals. Since the crew was so large, they ate in at least three shifts.

The USS New Jersey usually had two chaplains on board — one Protestant and one Catholic — but the chapel was a non-denominational space that held worship services for other faiths, as well.

The library held around 6,000 books.

Male crew members' hair was not allowed to be any longer than 3 inches.

The ship's washing machines could wash 100 pounds of uniforms per load, and the dryers held 50 pounds each.

The steam presses used auxiliary steam from the ship's boilers to iron uniforms.

In the brig, prisoners received one ration of bread and water per day and had to be escorted to the bathroom by a Marine.

The USS New Jersey carried different aircraft throughout its years of service.

During World War II, it deployed Kingfisher and Seahawk seaplanes to monitor the aim of the 16-inch guns. Helicopters replaced seaplanes in the Korean War, when a Sikorsky HO3S-1 Dragonfly helicopter known as the ""Jersey Bounce"" assisted with search-and-rescue missions. In the 1980s, the Seasprite helicopter was used to detect submarines and deliver supplies.

Why did the Navy phase out battleships? Szimanski said the answer was simple: Battleships have large-caliber guns and thick armor, but neither can withstand missiles.

However, President Donald Trump has expressed interest in bringing battleships back. At the September all-hands meeting called by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth featuring 800 military leaders, Trump said that he'd spoken to Navy Secretary John Phelan and that it's ""something we're seriously considering.""

""Some people would say, 'No, that's old technology.' I don't know. I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns,"" Trump said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Navy referred Business Insider to the Office of the Secretary of War, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Destroyers are equipped with high-range guns and missiles. Long-range strikes are carried out by aircraft carriers. And submarines have filled the role of anti-surface warships. However, there's no vessel that can execute shore bombardment as effectively and efficiently as battleships did with their large artillery.

That's why the USS New Jersey was brought out of retirement again and again after World War II — and why it would still serve as a crucial asset if the need arose.

When personal trainer Dani Coleman got an email in 2021 about working with Jennifer Aniston, she assumed it had to be a prank. She had never worked with a celebrity before.

""It was definitely a 'pinch me' moment,"" Coleman, the director of training at fitness company Pvolve, told Business Insider.

It was, in fact, the Jennifer Aniston: star of ""Friends,"" Primetime Emmy winner, Hollywood actress-turned-producer.

Coleman told me that Aniston heard about Pvolve through a friend and had been quietly tuning in to livestreamed workouts during the first year of the pandemic. As in-person fitness made a comeback, Aniston reached out to Pvolve's Los Angeles studio for 1:1 sessions.

Even four and a half years later, Coleman said it still feels surreal to be working with a celebrity three to four times a week. She said Aniston, 56, is an impressive athlete who consistently works hard in the gym, whether she has an hour or 20 minutes to spare in her busy schedule.

""She's a dream client. It's just magical working together,"" Coleman said.

She said Aniston's routine takes a three-part approach — weight-lifting with cardio and stability — and is a great template for anyone who supports a longer, healthier life with a few hours in the gym each week.

""I think you can make amazing progress with two full-body workouts a week,"" Coleman said. ""For the average person, the hardest part is just consistency.""

Resistance exercise to build strength and muscle is a cornerstone of Aniston's workouts, Coleman said.

Her gym sessions focus on a technique called progressive strength training, which involves gradually increasing the challenge of a workout by adding more weight, sets, or reps — continually pushing the muscles to grow.

Coleman said the workouts incorporate dumbbell weights, which help activate more muscle groups than exercise machines, requiring core strength to help control the weight. If Aniston is traveling, those exercises can be adapted, swapping free weights for a resistance band.

Regardless of which equipment you choose, research suggests weight training is a good idea to improve longevity — preventing frailty, improving metabolic health, and staving off cancer and heart diseases by making the body more resilient.

Progressive overload is key if you want to keep making progress. For best results, track your reps, sets, and weights to ensure you continue to build on your efforts over time without overdoing it.

Heart-pumping aerobic exercise is another essential part of Aniston's workouts, typically in short bursts of high-intensity movement.

Coleman said she uses plyometric exercises, explosive movements that train the body to use fast-switch muscle fibers, in addition to amping up heart rate.

For more joint-friendly options to work around previous injuries (Aniston has had knee surgeries and back problems), Coleman said she includes scaled options, such as a step-up or weighted step-up, instead of a box jump.

Aerobic exercise helps protect your heart as you age, even if you're only doing short doses of movement at a time, research suggests.

One of Aniston's strongest attributes in the gym is impressive core strength, Coleman said.

""I haven't seen a plank this woman can't do. It's insane,"" Coleman said — whether it's side planks, sliders, or renegade rows.

But, Coleman said, ""There's a lot that goes into the core outside of just the aesthetics of the core.""

Ultimately, core strength is about stabilizing your body so everything works right — from metabolism to staying nimble as you age. For that, you really need to tap into the stabilizing muscles of the hips and glutes.

Besides plank variations, good exercises for core and stability include good mornings, medicine ball rotations, and single-leg balance drills.

""Training is important at every stage of your life, and it's awesome to be owning that through different chapters of life,"" Coleman said. ""It's all about independence, the quality of life that you're able to keep for longer.""

Aniston previously said she gave up on the ""no pain, no gain"" approach to working out and stopped pushing herself through long, grueling cardio sessions.

The benefit of working smarter, not harder, is that you're less likely to burn out or get injured, according to Coleman.

""It's knowing that, OK, I can get a really great workout, but leave feeling energized and I can consistently do this because my body isn't breaking down along the way, but still be challenged,"" she said.

The ink was barely dry on BlackRock Inc.'s $12 billion acquisition of HPS Investment Partners when executives at the private credit giant realized one of their investments had gone horribly wrong.

HPS had teamed up with BNP Paribas SA to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to a group of companies run by little-known businessman Bankim Brahmbhatt, according to people with knowledge of the matter. HPS had taken the riskiest portion of the financing — which was purportedly backed by receivables from some of the world's biggest telecommunications providers — eyeing double-digit returns, said the people, who asked not to be identified citing private information.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Javier Milei strode onto the stage in Santiago, flung up his arms and gave a bow to an economist with a front-row seat: Rolf Lüders, one of the last of the original Chicago Boys. 

That was in 2019, four years before Milei would win election to Argentina's presidency and start delivering his anarcho-capitalist style of shock therapy to one of Latin America's most crisis-wracked countries. When the two men had huddled earlier that day, Lüders recalled, Milei eagerly soaked up the first-hand account of how a band of University of Chicago economists transformed Chile into a free-market blockbuster a half-century ago.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

President Donald Trump has said he feels an “obligation” to watch in person as the US Supreme Court weighs his powers to impose tariffs on much of the world. If Trump does, he will make history as the first sitting president ever to attend oral arguments at the nation's highest court.

There is no record in the Supreme Court's 235-year history of a sitting president ever attending arguments, according to Clare Cushman, director of publications and resident historian at the Supreme Court Historical Society.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Celebrities — they're just like us.

Credit: The Late Show with Stephen Colbert/ YouTube

Emma Thompson is very good at many things — acting, screenwriting, penning children's books — and in recent years, she's also become quite accomplished at going viral. She did it again this week, during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, with a furious (and furiously funny) profanity-laden dismissal of the increasingly inescapable scourge of generative artificial intelligence.

She wasn't specifically talking about the high-end use of AI in filmmaking. Her irritation stemmed from the first step of the process: transferring her writing, done in longhand, into a Word document. With a flurry of f-bombs and mounting exasperation, she described how tired she is of the software asking if she'd like it to rewrite her work — a moment that perfectly captures the creeping intrusion of AI into tasks that once felt simple and organic.

The latest chapter, or perhaps page, in the annals of the US-China trade war concluded this week with a one-year truce reached by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Whether the newfound accord will last, against the backdrop of intense great-power competition, is tough to predict.

But whenever the next flare-up does occur, Beijing will still have a weapon it has yet to deploy in all of the rounds of escalation and de-escalation to date. Besides controls over the vital rare-earth supply chain and the suspension of US agriculture purchases, China has in its quiver the ability to deprive Americans of vital pharmaceuticals.

In this article

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp rebound in operating profit on Saturday, while its cash pile swelled to a new high with no buybacks.

Berkshire's operating profit generated from the conglomerate's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads jumped 34% year over year to $13.485 billion in the third quarter. The gains were driven by a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which rose to $2.37 billion.

Buffett once again refrained from repurchasing shares despite a significant pullback in the stock. The company said there were no share buybacks during the first nine months of 2025. Class A and B shares of the conglomerate are up 5% each in 2025, while the S&P 500 is up 16.3%.

Without any buybacks, Berkshire's cash hoard swelled to a record $381.6 billion, surpassing the previous high of $347.7 billion set in the first quarter of this year.

Berkshire also didn't find other stocks attractive, net selling equities in the third quarter for a taxable gain of $10.4 billion.

The 95-year-old Buffett in May announced he's stepping down as CEO at the year-end after six legendary decades. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as chief executive, while Buffett will remain chairman of the board. Abel will also start writing annual letters in 2026.

The Omaha-based conglomerate's shares have tumbled double digits from all-time highs following the announcement. The sell-off partially reflects the so-called Buffett premium, or the extra price investors are willing to pay because of the billionaire's unmatched record and exceptional capital allocation skills.

Last month, Berkshire announced a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal marks Berkshire's largest since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.

Overall earnings, which include gains from Berkshire's investments in other publicly traded companies, rose 17% to $30.8 billion year on year.

Chinese President Xi Jinping took center stage at a meeting of APEC leaders on Saturday to push a proposal for a global body to govern artificial intelligence and position China as an alternative to the United States on trade cooperation.

The comments were the first by the Chinese leader on an initiative Beijing unveiled this year, while the United States has rejected efforts to regulate AI in international bodies.

Xi said a World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization could set governance rules and boost cooperation, making AI a ""public good for the international community"".

In remarks published by the official news agency Xinhua, Xi added, ""Artificial intelligence is of great significance for future development and should be made for the benefit of people in all countries and regions.""

Chinese officials have said the organization could be based in the commercial hub of Shanghai.

U.S. President Donald Trump did not attend the APEC leaders' summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, flying back to Washington directly after a meeting with Xi.

The two leaders' talks yielded a one-year deal to partially roll back trade and technology controls that had spiked tension between the world's two biggest economies.

In Trump's absence, analysts had expected Xi to use the APEC meeting to promote China as champion for its own brand of multilateral cooperation on trade and economic development.

While advanced chips made by California-based Nvidia are central to the AI boom, China-based developer DeepSeek has rolled out lower-cost models taken up by Beijing in a push for what it calls ""algorithmic sovereignty.""

Xi also urged APEC to promote the ""free circulation"" of green technologies, a cluster of industries from batteries to solar panels that China dominates.

APEC members approved a joint declaration and pacts on AI and the challenge of ageing populations at the meeting.

China will host the 2026 APEC summit in Shenzhen, a major hub for manufacturing, from robotics to electric car production.

Xi said the city of nearly 18 million had been a fishing village until it boomed as one of China's first special economic zones in the 1980s.

APEC is a consultative forum of 21 nations representing half of global trade.

It's often said that ""there's no such thing as balance"" in entrepreneurship, but startup founder Desmond Lim disagrees.

The CEO and co-founder of Workstream, a HR, payroll and hiring platform for hourly workers, says that balance isn't just possible — it's also necessary.

Running a company can be very taxing, said Lim, who works about 11 hours a day on average.

Not only are the hours long, but it can also be mentally consuming. ""The emotional ups and downs are always very challenging ... The highs are very high, the lows are very low,"" said Lim.

""Every year, you still think the company could die. And then I just try to remind myself ... you are still alive, healthy, everything is good,"" he said. ""And the other thing is, you cannot stop thinking about work. I dream about it.""

That's why Lim believes it's crucial for entrepreneurs to protect their health and energy. His strategy? Sticking to a fixed daily schedule that works best for his body and brain. ""My advice is, find your own rhythm,"" the 39-year-old said.

Lim follows what he calls a ""dual schedule,"" inspired by an essay by Paul Graham, the co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator.

Graham's essay breaks down two types of time management: a manager's schedule — typically packed with back-to-back, hour-long meetings — and a maker's schedule, designed for creators like programmers or writers who thrive working in long, uninterrupted stretches to focus and build.

""I actually like to have my schedule mixed ... I like to have calls, deep work, calls, deep work,"" said Lim. Rather than sticking strictly to one style, Lim said he thrives by mixing both and following his own rhythm.

Here's what Lim's weekday typically looks like:

On weekends, Lim says he locks away his work phone in a cupboard and focuses on spending time with family.

Along with saving weekends for family time, Lim also prioritizes his passion for sports and exercise by building it into his daily schedule.

""One advice [I have] for founders and leaders is ... to go very deep on one passion you have that is not work [related],"" said Lim. ""For me, that has been sports ... I do a lot of basketball, swimming, and gym. I think having a balance other than work has been very helpful for me.""

Lim developed his love for basketball when he was seven. He went on to captain his school teams from middle school to university, and even played professionally for the Singapore National Youth Team.

These days, he still starts each morning with 75 to 90 minutes of exercise —calisthenics, gym training or basketball — often with a friend to keep him accountable.

""I really believe in being able to move well ... [especially] as you grow old,"" he said. ""I try to get the non-negotiables out [of the way] in the early morning. For me, it's sports.""

Artificial intelligence is set to have a huge impact on the gaming industry and its billions of players, according to Min-Liang Tan, the billionaire CEO and co-founder of gaming firm Razer.

From the ways in which games are developed to hacks for completing levels, Tan said the technology's ramifications across the sector can't be overstated.

""For us at Razer, the way we see it is that AI is going to completely disrupt everything, or change everything in gaming,"" Tan told CNBC's ""Beyond the Valley"" podcast.

Gaming plays a significant role in the creative sector, with 3.6 billion players around the world and annual revenue of nearly $189 billion, according to research company Newzoo, which tracks data across mobile, console and PC games.

""Game developers will now be able to use AI tools, and then you've got game publishers that will now distribute, market new games with AI tools … For gamers, the AI tools will be able to change things, in terms of the way they play,"" Tan told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at Singapore's SWITCH conference.

Razer, known for its gaming gear like mice, headsets and keyboards, has developed Game Co-AI, a tool that uses computer vision to ""watch"" how a gamer plays and provides tips on solving quests or defeating enemies. The tool will also use data such as public APIs, and a beta version of Game Co-AI will be available ""later in 2025,"" according to Razer's website.

The potential use of AI in esports — or competitive gaming — has sparked debate, however. 

""We will not have AI running, I think, during a game itself, but what about at the point of time of training?"" Tan said. There is an appetite among some esports players to use AI to help coach future stars, Tan said. ""There's a lot of excitement in respect of this. The opportunities are limitless.""

Along with helping players, AI will also be able to detect and fix bugs when games are developed, according to Tan. 

Traditionally, game testing involved ""a whole bunch of people sitting in a room,"" playing games and identifying bugs one by one, Tan said, in a process known as quality assurance or QA. Razer is developing an AI QA Companion, which can find and log bugs — and will soon also be able to suggest bug fixes, he added.

""[QA] is about 20% to 30% of the [development] costs, it takes up about 30% of the time,"" Tan said, adding that the new tool will automate the QA process, making human testers more effective and productive.

The effects of AI are being felt across industries, but there is still some disagreement on how far AI can go in gaming. 

Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, which makes Grand Theft Auto, said on Tuesday that AI can't rival human game developers.

When asked for his gaming predictions for a year's time, however, Tan said: ""I think we will be talking about some of the new, exciting games that have been built with AI, and how we see the future from that. Maybe we might see one or two major hit games.""

Developing a game usually involves large teams and significant investment, but AI will allow smaller groups of people to do so, according to Tan. Rather than being a threat to jobs, AI can remove ""tedious"" tasks, he added. ""The human creativity still needs to be there.""

The way in which the gaming industry uses AI may have a wider impact beyond the sector, Tan said, suggesting that it could ""spawn multiple other new industries."" 

""A lot of what's happening in the tech industry was born from gaming, and I believe that a lot of what will happen for AI will also be born from AI gaming,"" he said.

Razer was founded by Tan and Robert Krakoff in 2005, and the company became known for the Boomslang, a mouse — named after a deadly snake — designed specifically for gaming. ""For a gamer, the mouse is everything. It's an extension of your arm,"" Tan said. ""The more precise your mouse is, the more likely you are going to be able to get frags,"" he said, referring to the ""kills"" made in first-person shooter games.

Headquartered in Singapore and Irvine, California, Tan said the company went global ""very quickly"" after it launched. Razer went public in 2017, listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, before going private again in 2022.

In this article

After a wave of big companies announcing steep job cuts, many laid-off workers may face a financially difficult and uncertain period ahead.

Amazon said on Tuesday that it would eliminate around 14,000 corporate positions, and the United Parcel Service, or UPS, said it had reduced its operational workforce by 34,000 jobs this year. On Wednesday, General Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers, and Paramount terminated 1,000 people. The Trump administration has also threatened to fire thousands of federal workers during the shutdown, but those efforts have been blocked so far in the courts. 

""Now is a particularly challenging time to be unemployed,"" said Michele Evermore, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't publish its monthly jobs report in October because of the government shutdown. But analysts have been worried about the state of the employment market for months.

Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead.

Some companies have said they are trimming their headcounts as they redirect resources to artificial intelligence or respond to President Donald Trump's whipsawing tariff policies and his administration's other priorities. The newest layoffs come amid a backdrop of closed federal agencies, the imminent expiration of food assistance for millions of Americans and reports of people finding it increasingly difficult to land a new job.

Following a job loss, often people need to figure out how to supplement their income, find new health insurance and continue paying their bills. CNBC spoke with experts about how unemployed workers can best navigate those steps.

Despite the government shutdown, which began on Oct.1, states still have access to their state unemployment trust fund to pay out benefits, said Andrew Stettner, the director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation.

""Eventually they will run out of federal funds to pay the staff that process the benefits, but we've not heard of that happening yet,"" Stettner said.

As a result, those who've lost their job should ""immediately file"" for unemployment insurance, Evermore said. Before you do so, you'll want to gather the following information: your pay over the last 18 months, names of previous employers during that period and their addresses, your Social Security number, state-issued identification and any documentation from your last company.

If you live in one state and work in another, you'll want to apply for the jobless benefits in the state where you worked, experts say. On a DOL-sponsored website, you can find the contact information for state unemployment agencies.

State agencies should pay benefits within three weeks of your application, but delays have become more common since the pandemic, Evermore said.

""It's probably going to get worse as layoffs increase,"" she added.

Maximum unemployment benefit amounts vary by state. For example, California's maximum weekly benefit is $450; in Florida, the cap is $275, Evermore said. In most states, claimants can get benefits for 26 weeks, she added — although the benefits last for just 12 weeks in some states, such as Florida.

For many workers, losing their jobs also means losing their health insurance.

Your first step is to find out when your workplace insurance officially expires, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corporation. Some companies provide additional months of coverage under their plan after a layoff.

Once your coverage lapses, you may be offered the chance to continue it under COBRA, shorthand for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, said Caitlin Donovan, a spokeswoman for the Patient Advocate Foundation.

The option is ""cost-prohibitive"" for many people, Donovan said, because it requires them to pay the full premium, including the portion their company was previously paying. But if you can afford the price tag, it'll cause the least disruption to your coverage. COBRA is usually available for between 18 months to 36 months, according to the Department of Labor.

Other options for getting new health insurance include enrolling in a spouse's plan or seeking subsidized coverage on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or through Medicaid, Eibner said. Those who've lost their employer health benefits typically have 60 days to sign up for an ACA Marketplace plan, Eibner added. (Open enrollment on the marketplace for 2026 starts on Nov. 1 in most states.)

At the heart of the current stalemate in Washington is whether or not to extend Covid-era enhanced tax credits for ACA marketplace enrollees. Those enhanced subsidies make health insurance premiums cheaper for tens of millions of Americans. Without that aid being extended, many people will see higher prices for marketplace coverage in 2026.

""However, the tax credits aren't going away completely,"" Eibner said. ""They are just reverting to the original levels put into place under the Affordable Care Act.""

Medicaid is the cheapest health-care option and may actually cost you close to nothing, experts said. Eligibility is based in part on your current income, which may allow many newly unemployed workers to qualify — although jobless benefits may have an impact.

If your company offered a retirement account, you'll need to decide what to do with that nest egg now.

You may be able to simply leave the money in the account, even though you won't be able to contribute to it anymore or benefit from any employer match.

""This is a great option, especially if the funds in the account are strong and if the employee needs time to focus on other things,"" said Dana Levit, a certified financial planner and the owner of Paragon Financial Advisors in the Boston area.

An exception: If you have less than $5,000 in your workplace retirement account, your employer may require that you move the funds.

You may also be able to transfer your funds without taxation or penalties to another qualified retirement plan, including a 401(k) at your next company if that's allowed, or to an individual retirement account, Levit said. If your former employer isn't forcing a transfer, there's no need to rush into this decision.

While cashing out your 401(k) is another option, it's not a desirable one, Levit said: ""The distribution is taxable as ordinary income,"" and ""depending on the employee's age, there could also be penalties for an 'early withdrawal.'""

Laid-off workers who have an outstanding loan from their 401(k) may face an extra headache, Levit said.

""401(k) loans are typically due in full at termination,"" she said. ""If they are not repaid, the outstanding loan will be considered a taxable distribution subject to ordinary income taxes and potentially penalties.""

But it's worth talking to your plan administrator and learning what your options are, Levit added: ""Some have flexibility about continuing payments even after termination.""

People who've lost a job and are worried about their student loan bill have options, too. You can enroll in an income-driven repayment plan that sets your monthly payment based on your earnings and submit proof that you've lost your job; while unemployment benefits will count as income, you're likely to get a low payment and some may not owe anything under their plan's terms.

The U.S. Department of Education also offers an Unemployment Deferment, in which you can possibly pause your payments for up to three years after a job loss. Some student loans will still accrue interest during the payment pause, while others will not.

During a period of joblessness, you should ask other lenders ""for a break,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate.

""Many lenders have hardship programs that allow you to skip a payment or rearrange a due date,"" Rossman said. ""Lenders are often willing to work with you, especially if it's something temporary like a government shutdown, job loss or natural disaster.""

If you can manage it, making at least the minimum payments on all of your debts will avoid the start of any collection activity and possible risks to your credit, Rossman added.

On top of taking care of your finances, it's also important to tend to your mental health after a job loss, Evermore said. That might mean sharing what you're going through with others, including family, friends and a therapist.

""Unemployment is one of the most stressful things that can happen to a person, so be mindful of the fact that you are not alone,"" Evermore said. ""There are people who want to help you through this challenging time.""

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Berkshire Hathaway's third-quarter earnings are out Saturday morning. Operating earnings jumped and Buffett continued to build the cash hoard. You can view the details here.

Two months from now Warren Buffett will no longer be Berkshire's CEO and investors appear to be getting increasingly nervous about the year-end transition.

On May 2, the Friday before Buffett's surprise announcement at the annual meeting that he plans to step down, Berkshire's B shares closed at an all-time high just under $540 per share.

At that point, they were outperforming the S&P 500 by 22.4 percentage points for the year.

Today, they are 10.9 percentage points behind the benchmark index, a slight improvement from Wednesday's 12.2 percentage point gap, the biggest so far in 2025. 

The B shares have dropped 11.5% since Buffett broke the news. That's still above their early August low when they were down almost 15%, but below their near-term closing high of almost $507 on September 4.

Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods are especially worried.

In a report dated October 26, they lowered their rating on Berkshire's A shares to ""underperform"" (sell) from ""market perform"" (hold) and lowered their price target to $700,000 from $740,000.

The stock closed today at $715,740.

Under the headline, ""Many Things Moving in the Wrong Direction,"" Meyer Shields and Jing Li write, ""We believe GEICO's likely underwriting margin peak, declining property catastrophe reinsurance rates, lower short-term interest rates, tariff-related pressure on the rails, and the risk of fading alternative energy tax credits will drive underperformance over the next 12 months.""

They attribute the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P and other insurance stocks in recent months ""mostly"" to Buffett's May announcement.

There is also what they call Berkshire's ""historically unique succession risk"" that reflects ""Buffett's likely unrivaled reputation and what we see as unfortunately inadequate disclosure that will probably deter investors once they can no longer rely on Mr. Buffett's presence at Berkshire Hathaway.""

That is, Berkshire doesn't operate like most other corporations, in part because it doesn't issue forecasts or meet with analysts, but investors felt they could trust Buffett. Without him, Wall Street probably won't give the company and new CEO Greg Abel as much leeway.

In an article with a headline about Berkshire's ""New Normal ... No 'Buffett Premium,'"" the Wall Street Journal quotes KBW's Shields as saying, ""There are people that have developed enormous confidence in Warren Buffett. For them, that's where the investment thesis starts and stops.""

As a counterpoint, though, the Journal has Semper Augustus Investments Group president Chris Bloomstran arguing Berkshire was overvalued just before the May meeting, and that its YTD gain of more than 5% is significantly better than GEICO's rival, Progressive, which is down 14%.

He's been buying the stock and doesn't think Buffett's job shift is pushing the shares lower. ""Everybody I know inside the Berkshire world has nothing but rave reviews and good things to say about Greg.""

And the Northstar Group's Henry Asher told the paper that even if Abel's stock picking ability doesn't match Buffett's incredible record, Berkshire's operating companies won't change.

""You're not going to cancel your shipment on the Burlington Northern because Buffett isn't there. The businesses will continue to produce mammoth amounts of cash flow, with or without Buffett.""

The Journal's article also confirms what we expected: Greg Abel will be writing the annual letter to shareholders starting next year.

(Buffett has already said he won't be on stage for next May's meeting in his role as chairman.)

Buffett clearly foreshadowed the authorship change when he wrote in this year's letter, before his May announcement, that ""it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters.""

He will, however, have letters to his three children and to shareholders on November 10, presumably to accompany the gifts to family foundations that have become a Thanksgiving tradition in recent years.

In a filing this week, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it sold 401,514 shares of DaVita for $54 million on Monday.

DVA shares are down almost 8% this week after the dialysis company's third quarter earnings came in below analysts' expectations as patient costs increased and the volume of treatments declined.

For the year, the stock is down more than 20%.

This week's relatively small sale, however, is almost certainly not a reaction to the stock's weakness.

In a 2024 agreement with DaVita, Berkshire promised to keep its stake at or below 45% of the company's outstanding shares.

In DaVita's quarterly report this week, it reported that buybacks have reduced its outstanding shares from 75.5 million to 70.6 million, which would have increased Berkshire's stake to 45.6%.

By cutting its share total to 31.8 million shares, (currently valued at $3.8 billion), Berkshire brings the stake percentage back to exactly 45.0%.

It has done similar sales in recent quarters to stay at the agreed upon level.

Warren Buffett says the natural course of almost all governments is to devalue their currencies, and that's ""scary.""

WARREN BUFFETT: We wouldn't want to be owning anything that we thought was in a currency that was really going to hell. And that's the big thing we worry about with the United States currency.

I mean, the tendency of a government to want to debase its currency over time is — there's no system that beats that.

You can pick dictators, you can pick representatives, you can do anything.

But — but the people — there will be a push toward weaker currencies.

And of course, that is — I mentioned very briefly in the annual report that fiscal policy is what scares me in the United States because it's made the way it is.

And all the motivations are to doing a lot of things that will cause — can cause trouble with money.

But that's not limited to the United States. It's all over the world. And some places, it gets out of control, regularly.

You know, they devalue at rates that are breathtaking, and that's continued. I mean, and you — people can study economics, and you can have all kinds of arrangements.

But in the end, if you've got people that control the currency, you can issue paper money and you will, or you can engage in clipping currencies like they used to centuries ago.

There will always be people — it's the nature of their job, I'm not singling them out as particularly evil or anything like that.

But the natural course of government is to make the currency worth less over time, and that's got important consequences.

And it's very hard to build checks and balances into the system to keep that from happening.

And we've had a lot of fun here in the last — either the first hundred days [of the second Trump administration] or the last hundred days, whatever you want to call it — watching what happens when people try to make sure that they aren't running fiscal risks.

And that game isn't over, and never will be over, you know, in finality.

If you look up and search the great inflations of post-World War II, it's just a list that goes on forever and the same names keep popping up and everything.

So, currency is — the value of currency is a scary thing.

Activist Commentary: Impactive Capital is an activist hedge fund founded in 2018 by Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Alejandro Asmar. Impactive Capital is an active ESG investor that launched with a $250 million investment from CalSTRS and now has approximately $3 billion. In just seven years, they have made quite a name for themselves as AESG investors. Wolfe and Asmar realized that there was an opportunity to use tools, notably on the social and environmental side, to drive returns. Impactive focuses on positive systemic change to help build more competitive, sustainable businesses for the long run. Impactive will use traditional operational, financial and strategic tools that activists use, but will also implement ESG change that they believe is material to the business and drives profitability of the company and shareholder value. Impactive looks for high quality businesses that are usually complex and mispriced, where they can underwrite a minimum of a high teens or low 20% internal rate of return over a three- to five-year holding period, and have active engagement with management to set up multiple ways to win.

On Oct. 21, Impactive said they had taken a position in Advanced Drainage Systems.

Advanced Drainage Systems is the market share leader in plastic stormwater and onsite septic wastewater management solutions. The company is a pioneer in the development and manufacturing of plastic drainage products, primarily utilizing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene. Recycled materials made up 46% of WMS' purchased inputs in fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest recyclers in North America. The company has three primary business lines: (i) Pipe - storm and drainage pipe, 56% of FY25 revenue; (ii) Allied Products - complementary products to its pipe offerings like storm chambers, structures and fittings, 26%; and (iii) Infiltrator - chambers, tanks and advanced wastewater treatment solutions, 18%. Between its three segments, the company has a $15 billion addressable market and is the clear industry leader with 75% to 95% market share across its segments.

There is a lot to like about WMS, as it is an extremely high-quality and well-run company with a long history of compounding growth and secular tailwinds. As a result, WMS has an impressive track record, having grown earnings per share almost 10x since its initial public offering, and has a 28% EPS compound annual growth rate with returns on invested capital consistently above 20%. Management is also very focused on shareholder value and are great capital allocators, increasing dividends and launching buybacks in most years where it does not see a compelling M&A opportunity. 

Despite this, the company's share price performance has been lackluster over the past 1- and 3-year periods, underperforming the Russell 2000, and its stock has re-rated down to a P/E multiple in the low-to-mid 20s. The reason for this is twofold: investor fears regarding the cyclicality of construction spending and margin compression. However, Impactive Capital believes that both concerns appear to be overblown or misplaced and that management has built this business to protect its top line from market cyclicality and make margin expansion structural, not cyclical. 

As to the cyclicality of construction spending, construction spending is down 3% year to date as higher interest rates and affordability concerns have dampened residential and non-residential construction spending, setting this up to be the worst year for construction in the past two decades aside from the global financial crisis. But company revenue has not been declining and is not expected to decline for several reasons. 

First, plastic pipes have been stealing market share from concrete and steel. Only about 20% of the market in 2010, plastic now exceeds 40% due to it being 20% cheaper than alternatives and offering superior performance. 

Second, with the 2019 acquisition of Infiltrator and the upcoming acquisition of National Diversified Sales, WMS has increased its exposure to the residential repair and remodel end-market, adding resiliency to its revenue streams. This should also make WMS a natural beneficiary of the reversion in existing home sales, which are currently at a 15-year low. 

Third, billion-dollar storm events have quintupled since the 1980s, necessitating increased investment in resiliency and more complex stormwater infrastructure. The company also has a wide moat, enabled by its high brand loyalty from contractors, its vertical integration and excellent distribution network. 

As for margin concerns, there are fears that weakness in construction will lead to margin compression. However, this is something else that management has taken a lot of steps and adopted many initiatives to avoid. Over the past six years, the company has been diversifying its business toward its higher-margin Allied Product and Infiltrator offerings, both of which have adjusted operating margins in the mid-50s, whereas pipe is around 30%. 

Additionally, one of its largest input costs are oil and resin, and WMS has a unique way to mitigate these costs. The company toggles between recycled and virgin resins depending on the price of oil. So, when oil spikes, they use recycled resin, and when it drops, they switch to virgin resin and capture better margins. WMS is the only one of its competitors who can do this at scale. Moreover, when construction is weak, oil and resin prices tend to decline. So, loss to the top line can be made up on the bottom line as the decline in resin prices is more than enough to offset end-market weaknesses (i.e., construction spending is down about 3% YTD, resin prices are down 15% to 20%). As a result, pipe and Allied Products adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded by about 8 percentage points since 2020, but some fear that this will eventually normalize.

However, Impactive believes that this shift is structural, not cyclical and WMS will not only avoid margin compression but could see gross margin expand by 100 bps over the next 12-24 months; something that is not factored into forward consensus estimates.

As a result of this confluence of factors, Impactive models that WMS will return to mid-teens EPS growth and projects a base case three-year total return and IRR of 69% and 19%, respectively, and an upside case of 146% and 34%, respectively.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","America's food trucks are nearing $3 billion business, but the road to success is getting rougher","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/01/food-truck-restaurant-billion-dollar-business-keys-success-costs.html","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 14:08:22 GMT","



Food trucks have boomed in visibility and influence, but the road to success is getting rougher. According to a recent report from IBIS, food trucks are approaching the $3 billion annual revenue mark across over 92,000 businesses in the U.S. and are projected to keep growing over the next five years. But once seen as a scrappy alternative to brick-and-mortar restaurants, today's mobile kitchens are navigating many of the same financial pressures that traditional restaurants are facing. While the total number of food trucks is projected to grow in the years ahead by 17%, revenue growth for 2025 is estimated by IBIS to be a mere 0.2% and on the decline.

More cities are embracing food trucks due to a variety of factors, including consumers' increasing demands for innovative, affordable dining options, back-to-office mandates, and bureaucratic easing of regulations. However, inflation and tariffs mean operators are experiencing rising costs, from transportation to ingredients, often risking the push of menu prices to a breaking point for consumers.

For trucks, it is not just imported food staples, but new tariffs on imported aluminum and steel in the trucks and equipment.

Fast food and casual restaurants have seen menu prices increasing in the 5% range. Items that were once under $10 are now an average of $11.56, according to a recent Lending Tree report, and food consumers are pushing back. Chipotle recently reported weak results that sank its stock and can at least partially be attributed to consumer perceptions about rising menu prices across-the-board that have hurt sales, its executives said on an earnings call this week.

""It's been affecting us a lot,"" said Angel Ruiz, general manager of Birria-Landia, a New York City-based food truck that launched in 2019 with multiple locations across the city's boroughs. ""Prices are going up around 30% for some ingredients,"" he said. ""We try to balance those costs so it doesn't impact the customer's pocket,"" he added.

The Queens-based food truck, which was recently named the second-best taco spot in America, according to Yelp, recently upped prices 12.5%.

Some experts say the idea that food trucks are by their nature cheaper was always a false one. Social media savvy food trucks with unique menus can and do get customers to the counter with elevated prices.

""The mainstream food truck, with branding, apps, and culinary innovation are always $10 and up,"" said Sandipan Sen, professor of marketing at Southeast Missouri State University. ""Typically, food trucks are between fast food and a reasonably priced fine dining restaurant.""

In his view, a menu increase of a dollar or two linked to cost pressures will not be a dealbreaker for many food truck enthusiasts. ""The commercial food trucks were never meant to just be cheap,"" he said.

Cities are becoming more friendly toward food trucks as an established part of the local culture, and more events are being designed with food trucks in mind. But despite relatively low startup costs compared to restaurants, running a food truck comes with major logistical hurdles. ""A lot of people think it is easy,"" Ruiz said. ""But the truck itself can cost around $160,000 to $170,000, plus permits and insurance.""

Industry estimates put truck costs anywhere from $120,000 to $200,000.

Along with purchasing the truck, managing one can drain operators' wallets before they ever open to sell their first meal. In fact, ""the biggest misconception people have is that a food truck is a cheap restaurant on wheels,'"" said Ben Goldberg, co-founder and president of the New York Food Truck Association. ""You're talking about managing a mobile restaurant: purchasing the truck, outfitting the truck with kitchen equipment, obtaining all kinds of insurance, and health department permits,"" Goldberg said.

Red tape can be a significant challenge. ""Between health department requirements, commissary regulations, parking restrictions, fire suppression standards, and individual event permits, the process can feel overwhelming,"" Goldberg said. ""On top of this, there are parking challenges, staffing complexities, and many other pitfalls, all while competing in some of the busiest and most regulated cities in the country.""

""You have to make sure you get your spot every night. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not,"" Ruiz said, explaining that the only way to ensure you get your spot is to park your car there throughout the day.

""They need to have a back up plan for everything,"" said Sen. ""If the main chef falls ill, who runs the show that day? They need to train alternates to run the operations."" 

It is not uncommon for a food truck to be a one-person business. And they have unique commuting and seasonal challenges. ""They need back up street routes if the current routes are not working on a certain day. They need to have collaborations with complementary business, especially during winter months,"" Sen said. He added that the use of technology and social media in particular is key to finding a way to operate in winter ""when there may not be a lot of crowd waiting to be served.""

There was a time earlier in the food truck industry's history when Goldberg says he would have described the businesses as being built around strictly affordable options, but ""the industry has evolved,"" he said.

Quality, creativity, and access are now more important to consumers, and ""even though prices have increased slightly in recent years (due to inflation, tariffs, etc.), a food truck lunch is still less expensive than the average quick service or sit down meal in New York City,"" he said.  

With the profit margin of food trucks averaging 5% between 2020-2025, according to IBIS, some food truck owners have turned to catering or private event service to diversify their business, changing the model of ""accessible"" dining to meet the current moment, supplementing core truck sales with weddings, corporate events, and partnerships that have helped to keep street pricing accessible, according to Goldberg.

""Your truck isn't just your kitchen, it's your brand. Think about design, customer experience, and storytelling from day one. A great food truck isn't just serving food; it's creating moments that people remember and share,"" Goldberg said. And the extension of that brand into events is becoming more critical for sales success. ""Many of our most successful members generate the majority of their revenue through private events, brand activations, and catering, not street vending,"" Goldberg said. 

The traditional restaurant and truck models are also converging in some cases, Birria-Landia among them. It's planning to open its first brick-and-mortar location in Flushing, Queens, in the Tangram Mall, which is home to retail, dining, and entertainment.

That should not be a surprise, according to Sen: ""Most [food truck] ventures that have survived for more than five years either have a brick-and-mortar presence or were originally a brick-and-mortar restaurant and the food truck is an offshoot,"" he said. ""Food trucks are not a long term business,"" he said. ""Don't be surprised if your favorite food truck goes out of business, or decides to be brick-and-mortar, or becomes a catering service.""

IBIS says ""American"" cuisine remains the largest driver of annual food truck revenue, at roughly $1.3 billion, followed by dessert trucks, Central and South American cuisine, and Asian cuisine. What are called fusion trucks are also trending, such as Roy Choi's Kogi BBQ, and New York's Korilla BBQ, blending Asian and Mexican cuisines.

Goldberg says food trucks often lead the way with new cuisines. ""Trucks are where you find mashups, global flavors, and seasonal specialties you can't always get in brick-and-mortar spots. So while affordability and convenience remain core, the experience: discovering something new, eating outdoors, connecting with the chef directly is what makes food trucks so special today,"" he said.

""It's a lot of work. You just have to be passionate and careful,"" said Ruiz, who has been in the restaurant industry for two decades. ""If you make good food, you always will have people that come back.""

But the first step in eventual success is the blocking and tackling of the business model. ""Success starts with understanding your concept's economics, local demand, and operational logistics,"" Goldberg said.

More consumers are buying travel insurance during the federal government shutdown — but these insurance policies may not offer the catch-all protection that buyers expect.

Much depends on the fine print, experts said.

Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, has seen the volume of insurance quotes increase 8.5% year-over-year between Oct. 1 and 27. Sales have risen by 7.9% over the same period.

Buyers seem to be hedging against the financial risk of the government shutdown upending their travel plans, experts said. Air traffic controllers and TSA agents are essential government employees working without pay, and in previous shutdowns, travel has been disrupted.

Hopper, a travel website, has seen purchases of ""disruption assistance,"" which offers certain protections in the event of flight cancellations or delays, increase 35% between mid-September (before the shutdown) and early October (after it began).

""We see it time and again when flight delays or cancellations are in the news a lot,"" Patrick Steadman, Hopper's head of disruption assistance.

""Essential"" workers like air traffic controllers and TSA agents work without pay during a shutdown, while others are furloughed. That raises the odds of staff shortages and resulting airport delays.

Flight delays have already increased during the shutdown, and airlines have warned in recent weeks of likely flight delays the longer the political impasse drags on.

The shutdown, which started Oct. 1, is already the second-longest in U.S. history.

Meanwhile, the end-of-year holidays, historically among the busiest seasons for travel, are fast-approaching. For example, more than 3 million people were screened at U.S. airports on the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2024, breaking a single-day record.

Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead.

About 45% of Americans plan to spend money on flights or hotels this holiday season, according to a NerdWallet poll published in October. They expect to spend an average $2,586 for such expenses, and a collective $311 billion, it found.

""Ultimately, [travel] is (in our mind) what probably brings this shutdown to a close,"" Chris Krueger, a strategist at Washington Research Group, wrote in a note Oct. 29. ""Once TSA begins missing paychecks, airport lines (and coverage) will likely force resolution like in previous shutdowns,"" he wrote.

Air traffic controllers, already in short supply, missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday.

The longest U.S. shutdown, during President Donald Trump's first term in office, lasted 35 days and came to an end after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area. TSA screeners called out sick in elevated numbers as they were asked to work without pay.

Flight delays or cancellations may, in certain cases, lead consumers to shoulder unforeseen costs for lodging and meals, or miss out on prepaid activities like tours, for example.

But travel insurance won't always cover consumers for such costs if the shutdown upends their itineraries.

For example, travelers likely wouldn't be covered if they miss a flight due to being stuck in a long airport security line, said Terra Baykal, senior marketing manager at World Nomads, a travel insurer.

She recommends people arrive at least three hours before departure, even for domestic flights, as the shutdown persists to prevent long lines from derailing a trip.

World Nomads typically sees its insurance sales fall at this time of year, but they have declined less than usual with the shutdown, Baykal said.

In 2024, the company saw a 17% drop in U.S. travel insurance plans sold, from the Sept. 5 to 30 period to Oct. 1 to 26. They dropped by a lesser amount, 10%, this year, suggesting there's been more demand amid the shutdown, Baykal said.

Travel insurance is largely meant to cover unforeseeable events, said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Squaremouth.

However, the shutdown is now a foreseeable event, Valdez said. That means policies purchased on or after Oct. 1 likely wouldn't cover certain claims.

For example, a federal worker who bought travel insurance after Oct. 1 and then subsequently was laid off or furloughed due to the shutdown may not be able to cancel their trip and claim insurance benefits under a ""cancel for work reasons"" clause, Valdez said.

Travelers can get indirect coverage during the shutdown in some cases, depending on their insurance policy and airlines' stated rationale for a flight disruption, experts said.

Most insurers require there be a ""common carrier"" disruption, like a mechanical failure, in order to pay benefits, Valdez said.

As long as an airline categorizes any sort of disruption — such as a lack of air traffic controllers — as a ""common carrier"" delay or interruption, travelers may qualify for insurance reimbursement, wrote Squaremouth spokesperson Lauren McCormick in a recent blog post.

""Even during a government shutdown, many disruptions to travel are covered under the 'common carrier' category,"" she wrote. ""Essentially, this is a loophole that may allow you to claim reimbursement as an indirect result of the shutdown,"" she added.

There are generally caveats and limits to travel insurance policies, too, such as dollar limits on certain benefits and the requirement that a delay last for a minimum amount of time.

Certain optional policy benefits, like ""cancel for any reason"" provisions, may grant travelers additional flexibility if they want to cancel an upcoming trip rather than risk the headache of a delay or cancellation, said Baykal, of World Nomads.

However, these benefits also come with caveats: For example, many insurers require policyholders to cancel at least two days before their trip starts. Insurers also generally don't reimburse policyholders for the full cost of the trip; they may reimburse 75% of nonrefundable trip costs, for example, Baykal said.

""We always recommend a customer reads through policy details if it comes to the point of making a claim,"" she said.

Separately, airlines have made varying financial commitments to travelers who experience flight disruptions, which are detailed on a dashboard maintained by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent marked the 17th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper on Friday with a post on X praising the network's resilience and adding a jab at Senate Democrats, saying the system “never shuts down” and implying lawmakers could “learn something from that.” The comment doubled as a policy signal and a partisan elbow.

Oct. 31 carries special weight in crypto. It is the date Satoshi Nakamoto released the nine-page Bitcoin white paper in 2008, the document that sketched a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and set the stage for a network that has run continuously since January 2009. Supporters use the anniversary to highlight bitcoin's always-on design and its independence from any single operator.

Bessent's note slots into a year of crypto-forward messaging from Treasury. 

In July, following President Trump's signature on the GENIUS Act, Bessent called stablecoins “a revolution in digital finance” and argued that an internet-native dollar rail could reinforce reserve-currency status while expanding access to dollar payments. Treasury published that statement on its website. 

In August, Bessent said on X that bitcoin forfeited to the U.S. would seed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and that Treasury would explore budget-neutral ways to add more, signaling interest in building holdings without new appropriations. 

Reaction to Friday's post exposed familiar rifts inside crypto. 

Long-time Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr pushed back, saying bitcoin is “weaker than ever,” a nod to disputes over recent software releases and what they mean for network purity. 

Researcher Eric Wall replied with sarcasm that “bitcoin died after the core v30 release,” poking at recurrent doom takes after upgrades. 

Investor Simon Dixon reframed Bessent's line as a critique of currency policy, arguing that bitcoin's point is protection from political debasement. 

Others pressed for policy action: trader Fred Krueger quipped that Treasury should buy for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and digital-asset strategist Gabor Gurbacs urged putting bitcoin “on the balance sheet.” 

The replies split roughly into two camps — technical purists contesting blanket claims of resilience, and market participants pressing Treasury to turn rhetoric into acquisition policy.

The political edge was sharpened by timing. The federal government has been in a partial shutdown since Oct. 1 after Congress missed fiscal 2026 appropriations, resulting in roughly 900,000 furloughs, about 2 million employees working without pay, and curtailed operations at agencies including the NIH and CDC. The episode is the 11th shutdown to curtail services and is described as the longest full shutdown on record. 

Read narrowly, Bessent's post saluted a network that runs on weekends and holidays. Read politically, it contrasted bitcoin's uptime with a Congress stuck on funding bills — another sign that the Treasury chief intends to keep digital assets in the policy conversation on Washington's busiest days.

Something went wrong

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan says Solana price could follow a path similar to Bitcoin over time. He argues that both assets may benefit from the same broad forces shaping the digital-value market.

Hougan outlined two key drivers behind Bitcoin's valuation. First, the store-of-value market continues to grow as investors look for alternatives to traditional assets.

Second, Bitcoin could capture a larger share of that market as it matures. Hougan said that if the market simply doubled and Bitcoin kept its current share, its price would likely rise in line with that expansion.

If Bitcoin's share climbed toward 50% similar to gold's standing, he believes the price could reach about $6.5 million per coin.

He said the same logic could work for Solana. In his view, the chain now serves as a base layer for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets, areas he believes could grow many times from here. Hougan has also argued that the new US exchange-traded products could help Solana push to fresh highs.

Bitwise launched its spot SOL ETF on October 28 under the ticker BSOL. Grayscale rolled out its own version the next day, listed as GSOL.

The two funds brought in about $154 million in their first sessions. Together, they now manage roughly $439 million in SOL exposure, or about 0.4% of the token's circulating supply.

The number of addresses that were active in the last day was approximately 2.0-2.9 million, which indicates that people are not interested in a burst of activities, but in consistent ones.

The volume of the DEX was approximately 3.9 billion every day, and the total for the seven days amounted to approximately 28-31 billion. That indicates excellent liquidity levels and continued engagement within the trading ecosystem of Solana.

Spot trading over the past day reached about $690.65 million, while futures volume came in around $11.05 billion. SOL is trading around one of the vital support levels, and the price movement indicates stable purchases.

One of the analysts provided a chart that shows that buyers have intervened several times within the range of about $260-$270. Any test of this zone has signaled a bounce, indicating that dip-buyers are still at task and are ready to protect the level.

Price action has turned steady again. The token is trading above short-term trend levels, including the rising 20-day moving average, which has begun to turn up.

(Source: X)

Recent candles show higher lows through the week, a sign that buyers are stepping back in. Trading activity has also evened out after the pullback, suggesting sellers are losing their grip.

The next hurdle sits near $295. The chart shows several attempts to move past this zone, but each push has been rejected. A clean break and close above that level would point to further strength.

The analyst says a move through $295 opens the door toward $400, close to an earlier supply pocket around $390–$410, where price stalled earlier this year.

RSI is climbing from mid-range, leaving room for price to stretch before it hits overheated levels. If the trend breaks down, support around $250–$255 could act as a safety net. For now, the structure still leans higher.

Bitcoin disappointed traders in October, failing to meaningfully break above its previous all-time highs even as the Federal Reserve started the countdown to a bitcoin price game-changer.

The bitcoin price has dropped back from a peak of $126,000 per bitcoin, sparking fears of a $100,000 ""death knell.""

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, U.S Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has issued a surprise bitcoin endorsement, triggering speculation he's sending the market a “signal.”

“17 years after the white paper, the bitcoin network is still operational and more resilient than ever,” Bessent posted to X, adding: “Bitcoin never shuts down,"" in a jab at the U.S. Democratic Party over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown—“Senate Democrats could learn something from that.”

The bitcoin white paper, published by the anonymous person or group of people going by Satoshi Nakamoto on October 31 2008, is just nine pages long and outlines how the bitcoin network would work.

Bessent's comments were seized on by bitcoin and crypto traders as a sign that the Trump administration remains committed to the technology.

“Pay attention to the signals. This is a signal,” James Lavish, a director at bitcoin treasury company and asset manager Strive, posted to X.

In August, Bessent triggered bitcoin price volatility when he suggested the U.S. government wouldn't buy more bitcoin for president Donald Trump's promised U.S. bitcoin reserve to rival its gold reserve, as well as revealing the U.S. holds far fewer bitcoin than previously thought.

Bessent sought to clarify his comments on X, saying: ""Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the president's promise to make the United States the 'bitcoin superpower of the world,'"" and calling the “bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government ... the foundation of the strategic bitcoin reserve that president Trump established in his March executive order.”

Since then, president Donald Trump has been revealed to be one of America's largest bitcoin investors and has recommitted to making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

Meanwhile, many bitcoin and crypto market traders are betting the bitcoin price rally expected in October will now happen in the final two months of the year, pointing to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continuing to buy more bitcoin and the Federal Reserve further cutting interest rates.

“Our base case sees bitcoin rising towards $140,000, with total ETF inflows between $10 and $15 billion not being surprising,” analysts with the cryto exchange Bitfinex said in emailed comments.

“Our view is that October demonstrated resilience, with an all-time-high crash and rebound marking a reset in the bull cycle. November may extend gains towards the $140,000 base case as ETFs and a dovish Fed policy support momentum. For most investors, bitcoin continues to serve as a hedge amid currency volatility.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

A lot of estimates are converging on the same price target, but does it matter?

Despite being fairly arbitrary, price targets are often a powerful driver of investor psychology and behavior. When enough people repeat a round number frequently enough, the market starts treating it like a finish line, even if it's never reached or inherently unreachable. Right now, the chatter about Bitcoin's (BTC +1.24%) price potentially reaching $200,000 within the next 12 months has the same tenor.

The trouble is that such finish lines in investing tend to move from month to month as sentiment shifts. So is there an argument for loading up on Bitcoin as long as it's priced at less than $200,000 per coin?





Let's start by taking inventory of a few serious estimates about Bitcoin's price between now and the end of 2026.

Bitwise Asset Management's 2025 outlook, published in late 2024, called for Bitcoin to trade above $200,000 by the end of this year, citing the expanding spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) footprint and mainstream distribution as catalysts. It also sees the coin's price surpassing $1 million in or by 2029.

Similarly, the bank Standard Chartered's digital assets team estimated early this month that there is a path to the coin reaching $200,000 at the very end of 2025, recently highlighting ETF inflows and shrinking float as key supports.

The brokerage company Bernstein proposed a $200,000 target for Bitcoin this market cycle as well, framing it as a high-conviction base case and, if anything, conservative given institutional adoption and ETF momentum. Given that this Bitcoin cycle is approaching its final 12 months or so out of its four-year cadence, with the halving in April 2024 marking approximately the midpoint, that would put Bernstein's calculation more or less in line with the timing of the others.

So with these three predictions in hand, and many others converging largely within the same ball park regarding the same price target, time frame, catalysts, and drivers, it's clear many in the crypto industry are betting on Bitcoin hitting $200,000 relatively soon.

If you believe Bitcoin's long-run value is driven by rising adoption meeting capped supply that becomes scarcer as time passes, the rational move is to buy it consistently via dollar-cost averaging regardless of headlines, price estimates, or its actual price. That lemma is true if Bitcoin's price is rising or falling, and it's true whether the coin or the wider market is experiencing a bull market, choppy prices, or a bear market.

From this perspective, you should indeed be buying Bitcoin while it's priced at under $200,000. And when its price does pass that benchmark, once again, the best move is to keep buying it. This line of reasoning may seem tautological, but here's why it makes sense.

Bitcoin's supply is structurally guaranteed to tighten roughly every four years as a result of the halving. After the most recent halving, daily issuance fell to around 450 coins, cutting new supply by half, as the name implies. There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, many of which have been lost or rendered inaccessible. So, as long as there is a consistent level of demand, perhaps from the coin's hardcore evangelists -- and there are more of those than ever before, and with more money than ever before, too -- its price will continue to rise over the long run.

There's no financial advantage to waiting for the coin to cross an arbitrary price point before buying or ceasing your purchases. The incentive is always to secure some of the supply before it gets harder to come by, and thus more expensive. Don't try to time the market. The point of spreading out your purchases via dollar-cost averaging is to ensure that you capture the value of the trend without experiencing the emotional difficulties associated with accidentally making a big investment when the coin's price is at a four-year high and, unbeknownst to you, on the verge of a major correction downward.

Another key truth is that none of this purchasing strategy guarantees a smooth ride, even if it makes dealing with the bumps in the road a bit easier psychologically. Reaching $200,000 might take longer than the bulls expect.

So pick an amount that fits your budget, automate buys weekly or monthly, and extend your holding period to years, not months. If your plan includes opportunistic extra purchases on big pullbacks, set those rules now, too. Years from now, you'll have long forgotten about the price targets of the past, as the coin's price will almost certainly have surpassed them anyway.

""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" author Robert Kiyosaki believes the global financial sector could experience a massive crash in November. He stated this in a post on his X account, which has over 2.8 million followers.

Robert Kiyosaki warns of global financial meltdown

The 10th month of the year has been dubbed ""Uptober"" in crypto circles due to its historical precedence of impressive rallies. However, it did not live up to expectations in 2025, as the prices of cryptocurrency assets fluctuated, leading many to suffer losses, prompting the forecast from Robert Kiyosaki.

According to the author, the financial market will witness a major downturn with severe consequences for investors. He predicted that millions will be wiped out, especially for those who have continued to invest in traditional assets like stocks or savings in banks.

MASSIVE CRASH BEGININING: Millions will be wiped out. Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you. 

Take care

The renowned author is suggesting that conventional investments may lose significant value. This could result in many losing their wealth as the market experiences a crash.

Kiyosaki offered an alternative to investors and those willing to protect their funds from the looming massive crash.

""Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you,"" he stated.

Kiyosaki is promoting these assets as alternatives to traditional investments in stocks, bonds or savings in fiat currency. More importantly, he listed Bitcoin BTCUSD and Ethereum ETHUSD as digital alternative assets that could serve as a hedge against inflation.

This implies that he is optimistic that Bitcoin and Ethereum will outperform traditional assets in the wake of the anticipated market crash. Hence, these two could prevent investors from suffering huge financial losses during the economic meltdown.

Interestingly, this is not the first time that Kiyosaki has shown support for both digital assets. In October, while criticizing the 60/40 rule that leans toward stocks and bonds, he also picked BTC and ETH as better alternatives for long-term investments.

The author maintained that bonds are risky assets and fiat currency is now fake money as it is no longer backed by gold. Hence, he advised against betting on stocks and bonds.

Bitcoin and Ethereum market outlook

As of this writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading up by 0.24% and 1.14%, respectively.

Bitcoin is changing hands at $110,081.79 after it climbed from a low of $108,596.10 to peak at $111,031.82 in earlier trading sessions. The trading volume remained down by 30.17% at $45.85 billion.

Ethereum is changing hands at $3,876.06 after climbing from an opening low of $3,807.41. Its trading volume is also down by 15.45% at $32.29 billion.

Battle lines redrawn with Ethereum as a modular settlement layer and Solana as a unified execution layer.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The debate pitting Ethereum versus Solana as rival L1s misses how radically their architectures diverged in 2025. Ethereum evolved into a settlement layer for modular rollups, while Solana doubled down on monolithic throughput.

Ethereum abandoned the monolithic-chain race years ago, as its roadmap treats the base layer as settlement infrastructure. At the same time, execution occurs on layer-2 (L2) rollups that post state roots back to the mainnet.

Solana made the opposite bet, with one unified ledger, sub-second slot times, and a proof-of-history pipeline that sequences transactions in a single global ledger.

Both paths deliver transactions that feel instant to users clicking “send,” but the security models diverge sharply once you ask what happens in the seconds, minutes, or days after that click.

The question builders face in 2026 isn't which chain runs faster in a vacuum; it's which one is more efficient in a practical application. It's about which model delivers lower friction for the application they want to build, and how much they're willing to pay, in terms of latency, complexity, or exit time, for the assurances each system provides.

Solana's architecture collapses inclusion, confirmation, and economic finality into a single 400-millisecond slot when the network runs smoothly.

Validators vote on blocks using a proof-of-history clock that timestamps transactions before consensus, allowing the network to pipeline throughput without waiting for traditional BFT round-trips.

Users see confirmation streams after two-thirds of stake votes on the block, typically within half a second, and complete finality arrives around 12 seconds later.

Jakob Povšič, co-founder of Temporal, described the user-facing result in a note:

“For most end users, a transaction is considered ‘confirmed' once two-thirds of the network have voted on its block, which takes less than half a second.”

Ethereum's modular design separates those steps. Rollups sequence transactions off-chain: Arbitrum produces blocks every 250 milliseconds, while Optimism produces blocks every two seconds. As a result, users see “soft” finality the moment the sequencer accepts the transaction.

But economic finality only arrives when the rollup posts its state root to L1 and the dispute or validity window closes.

Optimistic rollups impose seven-day challenge periods before users can withdraw to mainnet, while ZK rollups compress that to 15 minutes or a few hours by submitting validity proofs.

Will Papper, co-founder of Syndicate, argued the delay matters less than it appears. In a note, he added:

“Many instant bridges feel comfortable operating on non-finalized rollup states anyway. L2s deliver sub-second inclusion for apps that rarely bridge to L1, but applications requiring frequent mainnet settlement pay a time cost Solana avoids.”

The architecture difference reshapes how each system handles congestion, fees, and failure. On Solana, the base fee remains fixed at 5,000 lamports per signature, roughly $0.0001, while priority fees allow users to bid for inclusion during traffic spikes.

Stake-weighted quality-of-service routes high-priority transactions from known validators faster, and local fee markets prevent single hot accounts from clogging the scheduler.

Most retail transactions land under one cent. When the system fails, it fails globally: the Feb. 6, 2024, Solana halt lasted four hours and 46 minutes after a legacy loader bug forced validators to restart the cluster.

L2 fees fluctuate with Ethereum's blob market. Still, the introduction of Dencun's blob in March 2024 and Pectra's capacity increases in May 2025 drove typical “send” transactions to single-digit cents on major rollups.

The failure modes differ: an L2 sequencer going offline pauses user activity on that rollup even when Ethereum L1 operates normally.

Base's 45-minute halt in September 2023 and Optimism and Starknet's multi-hour disruptions in 2024-25 illustrate the localized risk.

Fault proofs and force-inclusion mechanisms provide escape hatches, but UX during an outage depends on whether the affected rollup has implemented those backstops.

The seven-day optimistic rollup withdrawal window exists because fraud proofs require time for validators to submit challenges if execution was incorrect.

OP Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum all enforce the delay. Papper suggested the delay has become invisible, saying that “ideally these internals are invisible from a UX perspective.”

Third-party bridges mitigate the delay by lending liquidity, allowing users to experience near-instant exits for a small fee. ZK rollups eliminate the challenge period by submitting validity proofs, allowing withdrawals in minutes to hours.

Solana has no withdrawal window because transactions settle directly on L1. The unified state means there's no secondary chain to exit from, so “finality” and “withdrawal” collapse into the same 12-second threshold.

That simplicity removes a layer of bridging trust but concentrates all failure risk in the validator client and network stack.

MEV extraction on Solana flows through Jito's block engine, which validators integrate to auction bundle space.

Stake-weighted quality of service (QoS) provides preferential treatment to high-stakes validators, thereby improving predictability for searchers but raising questions about fairness for smaller participants.

Ethereum's trajectory aims to harden inclusion guarantees at the protocol level. The 2026 “Glamsterdam” upgrade plans to enshrine proposer-builder separation and introduce inclusion lists that force proposers to include specified transactions within one or two slots.

Papper argued that inclusion guarantees matter more than single-slot finality:

“The next most beneficial item is inclusion guarantees since it allows apps to be more certain of transaction inclusion, offering better UX.”

Solana's catalyst is Firedancer, the independent validator client developed by Jump Crypto. Public demos showcased throughput far exceeding that of the current Agave client.

Povšič emphasized that the culture shift is “what's fundamentally different now from the outage risks of the past is the development culture.” He added that the core teams have adopted a security- and reliability-first approach.

Firedancer's rollout introduces client diversity, reducing single-implementation risk and pushing latency and throughput ceilings higher. The Alpenglow runtime targets sub-150-millisecond finality.

Ethereum's roadmap stacks three near-term upgrades. Pectra, delivered in May 2025, increased blob throughput. Fusaka, slated for this quarter, ships PeerDAS: a peer-based data availability sampling system that enables nodes to verify data without downloading full blobs.

Glamsterdam in 2026 brings enshrined PBS and inclusion lists, hardening censorship resistance. OP Stack chains and Arbitrum are maturing fault-proof systems that enable permissionless validation.

Papper predicted that cheaper data availability (DA) drives the most immediate gains:

“Cheaper data availability leads to lower fees. That ensures that every transaction on a rollup becomes cheaper.”

High-frequency trading and market-making demand the lowest possible time-to-inclusion. Solana's single-slot path, stake-weighted QoS, and Jito bundles deliver that when milliseconds matter.

Povšič argued the infrastructure has matured:

“We've come a long way…from an NFT mint almost bringing down the chain in late 2021 to Solana surviving the recent Black Friday without breaking a sweat.”

On-chain games and social applications that rarely settle on L1 fit L2s well. Arbitrum's 250-millisecond blocks feel instant, and post-Dencun fees compete with Solana's sub-penny economics.

Builders inherit Ethereum's settlement layer when needed. Papper noted preconfirmations compress latency further:

“I think that 200ms from preconfirmations is already imperceptible to most users.”

Payments and consumer DeFi hinge on fees and exit flows. If users rarely bridge to L1, L2 UX competes directly with Solana. If the application requires frequent mainnet settlement or atomic composability across many accounts, Solana's unified ledger simplifies the architecture.

Povšič called out the developer advantage:

“Beyond fees and performance, Solana's biggest advantage for developers is the simplicity of the global shared state. You don't have to deal with bridging or the extra complexity of data availability.”

The competitive question in 2026 isn't whether Solana or Ethereum is faster or cheaper in isolation. The question is which model better aligns with the latency, cost, and finality requirements of the application a builder wants to ship.

Solana bets that collapsing execution, settlement, and finality into one 400-millisecond slot creates the lowest-friction path, and Firedancer pushes that envelope further.

Meanwhile, Ethereum bets that separating concerns, L1 for settlement, L2s for execution, allows each layer to specialize and scale independently, with cheaper blobs and mature fault proofs narrowing the UX gap.

Users care about the composite metric: time-to-confirmed-UX multiplied by cost multiplied by reliability. Both ecosystems optimized different parts of that curve in 2025, and the 2026 upgrades will test whether monolithic throughput or modular scaling delivers the better product at scale.

The answer will depend on the application.

That's not a hedge, but rather the acknowledgment that the two models made different architectural tradeoffs, and those tradeoffs produce measurably different outcomes for different workloads.

EcoYield, Hyperliquid, and BlockDAG are among the top altcoins to buy now. The first one is a crypto presale rapidly gaining momentum and attracting participants with significant bonuses. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid is an established, large-cap altcoin that has defied the market's downtrend, posting substantial gains. Lastly, BlockDAG is nearing the end of its lengthy presale with a slight decline.

While most of the crypto market struggles with disheartening losses, these few projects sustain investor optimism with considerable progress. Let's see how far Hyperliquid can surge and why EcoYield may become this year's top presale at BlockDAG's expense.



Crypto is a highly volatile asset class that tends to swing between nauseating highs and depressing lows. While the crypto market provides plenty of opportunities, savvy investors must be comfortable with the risks inherent in the industry before committing to a new venture.

Some say that the best time to invest in crypto is when the market is in a downtrend. They call it “buying the dip,” which means purchasing an asset after its price has temporarily fallen. Others say you should jump on an accelerating bandwagon and buy crypto before its price becomes unaffordable. Neither of these two strategies is successful all the time, and many other factors can decide the best time to invest in crypto.

Your best choice is to enter the market only after doing your due diligence and having a good understanding of it. Analyzing price trends, changes in trading volume, market capitalization, rumors, and events will put you in a better starting position. This way, you can discover the best crypto to buy now.

With that in mind, let's see how some of the best-performing altcoins can provide a gateway to today's crypto market.

EcoYield is a crypto project that gives investors exposure to real yield backed by real-world assets. The company builds physical infrastructure comprising solar-powered facilities and CPU clusters that deliver highly efficient AI compute power. EcoYield generates revenue by leasing the energy it produces to AI companies and other enterprises.

Next, EcoYield uses the revenue to repay investors via on-chain stablecoin transfers directly to their wallets. This way, $EYE token buyers obtain access to real yield while also contributing to the expansion of real-world infrastructure with an eco-friendly approach.

The $EYE token is currently in the first presale round, offering buyers access to staking features, governance rights, and other perks. Furthermore, EcoYield rewards participants with a 65% bonus in Yield Tokens. This token will track each investor's contribution and proportional share of revenue. EcoYield is targeting an APY of 20-30%, depending on project IRRs.

Joining the $EYE presale today will get you 40% more $EYE tokens on your purchase through a time-limited offer. These arguably make  $EYE the best crypto to buy now.

Hyperliquid is among the few top-20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, performing well in the market. The $HYPE token seems to have ignored the broader downtrend and is continuing to rise. Currently, $HYPE is hoping to set a new ATH after soaring to $59.39 in September.

Hyperliquid is a decentralized crypto exchange that offers a wide range of tradable assets and specializes in perpetual futures trading. The platform primarily caters to expert traders, offering lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and advanced trading tools.

BlockDAG is a newcomer to the layer-1 blockchain niche. The project aims to outperform the competition by combining a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the proof-of-work (POW) consensus mechanism. This system should help developers perform high-speed, low-cost transactions and cross-chain operations within a secure, scalable environment.

The $BDAG token has been on presale for over two years, declining steadily in recent months. Many investors have passed the opportunity to onboard the project since it still doesn't have a launch date in sight.

Established crypto coins like $HYPE can generate steady growth, albeit at a slow speed. Meanwhile, long-running crypto presales like BlockDAG have an even smaller chance of delivering high returns. That's because the token's value from the last presale round is not significantly lower than the launch price.

A reliable tactic is joining a crypto presale in its early funding rounds. The EcoYield presale includes significant bonuses for first-round participants, making it one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Join the $EYE token presale today and get a 40% bonus on your purchase by using the GLOBAL40 code.

Oops, something went wrong

 Key Takeaways

Altcoin ETFs made their long-awaited debut, led by HBAR, Litecoin, and Solana.

Despite the hype, early trading shows little investor enthusiasm or liquidity.

Bitcoin remains the benchmark for institutional confidence and market depth.

Without BlackRock's involvement, altcoin ETFs may capture only 20–40% of Bitcoin's flows.

When the SEC approved the first Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs in early 2024, it marked the dawn of a new financial era.

For the first time, Wall Street institutions could legally and directly gain exposure to crypto's biggest asset. Billions poured in. Records were shattered. Bitcoin soared.

Fast forward to late 2025, and the script seems ready for a sequel — this time starring altcoins. 

The SEC has relaxed the path for altcoin-based ETFs, paving the way for funds tied to Solana (SOL), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR).

Optimism ran high: more than 90 applications for spot altcoin ETFs are currently under SEC review, and the market was buzzing about a fresh wave of institutional inflows.

But when the first funds finally launched in late October, the reception was — well — muted.

On October 29, Canary Capital launched the first U.S. spot ETFs for Litecoin and HBAR. 

The debut, however, was met with a collective shrug from investors.

The numbers told the story: zero inflows on the first trading day.

Litecoin's ETF managed about $1 million in volume, HBAR just $8 million.

Even the more talked-about Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which launched a day earlier, barely cracked $55 million in volume — respectable, but nowhere near groundbreaking.

For context, Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.6 billion in volume on day one when they launched in January.

By October 2025, they've amassed a combined $129 billion in assets, with nearly $63 billion in cumulative inflows.

That's the gulf altcoin ETFs are staring at.

To understand why altcoin ETFs are struggling, you have to start with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is more than just the first cryptocurrency; it's the only one that institutions truly trust.

Bitcoin's $2.22 trillion market capitalization dwarfs the combined $1.63 trillion value of all altcoins, which make up just 42% of total crypto market cap.

Institutions view Bitcoin as “digital gold” — a scarce, decentralized, and censorship-resistant store of value.

It's also the only crypto with over a decade of futures market surveillance, giving regulators and traders alike the data confidence they crave.

Altcoins, on the other hand, are still seen as speculative high-beta assets tied to short-term narratives like DeFi, gaming, or memes.

Data backs this up: 77% of Q3 2025 crypto inflows went to Ethereum, while Bitcoin captured the lion's share with $26.9 billion in year-to-date net inflows.

Without BlackRock's involvement, total flows into altcoin ETFs could be 50–70% lower, according to K33 Research.

That trust gap extends beyond ETFs.

Over 120 public companies collectively hold more than 1.65 million BTC, worth roughly $184 billion — nearly 8% of total Bitcoin supply.

It's a testament to Bitcoin's acceptance as a reserve asset, a status no altcoin has achieved.

While some firms are experimenting with digital asset treasuries (DATs) tied to Ethereum, Solana, and even BNB, their true resilience will only be proven when they survive their first bear market.

The regulatory overhang hasn't helped either.

While Ethereum gained clarity through the 2025 CLARITY Act, which formally classified it as a utility token, most other altcoins remain in a gray zone.

XRP still carries the baggage of its SEC lawsuit. Solana continues to battle reputational issues after repeated network outages.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, stands apart — its decentralized design immune to such scrutiny.

Add to that the macro backdrop: lingering inflation fears, tariff shocks under the Trump administration, and a global flight to safety.

In a risk-off environment, altcoins are the first to be sold and the last to recover.

There's no denying that altcoin ETFs are a step forward for the broader digital asset industry.

Analysts estimate they could bring $10–20 billion in inflows by mid-2026 — a meaningful figure, even if dwarfed by Bitcoin's numbers.

Products like Solana's staking ETF, which offers up to 7% yield, and XRP's payments-focused funds will attract niche interest from investors seeking diversification or passive income.

But until the market matures — and major institutions like BlackRock or Fidelity step in — altcoin ETFs will likely remain supporting acts in a Bitcoin-led show.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin Broke the Uptober Streak, but a Handful of Altcoins Managed to Finish Higher","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/01/bitcoin-s-red-october-what-happened-to-the-widely-anticipated-uptober-crypto-rally","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 16:25:38 GMT","

Bitcoin closed October lower, snapping its six-year “Uptober” streak while BNB eked out a gain as a mid-month jolt left most majors stuck below early highs.

The shock landed Oct. 10, when President Donald Trump threatened steep new tariffs on China amid rare-earth tensions, touching off a broad risk-off move. 

Bitcoin slid from roughly the low $120,000s toward about $105,000 in fast trade, and altcoins fell harder as thin liquidity met heavy leverage. Over Oct. 10–11, derivatives venues auto-liquidated an estimated tens of billions of dollars in positions and more than half a trillion dollars in market value evaporated before a shaky rebound set a floor. It was a macro headline colliding with crowded positioning, not a crypto-specific catalyst.

By month's end, CoinDesk Data showed bitcoin finishing October in the red, the outcome that breaks what traders call “Uptober.” 

On CoinGlass's Bitcoin Monthly Returns heat map, October 2025 is the first red October since 2018 and ends a green run that stretched from 2019 through 2024. That lore matters because the pattern persisted across very different regimes — late-cycle surges and post-sell-off recoveries alike — so a miss in 2025 resets expectations and reminds traders that seasonality is a tendency, not a promise.

The month's shape was remarkably consistent across one-month TradingView charts. 

Bitcoin started firm, suffered the synchronized Oct. 10–11 air pocket, then spent the back half of the month climbing without retaking its early peak. Ether traced the same flush-base-fade arc and stalled beneath the round-number band it tested in the first week. Solana and XRP echoed that rhythm with a sequence of lower highs into the final sessions. In practical terms, late rebounds did not flip resistance into support, which is why the monthly candles printed red for those four.

BNB broke ranks. It absorbed the mid-month downdraft, carved higher lows through the final third, and closed October higher — about 4.2% — leaving a green print while peers slipped. Outside the top 10, several names also finished October up on the screens monitored here, including ZEC, XMR, and WBTC, underscoring that pockets of strength persisted beneath the surface even as leaders cooled.

Why the “Uptober” brand stuck is straightforward. It is a community nickname born from bitcoin's tendency to post gains in October over the past decade, reinforced by that CoinGlass grid showing every October from 2019 through 2024 in the green. Flipping the cell to red this year does not erase the historical tilt, but it does nudge risk management back to tape confirmation rather than calendar confidence.

The numbers that different dashboards show can diverge for mundane reasons. CoinGlass presents calendar-month, close-to-close results that isolate October. Rolling 30-day readings on major trackers update continuously and often include early-October highs, so they can show a steeper decline into Nov. 1 even when the strict calendar month looks milder. The direction is the same; the measurement window drives the magnitude.

Marc Vanlerberghe, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, who helped launch Android at Google, drives institutional adoption of a sustainable, future‑ready blockchain. Matt Keller, Head of Impact and Inclusion and former leader at the UN World Food Programme, One Laptop per Child and the Global Learning XPRIZE, forges partnerships that expand financial access, advance environmental sustainability and build community resilience.

Here, Marc and Matt share how Algorand is scaling sustainable blockchain to support transparent, high‑integrity supply chains and next‑generation carbon and renewable markets.

Marc: Having verifiable, trusted sustainability programmes is key - and not just because many companies are under pressure from regulators and consumers to prove their sustainability claims. 

Algorand helps by giving them a way to record data about their sustainability (from product origins to the supply chain's footprint) on the blockchain, so their efforts are immutable, transparent and verifiable.

Supply chains can be fragmented and prone to fraud, making it hard to verify sustainability claims without a trusted digital infrastructure. 

Algorand addresses that gap, ensuring data integrity (tamper-proof, time-stamped records) and giving consumers and regulators confidence that claims are accurate. 

Algorand's high throughput and reliability allow it to handle complex, high-volume supply chains on a global scale.

Because Algorand itself is carbon neutral, businesses can rely on a platform that aligns with their sustainability commitments and ESG goals.

Matt: Some of the companies building on Algorand include Wholechain, which uses Algorand to provide end-to-end traceability for supply chains in industries like seafood and personal care. 

Every step of a product's journey is immutably recorded, helping prove ethical sourcing, authenticity and sustainability. 

Another one is Finboot, which works with major enterprises, including those in the oil and gas industry, to integrate blockchain into their supply chain management. 

This helps track raw materials and processes, providing a verifiable record of sustainability practices across industrial sectors.

Marc: Transparent carbon monitoring (and transparent carbon markets) are one piece of the puzzle to reducing carbon emissions, but many existing systems are siloed. 

Algorand helps companies record verified emissions data in real time on the blockchain. 

And by combining blockchain with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and AI, projects can automate monitoring, reduce costs and make verification more reliable.

This creates opportunities for both enterprises and households (usually excluded from these markets) to participate in carbon markets, turning emission reductions into credits that can be applied toward income or energy payments. 

Algorand's speed, low fees and efficiency make it possible to scale these kinds of carbon markets. 

The Algorand Foundation also shows this in practice by offsetting its own footprint every year through ClimateTrade, a marketplace built on Algorand. 

An impressive example of this is Ureca, which uses Algorand with IoT and machine learning to verify carbon reduction projects. 

Emissions data is collected and logged on Algorand in real time, creating trusted records for investors, regulators and communities. 

The platform enables households and enterprises to measure emissions, generate credits and apply them to bills or income. 

Marc: Absolutely. 

The tokenisation of renewables is what makes them more accessible to everyone, no matter where they live.

Many people cannot, for example, install rooftop solar because they live in apartments or in restricted buildings. 

Tokenisation on Algorand makes renewable energy accessible to them - meaning they can benefit from renewable energy projects - without having the direct infrastructure. 

Tokenisation allows you to create a fungible or non-fungible token version of an asset. These tokens then represent fractional ownership of an asset like solar or wind farms. 

This model creates inclusion in the green transition and makes clean energy more widely available. 

Enel, one of the largest energy utilities in the world, partnered with Conio to launch the EBITTS project on the Algorand blockchain. 

The project tokenises Enel's renewable assets, allowing consumers to purchase “Energy Utility Tokens” representing fractional ownership in solar and wind plants. 

Token holders can receive bill discounts tied to the energy their share produces and track usage through a mobile app. 

This model provides millions of people in apartments or shared housing with a direct opportunity to benefit from renewable energy. 

Enel launched in Italy, but we expect it will be replicated globally.

Marc: Algorand was designed as an environmentally friendly blockchain from the start, with sustainability built into the technology itself. 

Our consensus mechanism, Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), uses far less energy than other PoS systems (and running a node on our blockchain also requires minimal hardware, meaning our blockchain is easier to scale without massive datacenters). 

Matt: We're proud that the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI) acknowledged us for this, with our annualised CO2 use being 7x lower than Ethereum. 

And we offset our existing (minimal) footprint every year through projects purchased on ClimateTrade, with all offsets recorded transparently on-chain.

Matt: Blockchain has been questioned for its environmental impact, especially the early Proof of Work systems that required immense amounts of energy to run computations. 

This is one reason why the industry is moving toward greener models (and also why we see companies migrating to Algorand). 

Marc: Other chains are also progressing on this front, but one obstacle remains: how well these other blockchains can scale. 

As they get more traffic and add more computers to their network, that means more compute power (and electricity) is required. 

One way blockchain can continue to be more conscious is to make its hardware requirements lighter (like that of Algorand) and to take actions like purchasing offsets, so any existing carbon footprint is managed.

Decentralized applications, or dApps, are becoming increasingly prominent in the blockchain ecosystem. These applications run on blockchain networks instead of centralized servers, leveraging the security, transparency, and immutability of blockchain technology. But what role do they play in shaping the future of revenue generation within this space?

At its core, a decentralized application is software that utilizes blockchain technology to offer unique services directly to users. With their rise, we are witnessing the development of new paradigms within the blockchain space. dApps are not only engaging users but also redefining how value is generated. 

Take, for instance, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Uniswap and Aave. They are allowing users to trade and lend cryptocurrencies without intermediaries while generating revenue primarily from transaction fees. This revenue is distributed among token holders, which aligns user interests with developer goals. As of 2025, it's estimated that dApps will account for a significant portion of on-chain revenue, underscoring their growing relevance.

The revenue models employed by crypto projects are undergoing a substantial shift. In the past, transaction fees were the mainstay of blockchain revenues. Now, with the rise of dApps, there are more diverse and sustainable revenue streams being established. 

Subscription DAOs have emerged as a notable example. These decentralized autonomous organizations provide subscription services, often offering premium content or features for a fee, incentivizing token holders with discounts. They are proving effective at generating predictable recurring revenue.

There's also the model of valuing tokens held in reserves. Many projects keep a stock of their tokens, benefiting as their value appreciates. For example, DIMO rewards users for sharing vehicle data, which inherently increases the value of the tokens they hold.

Yield farming and staking are further examples of sustainable revenue generation, incentivizing users to lock tokens for rewards, consequently creating liquidity and engagement.

Lastly, there's the monetization of API access and on-chain data sales. Such strategies were once unconventional but are now generating significant revenue.

This evolution signifies a paradigm shift from singular fee-for-service models to multifaceted ecosystems where revenues come from deeply integrated incentives.

Regulatory frameworks have a profound impact on dApps and stablecoins. While they might protect consumers and instill confidence in using crypto services, do these regulations always serve the interests of decentralized applications?

Stablecoins benefit from comprehensive regulations that address risks, providing clarity on reserve management and financial stability. The U.S. GENIUS Act, for example, establishes a legal framework that enhances the credibility of stablecoins.

For dApps, clear guidelines mitigate uncertainty, allowing developers to innovate unhindered. Although regulations often enhance user confidence, they may inadvertently stifle truly decentralized models, especially DAOs, which may face regulatory hurdles.

Ultimately, robust regulatory frameworks are vital for the success of dApps and stablecoins, lessening risks while promoting innovation.

Fintech startups are in a prime position to benefit from the growing trend of utility-driven blockchain applications. So how can they make the most of this?

Smart Contracts can automate mundane tasks related to loan approvals and payments, minimizing overhead and inefficiencies.

Payment Processing enhancements allow for real-time, secure transactions without intermediaries.

Security and Fraud Reduction come from the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain.

Identity Verification processes can be streamlined, simplifying regulatory requirements and customer onboarding.

Tokenizing Assets opens new avenues for investment and fundraising.

DeFi offers pathways to enter peer-to-peer lending and trading ecosystems.

By embracing these utilities, fintech startups can enhance their operational efficiency and capitalize on emerging business models.

The landscape for payroll and payments within the crypto sector is evolving rapidly. Decentralized applications are at the forefront of this transformation. 

Crypto payroll solutions are increasingly common among startups, which cater to a tech-savvy workforce. Remote startups and freelancers often favor salaries in cryptocurrencies.

Stablecoins are also gaining traction for payroll due to their relative price stability, especially for businesses that want to avoid digital currency volatility.

B2B crypto payment platforms are being utilized, which streamline various processes and lower transactional costs.

Regulatory compliance is becoming paramount, as businesses must navigate tax laws and labor regulations while offering crypto payments.

Finally, the decentralized nature of blockchain facilitates global payments across borders without intermediaries, simplifying international payroll.

To summarize, with decentralized applications and blockchain technology increasingly integrated into payroll systems, the financial landscape is undoubtedly changing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Based Eggman Gains Attention Among Emerging Crypto Projects, Challenging Presale Rivals Blockchain FX","https://www.tribuneindia.com/partner-exclusives/based-eggman-gains-attention-among-emerging-crypto-projects-challenging-presale-rivals-blockchain-fx/","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 09:29:00 GMT","

The 2025 crypto renaissance has ignited unprecedented interest in presale investments, where visionary projects offer life-changing wealth potential before mainstream exposure. Among the contenders capturing investor attention, Based Eggman ($GGs) has rapidly outpaced its most vocal competitor Blockchain FX ($BFX), establishing itself as the definitive best crypto presale for those seeking exponential growth. While Blockchain FX positions itself as a multi-asset trading infrastructure play, its conventional approach fails to harness the cultural momentum that historically transforms presales into generational opportunities—a phenomenon where Based Eggman's meticulously engineered tokenomics, community-driven utility, and meme-powered ecosystem shine with undeniable superiority.



Based Eggman Rises As Most Popular Crypto Presale



Based Eggman Presale masterfully replicates the DNA of crypto's most transformative early investments. With a surgically precise supply cap of 389,152,000 tokens, it creates artificial scarcity that mirrors Solana's 2018 seed round where early backers secured tokens at $0.005 before the network's gaming boom. Unlike Blockchain FX's passive redistribution model, Based Eggman embeds deflation directly into its ecosystem: every NFT trade on its marketplace, every in-game transaction, and every social competition triggers automatic token burns—creating a self-reinforcing cycle where increased adoption directly reduces supply. This mirrors Axie Infinity's presale blueprint where $AXS token value surged 1,200% in six months because gameplay mechanics inherently destroyed tokens faster than new issuance. Most critically, Based Eggman launches with fully operational utility: players can immediately deploy $GGs in its Eggman-themed strategy game, compete in streaming tournaments with real token rewards, and trade character NFTs—all while Blockchain FX remains confined to whitepaper promises.



BlockchainFX Presale Faces New Competitor

Blockchain FX Presale vs Based Eggman Presale represents the clash between traditional finance thinking and crypto's disruptive essence. Blockchain FX's roadmap requires navigating complex regulatory minefields across multiple asset classes—a process that historically delays value realization by 18-24 months. Based Eggman leverages Base Blockchain's Coinbase integration for instant mainstream accessibility, bypassing regulatory hurdles while tapping into 100 million potential users. While Blockchain FX targets professional traders with complex financial instruments, Based Eggman speaks the universal language of memes and gaming—engaging the demographic that fueled Bitcoin's 2017 surge and Ethereum's 2020 explosion. Critically, Blockchain FX's large supply model faces relentless sell pressure from institutional unlocks, whereas Based Eggman's 60% presale allocation to retail investors creates a loyal community that actively defends the token through ecosystem participation rather than passive holding.



Conclusion: Based Eggman vs BlockchainFX Presale

For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, the evidence is unequivocal. Based Eggman Presale replicates the exact conditions that generated generational wealth in prior cycles: finite supply creating artificial scarcity, deflationary mechanics tied to real-world usage, cultural magnetism for viral growth, and immediate utility that rewards early adopters. Where Blockchain FX Presale offers a promising but conventional infrastructure play, Based Eggman delivers the emotional resonance and economic design that historically turns $500 investments into life-changing sums within months.

NFT communities blur the line between fandom and faith. This in-depth look explores how memes, rituals, and loyalty shape web3 culture - and why it feels a lot like modern-day cult behavior.

Eliza Crichton-Stuart

NFTs have always been about more than digital art. They've built entire cultures around shared language, inside jokes, and intense loyalty. As reported by Wolves DAO, as those communities have grown, some observers can't help but notice the similarities between NFT fandom and cult-like devotion. Whether it's the repetitive chants, the worship of founders, or the sense of belonging that keeps people hooked, web3 seems to have turned meme culture into a belief system.

Every major crypto or NFT movement has relied on memes to spread its message. Bitcoin didn't gain global traction because millions studied the whitepaper - it went viral through catchphrases like “HODL” and “magic internet money.” Those phrases turned complex ideas into digestible, shareable symbols.

That pattern continued with every generation of web3 projects. Ripple had the “XRP Army,” CryptoPunks became status symbols long before NFTs hit the mainstream, and Axie Infinity built a play-to-earn movement that reached entire communities in the Philippines. The story was never just about technology - it was about identity.

On the Alpha Wolves podcast, early adopter Seed Phrase explained that every crypto wave follows the same cycle: a simple idea becomes a story, the story becomes a meme, and the meme becomes a movement. In other words, memes aren't just entertainment - they're the language of belief in web3.

Spend enough time in an NFT Discord server or X Space, and the pattern becomes clear. Certain phrases act like mantras - “WAGMI” (We're All Gonna Make It) and “diamond hands” being two of the most common. Floor sweeps are celebrated like collective victories, while project collapses are mourned with a flood of “F” reactions in chat.

Even the structure of these communities resembles organized groups. Discord roles create hierarchies, weekly Spaces function like recurring gatherings, and members often treat participation as a form of loyalty. What might look like a chatroom from the outside can feel more like a digital clubhouse or, depending on perspective, a place of worship.

This structure works because it taps into something deeply human: the need to belong. The shared rituals and inside jokes build a sense of identity that extends beyond owning a token. For many, being part of a community feels more rewarding than the investment itself.

Not all of this energy is negative. Corey Wright, founder of Honeyland, has spoken about how NFT projects can create genuine connection. In his community, players aren't just chasing rewards - they're collaborating, sharing experiences, and forming friendships that extend beyond the game.

Many people in web3 echo that sentiment. The late-night voice chats, meme raids, and project collaborations build real bonds. These are the same communities that turn strangers into teammates and investors into creators. In that sense, the “cult energy” can be seen as collective passion - a mix of creativity, optimism, and shared purpose.

But passion can quickly turn into pressure. When enthusiasm becomes loyalty, criticism can feel like betrayal. It's not uncommon for members to be labeled as “FUDders” (spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt) for raising concerns about sustainability or leadership.

Crypto commentator Crypto Gorilla has pointed out that hype often drives NFT markets more than fundamentals. Strong community engagement can boost prices and visibility, even when projects lack long-term plans. This creates what some call “Kool-Aid economics” - a belief system where faith in the project outweighs rational analysis.

When markets crash, the same communities that once preached unity can turn against founders, influencers, or each other. The line between fandom and fanaticism becomes increasingly thin.

Every movement has its figureheads. In web3, these are the founders, influencers, and meme accounts that become symbols of entire communities.

Seed Phrase represents endurance in the NFT space, embodying the “diamond hands” mentality. His reputation, real or exaggerated, has turned him into a cultural reference point. On the other end of the spectrum, Corey Wright represents the grounded, community-focused founder archetype - someone who connects with the audience on a personal level.

These leaders often shape the narrative. They become the faces that humanize projects, transforming abstract technologies into relatable stories. Whether intentionally or not, they're the prophets of meme culture - keeping belief alive when logic alone wouldn't.

The question isn't whether NFT communities are cults - it's whether that comparison actually matters. The loyalty, rituals, and storytelling that define these groups are also what give them staying power. Without that level of engagement, most NFT projects would fade during market downturns.

Still, unchecked devotion can create echo chambers where accountability disappears. The future of NFT communities may depend on finding balance: encouraging passion without silencing dissent, building culture without breeding conformity.

At their best, these communities transform speculation into shared creativity. At their worst, they replace critical thinking with blind faith. The line between the two might define the next era of web3.

What makes NFT communities similar to cults?NFT communities often develop shared language, rituals, and loyalty that resemble cult-like behavior. Members rally around leaders, adopt group symbols, and form strong emotional attachments to their projects.

Are NFT communities harmful?Not necessarily. Many communities foster creativity, collaboration, and connection. The issue arises when loyalty overrides critical thinking, leading members to ignore risks or red flags.

Why do memes play such a big role in NFT culture?Memes simplify complex ideas and make them shareable. In web3, they serve as both communication tools and cultural symbols, helping spread ideas quickly across digital spaces.

Who are notable figures mentioned in NFT community culture?Seed Phrase is often referenced as a symbol of endurance and “diamond hands,” while Corey Wright is known for building positive, community-driven environments like Honeyland.

Can NFT culture exist without community hype?Probably not. Community engagement and storytelling are key to sustaining interest and value in NFT projects. Without them, the space risks losing its cultural momentum.

Kite (KITE) functions as an AI-driven blockchain solution for payments. It expertly develops infrastructure to connect artificial intelligence processing with the immediate execution of transactions on-chain, thereby boosting transaction speed and user accessibility.

Source: gokite.ai

Within the quickly expanding domain of automated digital settlements, Kite addresses the crucial requirement for rapid and intelligent transaction pathfinding. It unlocks new prospects for commercial adoption by delivering protocols that ensure settlement in real time.

The project primarily seeks to enable a new class of payment strategies. It accomplishes this by supplying infrastructure for executing transfers immediately and subsequently deploying these transfers within the decentralized environment. As a result, this greatly enhances capital efficiency and the utility of cross-market transactions.

Fundamentally, Kite confronts two primary issues in the current blockchain space: one is the inherent delays in transaction confirmation. The other one is the rising demand for adaptive routing mechanisms guided by intelligence.

To effectively resolve these obstacles, Kite deploys a framework that blends on-chain finality with computations derived from off-chain AI models. Its central function involves a distributed network that oversees the intelligent routing process. These components guarantee transaction speed and verifiability.

Furthermore, Kite builds the essential transaction layer for the emerging “Agentic Internet,” offering unified identity, payment, and governance infrastructure specifically for autonomous AI agents. It natively incorporates standards that allow these agents to send, receive, and reconcile payments through standardized intent instructions, positioning itself as the primary execution and settlement layer for these systems.

KITE serves as the native asset that powers the entire Kite ecosystem. The token possesses approximately three primary uses: rewarding network participants who supply data and processing power, securing the AI-payment verification process through staking functions, and supporting the platform's ongoing development.

Specifically, KITE holders directly contribute to verifying the integrity of the network's intelligence layer. In other words, they actively participate in confirming the soundness of the AI-determined routing choices. Holders stake KITE to secure the network, which subsequently yields returns based on their contribution to transaction volume.

KITE's total token supply is 10,000,000,000. The Initial Circulating Supply at Binance listing stands at 1,800,000,000 KITE (approximately 18.00% of the total supply).

Cryptocurrency is no longer just a curiosity. Despite warnings from financial experts and law enforcement agencies about volatility, scams, and lax regulatory oversight, digital currencies are now part of the financial mainstream.

Major investment firms and banks now offer Bitcoin funds; payment giants like PayPal and Mastercard offer ways to buy, spend, or store digital currencies. With Venmo, you can buy, sell, or transfer cryptocurrencies the same way you can split a lunch bill. And a growing number of businesses now accept crypto as payment.

A recent survey of cryptocurrency holders by the National Cryptocurrency Association found that most respondents (76 percent) said they trust crypto as much or more than traditional banks. But a February 2024 Pew Research Center survey found most Americans “aren't confident in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrency.” In the Pew survey, 63 percent of respondents said they had “little to no confidence that current ways to invest in, trade, or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe.”

The crypto craze is powered by the potential for enormous riches. When the first exchange opened in 2010, a single Bitcoin was valued at about $0.03. Today, it's worth about $110,000. 

While this modern-day gold rush has made people (mostly insiders) incredibly rich, many others have lost money. 

“Crypto isn't really an investment,” said Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, who compares buying crypto to betting on an NFL football game. There are no underlying investments or governments backing most crypto, Frayer warns.

Frayer, who previously worked as a senior advisor at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), cautions that digital currencies are “created out of thin air,” and their value depends largely on the “public fervor about the technology itself.”

Unlike publicly traded companies, which must provide regular and verifiable financial disclosures, most crypto companies offer little transparency.

Crypto is also far more volatile than most stocks, bonds, and commodities. Daily price swings of two to four percent are typical. “Exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns, and macroeconomic conditions” can trigger sudden crashes, according to Webopedia.

“Outside actors” with significant positions in a digital currency have already used “subterfuge techniques,” including fake news releases from major retailers and the SEC to influence crypto prices, said Amanda Fischer, COO of Better Markets, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in the financial markets. 

Fischer, who previously served as chief of staff at the SEC, worries about the lack of market surveillance that's required for other investments. And while it may seem less risky to buy exchange-traded crypto funds (ETFs) through a bank or brokerage firm, the underlying crypto assets remain unregulated, she warns.

Her advice: “Treat any cryptocurrency investment like you would any sort of budget for sports betting or gambling; only put up what you can afford to lose.”

Fisher and Frayer were guests on a recent episode of Checkbook's Consumerpedia podcast. 

Another concern about crypto is accessibility. It's estimated that up to 20 percent of all mined coins are permanently inaccessible due to dormant wallets, forgotten passwords, or lost private keys. As the website CCN noted, ”Access to Bitcoin is binary; either the private key works or it doesn't. If the private key is lost, the funds cannot be moved. There are no shortcuts, resets, or overrides.”

Anything digital can be hacked—including cryptocurrency stored in your digital wallet or with a third-party company. Since 2014, at least 10 major crypto exchange hacks that stole more than $100 million each have been documented, according to Crystal Intelligence.

Earlier this year, hackers believed to be in North Korea stole $1.4 billion in Ethereum assets from Bybit, a Dubai-based crypto exchange. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, and this was the largest single crypto theft in the industry's history. Unlike bank accounts, Crypto exchange accounts are not insured.

“Part of what makes cryptocurrency such an attractive honeypot for hackers is not only the ease with which it can be stolen, but the ease with which it can be laundered once it is stolen,” Fischer said.

The hackers use online services called “mixers” or “tumblers,” that quickly launder digital currency by erasing its internet history, she explained. By the time the exchange or law enforcement learns about the heist, the money is gone forever.

President Donald Trump, who in 2021 told Fox News that Bitcoin “seems like a scam,” now promises to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world.”

In August, he signed an executive order that expanded investment options for employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plans to include cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate. The order directed the Department of Labor, the Treasury Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise their guidelines to allow these investment options.

Since employers are still fiduciaries, required to act in their employees' best interests when selecting retirement plan options, it remains to be seen how many are willing to take the risk of offering the crypto option.

Financial advisor Tom Cock, a partner at Apella Wealth and co-host of the Talking Real Money podcast, urges clients and listeners not to consider crypto as an investment.

“Adding cryptocurrency to your 401(k) puts your hard-earned money at the risk of high volatility, exposes it to a small and unproven asset, and could potentially lead to complete loss,” Cock told Checkbook. “If you are considering crypto, you might also look at Beanie Babies or tulip bulbs.”

The IRS treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, not currency. Transactions involving bitcoin are subject to capital gains tax, like stocks and real estate. Crypto holdings and transactions must be reported on your income tax form each year.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize volatility by pegging their value to a more stable asset, typically the U.S. dollar. You can already use stablecoins to buy tickets and concessions at AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas, or to purchase computer equipment from Newegg. Shopify now accepts crypto payments. 

“The major risk to holders of stablecoins is that the issuer may not be willing or able to fulfill redemption requests for their tokens at face value,” according to commentary posted on the Brookings Institution website. The authors noted that in May 2022, a selloff of the TerraUSD stablecoin “caused it to plummet in price, eliminating over $45 billion in value within a week.” 

Stablecoins got a boost in July when President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) into law, the first cryptocurrency legislation ever passed by Congress. It establishes federal rules and guidelines for companies offering stablecoins, including the requirement that they maintain 100 percent reserve backing with “liquid assets,” such as U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries.

Critics of the GENIUS Act, including the nonprofit vericans for Financial Reform, claim it will dismantle federal safeguards, create “windfalls for crypto tycoons,” and allow big tech companies to “further entrench their monopoly power.”

Mainstream financial players are racing to expand their crypto offerings. PayPal customers in the U.S. can now buy, sell, hold, and transfer select cryptocurrencies directly within their PayPal and Venmo accounts. PayPal also offers its own stablecoin, PayPal USD. 

Mastercard recently announced that its cardholders can use stablecoins to make purchases at more than 150 million merchants worldwide. The company said it is “expanding” how more than 3.5 billion Mastercard cards in circulation can securely engage with crypto.”

Visa boasts on its website that it is working with “more than 70 of the leading crypto platforms” to issue crypto-linked cards that “make it simple and convenient to convert and spend crypto.”

Crypto has become the currency of choice for criminals running romance scams, investment schemes, and government or bank impersonation cons. Digital currency is perfect for criminals: virtually anonymous, and transactions are instantaneous and irreversible. 

Instead of telling their victims to buy gift cards at a local store (a still-common tactic), many fraudsters now direct them to nearby Bitcoin ATMs, where they can turn cash into crypto. There are about 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., according to the latest estimate from the website Coin ATM Radar, making them easy to find.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports that scams involving Bitcoin ATMS “have surged dramatically” in recent years. Tens of millions of dollars a year are now being converted to digital currency and sent to the fraudsters. The FTC calls these crypto ATMs “payment portals for scammers.”

“Our familiarity with traditional ATMs is a big reason why scammers are getting their victims to send money via cryptocurrency kiosks,” said John Breyault, who manages the National Consumers League's Fraud.org website. “Unfortunately for scam victims, once their cash goes into these devices, it's almost instantaneously turned into untraceable and unrecoverable cryptocurrency.”

If you've fallen for a crypto scam, contact the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). A law enforcement agency may not be able to recover your money, but your complaint could help investigators track down the perpetrators.

Oops, something went wrong

The cryptocurrency industry saw more than $19 billion in liquidations within 24 hours following President Donald Trump's new tariff announcement against China on Oct. 10. Bitcoin, which had touched new highs of $126,000 on Oct. 6, dropped to as low as $104,600 following Trump's announcement.

On Oct. 8, Hargreaves Lansdown, the biggest retail investing platform in the UK, issued a strong warning to its clients against trading cryptocurrencies, calling them risky and highly volatile. The warning came after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes for retail investors.

The financial services company with 1.5 million clients said at the time that Bitcoin is ""much riskier"" than stocks and bonds, and the digital currency has seen ""several periods of extreme losses.""

""We do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals,"" the company said.

Hargreaves Lansdown said that unlike other alternative asset classes, Bitcoin has ""no intrinsic value"" and it's impossible to analyze performance assumptions for the digital currency.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

However, it acknowledged that Bitcoin is the largest and most widely held digital currency and its long-term returns ""have been positive."" Despite this, the company believes Bitcoin is not an asset class.

Hargreaves Lansdown said in its statement that despite the risks, many people would ""wish to speculate"" with crypto ETNs after the UK lifted its ban on such products. The company said it would start allowing ""appropriate"" clients to trade in cryptocurrency ETNs in 2026, after conducting assessments to ensure they understand the risks involved.

Though the market remains volatile, financial firms are planning to launch crypto ETFs amid rising investor appetite for riskier assets. More than 100 ETF applications related to smaller cryptocurrencies are awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Bloomberg.  T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) recently filed for approval of an ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that would give investors exposure to several digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum and Dogecoin, among others.

UK backs £100 mln export credit support for Ciner Glass days after CEO's arrest in Turkey probe

Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder and chief executive officer of the collapsed Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, was found dead in his prison cell on Friday, according to Turkish media.

Authorities said Özer, 30, was discovered hanging in his room at the Tekirdağ F-Type High Security Prison in northwestern Turkey. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into his death. Official sources have not yet confirmed whether it was suicide or if foul play is suspected.

Özer had been serving one of the longest prison sentences ever handed down in Turkey. In September 2023, a court in İstanbul sentenced him to 11,196 years in prison for fraud, money laundering and leading a criminal organization. The court also fined him 135 million Turkish lira, equivalent to several million dollars.

Thodex was one of Turkey's largest cryptocurrency exchanges during the country's digital currency boom. It was founded by Özer in 2017, when Turkey's inflation-stricken economy drove many citizens to invest in crypto assets to protect their savings.

In April 2021 the platform abruptly stopped allowing users to withdraw their money. Özer claimed that Thodex had been targeted by a cyberattack and said the suspension was temporary. Instead, he boarded a flight from İstanbul to Albania and disappeared, leaving hundreds of thousands of investors unable to access their funds.

Turkish prosecutors later accused him of fleeing with about $2 billion in investors' assets, though the total losses were never officially confirmed. The sudden collapse of Thodex made global headlines and triggered a debate about the dangers of unregulated crypto markets in Turkey.

At Turkey's request INTERPOL issued a Red Notice for Özer shortly after his disappearance. He was arrested in August 2022 in the coastal town of Himarë, Albania, after more than a year on the run. Following a lengthy extradition process, he was returned to Turkey in April 2023 and detained upon arrival at İstanbul Airport.

At his trial prosecutors demanded over 40,000 years in prison, stacking multiple charges for each affected investor. The court convicted him on three main charges — forming and leading a criminal organization, aggravated fraud and money laundering — and sentenced him to more than 11,000 years. His brother and sister received identical sentences.

Opinion by: Louise Ivan, co-founder and CEO of Ryder

Step aside, maximalists. Crypto isn't the domain of early adopters and philosophically driven “hodlers” anymore. The demographics of crypto usage are shifting fast, with stablecoins, in particular, leading the charge.

Forget about newcomers stacking sats. In Q3 2025, Tether's USDt USDTUSD and Circle's USDC USDCUSD collectively accounted for approximately 40% of the total crypto volume. This gargantuan figure is due, in part, to folks from emerging regions like Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America wanting a better way to move their money.

Their reasons for diving into crypto are practical and straightforward. If crypto tech wants to meet them where they're at, its products must evolve to meet these changing needs.

The need for practicality drives adoption

Not so long ago, getting into crypto meant buying Bitcoin BTCUSD, maybe reading a white paper or two, and finding out — sometimes, the hard way — about seed phrases, personal wallets and the perils of self-custody.

Today, most people outside the crypto enthusiast circles aren't thinking about ideological freedom or permissionless money. They're thinking about needs. The drive for practicality is everywhere.

In 2025, retail-sized transfers below $250 increased in volume, showing growth in everyday, small-value payments (exactly the kind needed for groceries, bills or tuition at home). 

Stablecoins are dominating this pattern, becoming the first crypto asset many people encounter, especially in places where banks are slow, expensive or unreliable.

The Philippines ranks among the globe's biggest recipients of remittances. Citizens need to send money across borders cheaply, quickly and without banking hurdles. Stablecoins solve that problem.

Centralized exchanges and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms are now experiencing a surge in traffic from users who value cryptocurrency for its utility rather than ideological reasons. It's not just anecdotal: Chainalysis' 2025 Global Adoption Index shows that India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Brazil and the Philippines are leading in grassroots crypto activity, much of which is routed through non-volatile assets, like stablecoins.

According to the World Economic Forum, the average stablecoin transfer in emerging markets ranges from $100 to $500. Cross-border remittances make up a multibillion-dollar portion of the crypto ecosystem annually.

Crypto adoption among Filipinos, in particular, has increased to 22.5%, up from 17.8% last year, primarily driven by play-to-earn gaming and remittance needs. Other fast-growing markets, including Nigeria and Vietnam, are also experiencing similar trends. Practicality and necessity are driving people to crypto, rather than the prospect of freedom, money or other philosophical motivations.

New users need a new kind of security

There is, however, a tradeoff lurking in the wings. New users primarily care about utility — specifically, sending and receiving funds — and often skip deeper crypto fundamentals, such as private keys, seed phrases and self-custody. They're far more likely to rely on wallets provided by exchanges or custodians. While these solutions may be more straightforward and familiar, they run counter to the original ethos of crypto: not your keys, not your coins.

It's not just about ease of use; it's about risk and responsibility. The narrative of “lose your seed phrase, lose your crypto” is a nonstarter for someone wiring $60 for groceries. If self-custody means risking the loss of essential household funds due to a forgotten sequence of words, adoption slows and trust erodes.

For businesses and platforms, the lesson is clear: If most new users lack the desire or time to master seed phrases and backup protocols, crypto security needs to be built natively into the product, not bolted on as an afterthought.

Innovators are already on the case. Companies are experimenting with abstracting away seed phrases, using multi-layered account recovery, trusted contacts or even hardware integrations to safeguard assets without exposing users to the complexities of cryptocurrency's cryptography.

Security is evolving from a test of technical knowledge and mental tenacity to a transparent background feature.

Abstracting away complexity is key to the next wave of adoption

This new wave of crypto users isn't waiting for the perfect UX. They're already using stablecoins for real-world utility, whether they realize the blockchain rails are underneath them or not. Many Filipinos are already engaging in P2P cash exchanges to convert their digital assets back into fiat currency.

Crypto's convenience and speed are embedded in the daily lives of millions, enabling them to send money, make purchases on Facebook Marketplace, settle family bills and manage side hustles in gaming economies.​

Crypto technology's next big win won't be about championing ideological arguments; it will be about quietly powering global money movement and commerce, native in everyday apps, as frictionless as sending a WhatsApp message.

Some of the world's largest businesses, from remittance processors to mobile money providers, are integrating blockchain rails, creating experiences where users never see a wallet address or a blockchain explorer but instead enjoy faster settlement and lower fees.​

Built-in security is a must

What does this mean for teams building crypto solutions? Firstly, products must make security seamless and not a burden for the user to bear. Custodial wallets, social recovery, multifactor authentication and even regulated, insured custody options are all part of the toolkit. If cryptocurrency aspires to mainstream adoption and financial inclusion, it must recognize the needs and risk tolerance of its users. It must deliver best-in-class UX, clear safeguards and effective recovery options.

Secondly, it means welcoming a new global crypto population: not just the cypherpunks and maximalists, but people who rely on utility, trust and practical empowerment. The cryptocurrency industry is poised for a much broader transformation. Blockchain is the rails, but onboarding is effortless, security is built-in, and mass adoption doesn't require everyone to be their own bank.

With USDT and USDC now accounting for 40% of global crypto trading volume, and more than 161 million people holding stablecoins, the asset class is larger than the population of the world's 10 biggest cities combined.

The fastest-growing crypto economies aren't coming for philosophy. They want solvency, convenience and freedom from legacy banking.​ 

Crypto's future depends on recognizing the changing face of adoption. We must build technologies that serve this new reality.

Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., operator of the social media platform Truth Social, the streaming platform Truth+, and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, announced Tuesday that it will make prediction markets available on Truth Social through an exclusive arrangement with Crypto.com | Derivatives North America (CDNA), a CFTC-registered exchange and clearinghouse that under Singapore-based cryptocurrency firm Crypto.com. 

Following the integration, Truth Social will be the first social media platform to offer its users technology to access embedded prediction markets capabilities through CDNA, Crypto.com said in a statement. 

According to the statement, Truth Social users will be able to trade prediction contracts related to major events and milestones, such as political elections, interest and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil, events across all major sports leagues, and more using the new product technology called “Truth Predict”. 

Prices will update in real-time, allowing users to react instantly to developments in major current events.

“We are thrilled to become the world's first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets, 

“Truth Predict will allow our loyal users to engage in prediction markets with a trusted network while harnessing our social media platform to provide totally unique ways for users to discuss and compare their predictions,” said Devin Nunes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Trump Media.

With more than $3 billion in financial assets as of the end of the second quarter, and having posted its first quarter of positive operating cash flow after going public just last year, he said Trump Media is well-positioned to leverage its strong balance sheet and existing social media capabilities to create a new standard for access to prediction market platforms. 

“For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets – with Truth Predict, we're democratizing information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight,” he added. 

It is noted that the event contracts will be offered via CDNA, with the integration providing a federally compliant way to access CDNA event contracts and make predictions on the outcomes of events, including politics, economics, financials, and sports – all seamlessly woven with technology from Truth Social.

“Prediction markets are poised to be a multi-deca-billion dollar industry, 

“Crypto.com has quickly become one of the most trusted providers of prediction market services, and we're thrilled to combine with Truth Social to support the world's first prediction markets available from a social media platform. This aligns perfectly with what users look for in social media – a community to engage with and seek truth,” said Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crypto.com. 

He noted Truth Predict will provide customers with a powerful tool related to market sentiment on an unlimited number of events. 

“We are thrilled to integrate Truth Social's truly pioneering social media platform and technology with our industry-leading technology and regulated prediction market trading,” he added. 

According to the statement, the integration will begin Beta testing live on Truth Social in the near future, followed by a full launch in the United States. 

Subsequently, Trump Media plans to launch the service globally once all the requisite requirements are met.

Truth Social and Truth+ users who have Truth gems, which are earned for interacting on the platforms, will be able to convert their gems into the Cronos (CRO) digital currency and apply them to purchases of Truth Predict contracts.

This initiative between Trump Media and Crypto.com follows the recent establishment of a strategic partnership between the firms to introduce a CRO rewards system on the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms, as well as the announcement to establish Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, Inc., following a definitive agreement for a proposed business combination with Yorkville Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by Yorkville Acquisition Sponsor LLC, to form a digital asset treasury company focused on the acquisition of CRO.

Elon Musk has officially unveiled X Chat, a new encrypted messaging feature for X to rival Telegram and WhatsApp, with a rollout expected within the next few months. 

Announcing the launch during The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which aired on Friday. Musk said the entire messaging stack had been rebuilt from scratch. 

“On X, we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack into what's called ‘X Chat,” said Musk

According to Musk, it utilizes peer-to-peer encryption technology, similar to that used by Bitcoin. For now, it is being evaluated to establish if it is ready for deployment.

Musk said he believes the new messaging app will be available in a “few months,” and that it will not have any “hooks for advertising,” citing competitors such as WhatsApp, which “knows enough about what you're texting to know what ads to show you,” he said.

He cautioned that this poses a tremendous security threat, as having enough material to display targeted advertisements indicates that they possess a massive amount of confidential information, including users' private messages, that hackers could use to gain access. 

Meta, WhatsApp's parent company, maintains it does not have access to private conversations, stating in its FAQ that messages between people are end-to-end encrypted with the Signal Protocol. This also includes voicemails, media, and documents. 

However, many believe that “metadata,” such as who you contacted and how frequently you spoke with them, is not encrypted. WhatsApp does not automatically encrypt backups of your chat history. 

WhatsApp's FAQ section on “Does WhatsApp collect or sell your data?” does not address the latter portion of the issue, instead stating that “we work with other Meta companies to help provide, improve, and support each other's services.”

The company also notes that users who integrate WhatsApp with other Meta products consent to some data sharing between platforms.

Musk aims to be different and stated that X Chat will avoid such advertising “hooks.” He notes that his main goal is to create a fully encrypted system capable of sending messages, files, and conducting audio or video calls. 

According to Musk, it will be “the least insecure of any messaging system.” The new service will be integrated into the X platform and also released as a standalone app.

Separately, on Monday, Musk introduced Grokipedia, his version of Wikipedia powered by his AI company, xAI. The crowdsourced encyclopedia, which Musk says will “purge out the propaganda” found on Wikipedia, briefly crashed after launch but already featured more than 800,000 AI-generated entries, compared to Wikipedia's nearly eight million human-written articles.

Visitors to the website, grokipedia.com, were welcomed with a bare-bones logo and a search bar that enabled them to query topics.

One entry on Musk himself describes him as “a blend of innovative visionary with irreverent provocateur”. It continues to showcase details of his diet, noting his consumption of “occasional indulgences like morning donuts and multiple Diet Cokes daily.” 

Grokipedia also has entries on OpenAI, a competitor of xAI, as well as political figures such as President Trump and the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.

The new site expands the billionaire's online media ecosystem, which closely aligns with his personal political views. Still, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales wasn't keen on Grokipedia.  Speaking at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York, Jimmy noted he did not need to study Grokipedia's content to predict how it would turn out.“I'm not optimistic he will create anything very useful right now,” he said. Jimmy stressed he was not worried about competition.

According to the executive, his lack of interest in reviewing Grokipedia is not a personal matter. He continues to state that the core problem is the technology behind it. He said the large language models Musk is using turn out to be big blunders.

On X, Mr. Musk has reinstated right-wing creators and expanded their reach to many audiences, utilizing the platform as a bully pulpit to advocate for government funding cuts. He has also tweaked xAI's chatbot, Grok, to a more conservative tone.

According to Ryan McGrady, a senior research fellow at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies encyclopedias and social media platforms, the impulse to control knowledge is as old as knowledge itself. He continues to say that controlling what gets written is a way to gain or keep power.

Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk says X will ship a standalone “X Chat” in the coming months while keeping Chat embedded in X, adding that its peer-to-peer encryption approach is “similar to Bitcoin” and that the system avoids advertising hooks.

Speaking on Friday's “Joe Rogan Experience,” Musk said X has “rebuilt the entire messaging stack” as X Chat and argued security should be viewed in “degrees of insecurity,” not as a binary. He described a peer-to-peer-style model and said the goal is to make Chat “the least insecure” among messaging apps. He added that encryption is “very good” and undergoing thorough testing.

Musk linked his security pitch to business design. He said rival messengers introduce risk when they include “hooks for advertising,” arguing that any pathway used to target ads could become an avenue to read messages if abused. He said X Chat will not include such hooks.

Distribution will be dual track. “We'll have both,” Musk said, noting a dedicated app targeted “in a few months,” alongside the integrated experience inside X. In either version, users should be able to text, share files, and place audio or video calls once the full feature set lands.

The current status is more modest. Inside X today, Chat functions as an upgraded replacement for legacy direct messages and is in beta for Premium subscribers. The in-app Chat supports text, photos, media attachments, GIFs, and file sharing tied to X handles rather than phone numbers. Audio and video calling were cited by Musk as part of the plan but do not appear in the current version of X.

Musk's framing centers on two ideas: keep content encrypted end to end and limit what the service must know by stripping out ad-targeting logic. Mainstream messengers often encrypt message content but retain metadata such as counterparties and timestamps; his view is that reducing reliance on advertising narrows the attack surface.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent marked the 17th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper on Friday with a post on X praising the network's resilience and adding a jab at Senate Democrats, saying the system “never shuts down” and implying lawmakers could “learn something from that.” The comment doubled as a policy signal and a partisan elbow.

Oct. 31 carries special weight in crypto. It is the date Satoshi Nakamoto released the nine-page Bitcoin white paper in 2008, the document that sketched a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and set the stage for a network that has run continuously since January 2009. Supporters use the anniversary to highlight bitcoin's always-on design and its independence from any single operator.

Bessent's note slots into a year of crypto-forward messaging from Treasury. 

In July, following President Trump's signature on the GENIUS Act, Bessent called stablecoins “a revolution in digital finance” and argued that an internet-native dollar rail could reinforce reserve-currency status while expanding access to dollar payments. Treasury published that statement on its website. 

In August, Bessent said on X that bitcoin forfeited to the U.S. would seed a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and that Treasury would explore budget-neutral ways to add more, signaling interest in building holdings without new appropriations. 

Reaction to Friday's post exposed familiar rifts inside crypto. 

Long-time Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr pushed back, saying bitcoin is “weaker than ever,” a nod to disputes over recent software releases and what they mean for network purity. 

Researcher Eric Wall replied with sarcasm that “bitcoin died after the core v30 release,” poking at recurrent doom takes after upgrades. 

Investor Simon Dixon reframed Bessent's line as a critique of currency policy, arguing that bitcoin's point is protection from political debasement. 

Others pressed for policy action: trader Fred Krueger quipped that Treasury should buy for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and digital-asset strategist Gabor Gurbacs urged putting bitcoin “on the balance sheet.” 

The replies split roughly into two camps — technical purists contesting blanket claims of resilience, and market participants pressing Treasury to turn rhetoric into acquisition policy.

The political edge was sharpened by timing. The federal government has been in a partial shutdown since Oct. 1 after Congress missed fiscal 2026 appropriations, resulting in roughly 900,000 furloughs, about 2 million employees working without pay, and curtailed operations at agencies including the NIH and CDC. The episode is the 11th shutdown to curtail services and is described as the longest full shutdown on record. 

Read narrowly, Bessent's post saluted a network that runs on weekends and holidays. Read politically, it contrasted bitcoin's uptime with a Congress stuck on funding bills — another sign that the Treasury chief intends to keep digital assets in the policy conversation on Washington's busiest days.

How Childhood Relationships Affect Your Adult Attachment Style, according to Large New Study

A large new study reveals how early relationships with parents and friends influence how we relate to those closest to us in adulthood

We come into the world screaming and vulnerable—entirely dependent on adult caregivers to keep us safe and teach us how to connect with others. The nature of these earliest relationships influences how we behave towards others and see the world long after we've grown—but in more complex and nuanced ways than researchers previously thought, according to the results of a large, decades-long study examining how the quality of children's interactions with parents and close peers went on to influence their relationships in adulthood.

In particular, early dynamics with mothers predicted future attachment styles for all the primary relationships in participants' lives, including with their parents, best friends and romantic partners, the study found. “People who felt closer to their mothers and had less conflict with their mothers in childhood tended to feel more secure in all of their relationships in adulthood,” says Keely Dugan, an assistant professor of social personality psychology at the University of Missouri and lead author of the study, which was published in October in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “That's a really striking finding because it demonstrates the enduring impact of that first person who is supposed to be there for you.”

Early childhood friends also played a strong role in predicting how participants approached their future close friendships—and their romantic connections. “When you have those first friendships at school, that's when you practice give-and-take dynamics,” Dugan says. “Relationships in adulthood then mirror those dynamics.”

The idea that earliest relationships have an outsized impact on our lives was popularized in psychology by Sigmund Freud. British psychiatrist John Bowlby later incorporated some core Freudian elements to create attachment theory, which helps explain variations in how people approach close relationships. “Some people are quite comfortable depending on others, opening up to them and using them as a secure base, whereas other people lack that confidence and trust,” says the new study's co-author R. Chris Fraley, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Researchers today define attachment styles by where people fall along two dimensions, each shaped by early experiences with caregivers. The first, attachment anxiety, measures your level of confidence in the availability and responsiveness of those you are close to. People high in attachment anxiety might have more intense fears of abandonment or need for reassurance. The second factor, attachment avoidance, involves how comfortable you feel opening up to others and depending on them for support. Those high in avoidance may believe that people cannot be counted on or trusted, so they avoid asking for help or emotional support—even if they need it. A relationship with high attachment anxiety, avoidance or both is defined as more insecure, while a relationship that is low in both attachment anxiety and avoidance is considered to be secure: “You feel comfortable and close to the other person, you trust them to be there for you, and you feel supported,” Dugan says.

It can be difficult to study exactly how early relationships go on to influence attachment style, though, because people's retrospective reports of what happened to them in childhood are skewed by memory failings and emotional and cognitive biases, Dugan notes. Of the relatively few studies that have examined associations between early caregiving experiences and adult attachment styles, she adds, all have focused almost exclusively on a single early relationship: the maternal one.

To more deeply understand how early relationships with a wider variety of people impact attachment styles, Dugan, Fraley and their colleagues turned to a landmark longitudinal study of 1,364 children and their families from around the U.S. It began when the children were infants and ended when they were 15 years old. Once the young participants were old enough to speak, they were surveyed about the quality of their relationships with their fathers, mothers and best friends. Researchers also surveyed participants' primary caregivers—who were mostly their mothers—and observed them interacting with their children. That study showed robust evidence that early experiences with caregivers matter for social development.

Between 2018 and 2022, 705 of the original participants, who by then were 26 to 31 years old, agreed to a follow-up study to collect information about their current relationships with their parents, best friends and romantic partners. For those 705 participants, Dugan and her colleagues analyzed associations between the quality of early relationships and later attachment styles in adulthood. They found several notable patterns. First, a person's relationship with their mother tended to set the stage for their later attachment style in general, as well as for their specific approaches to individual relationships with friends, romantic partners and fathers. For instance, people who had more conflict with their mothers, were less close to their mothers or had mothers who were reportedly harsher and showed less warmth during childhood and adolescence tended to feel more insecure in their adult relationships.

The researchers didn't find many associations between participants' relationships with their fathers and their future attachment styles—perhaps because most identified their mother as their primary caregiver. “This cohort's first assessment was in 1991, and even though the burden of caregiving still heavily falls on mothers, fathers were even less involved back then, on average,” Dugan says. “In cases where a father was the primary caregiver, the results might be flipped—but we don't have that data.”

Early experiences with close friends, though, were an even stronger predicter than maternal relationships for determining participants' approach to—specifically—romantic relationships and friendships in adulthood. “In general, if you had high-quality friendships and felt connected to your friends in childhood, then you felt more secure in romantic relationships and friendships at age 30,” Dugan says. People who enjoyed increasingly close and deepening friendships across childhood and adolescence also showed significant gains in those departments as adults, she adds.

The study's decades-spanning data are “uniquely valuable” and allowed the authors “to show, using sophisticated analyses, how early social experiences affect later adult personality and close interpersonal relationships,” says Phillip Shaver, a distinguished professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis.

Omri Gillath, a social psychologist at the University of Kansas, describes the new study as “exceptionally rigorous and methodologically sound.” The authors “provide some of the strongest prospective evidence to date supporting a foundational assumption of attachment theory: that early relational experiences shape how adults relate to others”—not just in general but also within specific types of relationships, he says.

The participants were still in early adulthood in the most recent analysis, Gillath adds, so future work could examine whether the same early-life factors continue to be so influential throughout life—and how major life transitions, such as parenthood, bereavement or divorce, might reshape those dynamics. Single-parent families, multigenerational households and same-sex couples should also be studied in future research, Dugan says. Participants in the current study were nearly 80 percent white, so more racial and ethnic diversity is needed to get a truly representative sample, she adds.

Dugan also emphasizes that the findings do not mean the past inexorably dictates the tone of a person's relationships in adulthood. “You're definitely not doomed,” she says. Evidence supports that adult attachment styles can change in response to later life events and can even fluctuate month to month in response to both positive and negative relationship experiences. “These findings show attachment styles are malleable,” Dugan says. “You can have a not-so-great relationship with your parents and still develop a secure and healthy bond with a close friend or romantic partner in adulthood.”

To that end, Dugan and her colleagues are building a research-based interactive app for promoting secure attachments in both romantic relationships and adult friendships. “It starts with easy first tasks, like hugging a partner or sending an encouraging text to a friend, and then works up from there,” she says. “There's always an opportunity to change your attachment style, and I'm excited about finding the most effective practical, concrete strategies for doing that.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Discovered Ancient DNA That Could Change Prehistory Forever","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69219933/ancient-dna-change-prehistory/","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

The genetic link between bones discovered thousands of miles away from each other suggests a prehistoric migration route.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Hidden in a dry canyon deep within the Crimean Mountains is the Paleolithic site of Starosele Cave. Archaeologists who recently excavated the site sifted through animal bones, eventually finding a fragment that belonged to a Neanderthal who lived 40-50,000 years ago. What they didn't know was that this individual's relatives had been found as far as the eastern extremes of Siberia.

Starosele Cave is known for the human remains that have surfaced since its discovery in the early 1950s. Until now, they had all turned out to be medieval or post-medieval. There was even the famous “Starosele child,” which was thought to represent the transition between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, until later analysis showed that this too was a medieval burial. While remains of Neanderthals on the verge of extinction have been found in the region, which appeared to be a refuge for these hominins, DNA could not be extracted from them. 

Now, ancient DNA from the Neanderthal bone fragment known as Star 1 is revealing how they migrated.

Late Neanderthal and early modern human remains are rarely unearthed in Eurasia. Even animal remains from Paleolithic sites are difficult to identify after being gnawed by carnivores, worn down by erosion and taphonomic processes, and moved around by humans. Evolutionary anthropologist Emily Pigott, of the University of Vienna, and her team used Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) to determine the genus and species of bone specimens. This minimally destructive technique separated the Neanderthal bone fragment, most likely a humerus or femur, from the bones of ancient fauna.

“Genetically, Star 1 is closely related to Neanderthals from the Altai via its mitochondrial DNA, suggesting long-range migrations of Neanderthal groups across Eurasia,” Pigott said in a study recently published in PNAS. “These migrations during favorable climatic conditions likely involved the spread of the Micoquian lithic tradition, indicating both cultural continuity and regional mobility during the Late Pleistocene.”

Whoever this individual was, radiocarbon dating of Star 1 revealed that they lived during the Crimean Micoquian technological period, during which stone was hammered thin and retouched on both sides to produce bifacial tools and weapons. When mitochondrial DNA, which resides in the mitochondria of the cell and is inherited from the maternal side, was analyzed, its origins were found to be far from local. This bone fragment was linked to others from three sites in the Altai mountains of Siberia. Denisova Cave, Chagyrskaya Cave, and Okladnikov Cave are located about 1,864 miles (3,000 km) northeast. 

Pigott and her team investigated further by building habitat suitability models that suggested the paleoclimate during interglacial periods, when vast ice sheets that had frozen over during ice ages melted, was most favorable for traveling. Chagyrskaya and Okladnikov are thought to have been seasonal hunting camps. The researchers figured out what could have been the route Neanderthals were most likely to use for trekking from the east of Siberia all the way to the Crimean peninsula, and these groups have more than genes in common.

Faunal bones that date to around the same time period, some of which still have knife marks, show that they hunted horses, bison and other animals that roamed the steppes where they lived. Stone tools excavated from Starosele also bear a remarkable likeness to those in Okladnikov and Chagyrskaya. Pigott's findings support previous studies that concluded Neanderthals must have spread over long distances, and that the Star 1 discovery could mean Crimea was at the crossroads of a path extending from what is now central Europe all the way to the edge of Siberia.

“It is likely that Neanderthals were in the Altai at two, perhaps even three, different periods,” she said. “Our results show that Starosele was part of a wide-ranging dispersal network of Neanderthals, linked by genes, lithics and behavior.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Japan's new “samurai jellyfish” is simply stunning","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251101000342.htm","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 08:32:11 GMT","

A team of student researchers at Tohoku University has identified a previously unknown species of the venomous Physalia (better known as the Portuguese man-of-war) in the waters of northeastern Japan. The finding points to how rising sea temperatures and altered ocean currents are affecting the range of marine species in the region.

Their work, published on October 30, 2025, in Frontiers in Marine Science (Marine Molecular Biology and Ecology), marks the first official description of a Physalia species native to Japan.

An Accidental Encounter

""I was working on a completely different research project around Sendai Bay in the Tohoku region, when I came across this unique jellyfish I had never seen around here before,"" recalls second author Yoshiki Ochiai. ""So I scooped it up, put it in a ziplock bag, hopped on my scooter, and brought it back to the lab!""

That unexpected encounter with the vibrant cobalt-blue creature led to the formal identification of a new species of Physalia. Professor Cheryl Ames of the Graduate School of Agricultural Science and the Advanced Institute for Marine Ecosystem Change (WPI-AIMEC) explained that the new species was named Physalia mikazuki (""crescent helmet man-o-war"") in honor of Sendai's feudal lord, Date Masamune, a samurai warrior whose iconic helmet featured a crescent moon.

Naming and Classifying the New Species

""It was a very involved process recording all the unique body structures that distinguish it from the other four species of Physalia,"" says first author Chanikarn Yongstar. ""I looked at each individual part, comparing its appearance to old tomes where scholars drew out the jellyfish anatomy by hand. A real challenge when you look at just how many tangled parts it has.""

In Japan, Physalia utriculus has long been known to inhabit waters from Okinawa to Sagami Bay. Scientists once assumed it was the only member of its genus in the region. However, DNA analysis comparing genetic sequences to global databases revealed that its range overlaps with the newly identified P. mikazuki. This means two species had been coexisting unnoticed until one appeared farther north in Tohoku.

Tracking the Journey Northward

""Our morphological and DNA analyses confirmed that these specimens represent a new species, distinct from its tropical relatives,"" explains researcher Kei Chloe Tan, who conducted the genetic testing. ""Which is an exciting finding in and of itself, but we still had questions about how it got here.""

This marks the first recorded sighting of a Physalia so far north in Japan. To uncover how it traveled such a distance, the team ran computer models simulating the movement of drifting organisms on ocean currents. The results indicated that warm water from the Kuroshio Current -- now extending farther north alongside unusually high sea-surface temperatures -- likely carried the colonies into Sendai Bay. These findings shed new light on how climate-driven ocean changes can alter the paths of floating marine life.

""I ran a particle simulation -- which is like dropping bright red beach balls in the water, then making data-based estimations to track where they will end up days or months later,"" explains Muhammad Izzat Nugraha. ""We were excited to find that in our simulation, all the beach balls essentially made a trail from Sagami Bay up to right where we found the 'crescent helmet man-o-war' in the Tohoku region.""

Beauty, Danger, and the Need for Awareness

The discovery underscores the importance of ongoing coastal monitoring and public education. With tentacles capable of stretching several meters and delivering intensely painful stings, tracking these organisms helps protect swimmers and beachgoers while also improving scientific understanding of marine ecosystems.

""These jellyfish are dangerous and perhaps a bit scary to some, but also beautiful creatures that are deserving of continued research and classification efforts,"" adds Ayane Totsu.

This study was supported by WPI-AIMEC (Advanced Institute for Marine Ecosystem Change) and made open access through funding from the APC Support Project for the Promotion of Open Access at Tohoku University in 2025.

Disrupting communication between the body's internal clock and the brain could help limit neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, according to new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WashU Medicine). The study, published in Nature Aging, explored how changes in the circadian system affect brain health and memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.

Led by Erik Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte & Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, and first author Jiyeon Lee, PhD, the research team investigated whether blocking a specific circadian clock protein might slow the progression of neurodegeneration. They found that inhibiting the activity of this protein lowered levels of tau, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer's pathology, and reduced damage to brain tissue.

REV-ERBα, NAD+, and Brain Aging

The circadian protein under investigation, called REV-ERBα, helps regulate the body's daily rhythms of metabolism and inflammation. While its role in the brain has been less understood, earlier studies in other tissues showed that REV-ERBα influences levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a molecule vital for metabolism, energy production, and DNA repair. Declining NAD+ levels are closely associated with brain aging and neurodegenerative conditions. Many over-the-counter supplements aim to raise NAD+ as a strategy to slow aging and promote cellular health.

To test REV-ERBα's role, the team genetically deleted the protein in two groups of mice: one in which the deletion occurred throughout the body, and another where it was removed only in astrocytes (supportive glial cells that form a major part of the central nervous system). In both cases, NAD+ levels rose significantly. The results suggest that eliminating REV-ERBα in astrocytes directly boosts NAD+ in the brain, pointing to a potential path for future treatments targeting neurodegeneration.

Drug Treatment Protects Against Tau Pathology

In a further experiment, the researchers blocked REV-ERBα using both genetic methods and a new drug that has also shown promise in studies of amyloid-β and Parkinson's disease. This approach increased NAD+ levels and shielded the mice from tau-related brain damage. Tau aggregates are known to disrupt brain function and drive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

The findings suggest that manipulating the body's internal clock -- specifically by inhibiting REV-ERBα -- could represent a new way to protect the brain, prevent tau buildup, and potentially slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","We Wirelessly Charged the Porsche Cayenne EV and Found Out Why the Charger Won't Fry Your Cat","https://www.wired.com/story/porsche-cayenne-ev-wireless-charging-wont-fry-your-cat/","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Yes, it's still a prototype, but Porsche is finally letting people experience what it's next electric car will be like when it hits production next year. We got a briefing on the underpinnings of the new architecture for the Cayenne Electric, peeked at the very fancy finalized interior, and experienced a few hot laps being driven by one of Porsche's professional drivers.

The charging pad.

However, the highlight was, oddly, none the above, it was getting to try out the Cayenne Electric's party trick and experience exactly how Porsche's wireless charging system works for the EV, and how ridiculously similar the process is to plonking your phone down on a Qi charging puck.

Reminiscent of BMW's 3.2-kilowatt 2018 attempt, this new wireless version from Porsche is finally fit for purpose because it can charge at the rates you get from EV home wall chargers—up to 11 kW. This means that just by rolling over the 50-kilogram floor pad, owners will be able to get a full charge on the electric SUV in 11 hours or so, brimming the 108-kWh battery overnight with no need to physically plug in. (Porsche covered a portion of my travel expenses to come see this in action.)

But how do you line up over that floor pad and get it in just the right spot to start charging when you can't see the black slab when, as you roll toward the pad, it disappears out of your line of sight? Porsche has naturally sought to use the cabin central screen that flicks to camera feed overlaid with red and green lines for guidance, plus a green circle to help you aim for that 11-kW charging sweet spot.

The car offers visual guides to get you into the proper position.

If you move the steering wheel on approach, the green lines move correspondingly on the central screen, which is split to show both a forward camera feed and a generated overhead view. (This is adapted from the car's Surround View parking function.) Once you're within spitting distance of the charger's ideal position, a solid green target appears on the overhead feed. Your job is then to corral the green circle onto this marker.

Once all is in place, the car takes over, applying the parking brake and starting the charge without you pressing a button. The transfer of energy between pad and car takes place over a distance of a few centimeters, which the Cayenne itself sets by lowering automatically to the correct height. The whole setup can be used both inside and outside, so Porsche's wireless charging isn't dependent on garage space.

The pad under the car.

But, for concerned pet owners, the important question is, most certainly, would transferring 11 kW through thin air using a magnetic field via the copper and ferrite coil in the base plate play havoc with a pooch or puss that decides to wander under the Cayenne Electric while you're topping up the battery?

It turns out that both science and Porsche have got your pets' backs here. As the coils are tuned to a frequency of around 85 kHz for EV wireless charging, no biological harm should be expected from magnetic fields in this range at these intensities. Energy transfer to living tissue is, thankfully, extremely inefficient; magnetic fields mostly pass through without inducing significant currents or heating.

In theory, small eddy currents could be induced in conductive tissues, causing mild local heating, but the power density would be far below thresholds for thermal damage. As for neurological or cardiac stimulation, the field would have to be thousands or even millions of times stronger before it could possibly affect a pet's nerves or heart.

That's some fast charging.

However, while energy transfer to living tissue is terrible, when metal gets introduced—such as might be found in a pet collar or held by a clumsy human fetching a wrench from under the EV—the situation changes, but only slightly. A metal collar might get noticeably warm, possibly uncomfortable after several minutes, but for this to occur the cat or dog would have to remain seated on the pad for several minutes during charge time, ignoring the rise in temperature of its collar and shunning the instinctive reflex to move away.

For good measure, Porsche has included a motion detector and foreign object detection in the floor plate, which instantly shuts down the charging process if a living being or metallic object (such as a wrench) comes between the vehicle and the plate. Radar sensors on each side of the plate can apparently detect anything bigger than a golf ball, and the range of these sensors extends to cover the entire front half of the car.

The result? If Fido crawls under the EV to fetch a ball and comes within a whisker of the tech, power transfer immediately stops, then automatically starts again when the system senses no living or inanimate object is on or near the pad.

The Cayenne's tidy interior.

When charging using a more conventional cable, the Cayenne Electric's 800-volt system can go from 10 to 80 percent in less than 16 minutes, and in just 10 minutes it can add more than 180 miles of range, with an optimal setup, of course. Porsche says the new SUV coming next year will be good for up to 373 miles of range on max charge.

Oddly, there's no vehicle-to-load capability, letting you power household electrical appliances from the car, like you can already with brands such as Hyundai and Kia. “No one has asked for V2L,"" I was told by Porsche reps. “As soon as people ask for it, we'll put it in.” Let's hold Porsche to that promise.

It's been a rocky road for Porsche's transition to electric, what with secondhand Taycan values plummeting. The brand will be hoping the 155-mph Cayenne will turn things around. And it just might. The good news for now, however, is that if you plump for the optional wireless charging, any inquisitive furry friends should have nothing to worry about.

A few weeks ago, bathroom and plumbing company Kohler debuted the Dekoda, a health and wellness sensor that lives on your toilet bowl and records signs of your gut health and hydration. Now, Withings has launched the U-Scan. First shown at CES in 2023, the U-Scan also sits inside the toilet bowl. A thermal sensor detects when a fresh, er, sample is being deposited. The U-Scan takes a small sample and analyzes it on-site with miniature biochemical sensors inside an interchangeable cartridge.

There are two separate U-Scans. U-Scan Nutrio analyzes your diet, checking for biomarkers like bio-acidity, hydration status, and ketone levels, which shows that you've started burning body fat instead of sugar. U-Scan Calci also checks for calcium, which is a sign that you might have kidney stones. Results are then transmitted via Wi-Fi to the Withings app.

The cartridges are replaceable, and the sensor comes with a docking station to clean and recharge the sensor. Purchasing the U-Scan comes with a complimentary subscription to Withings+, the company's upgraded app, which also includes a free consultation with a nutritionist.

The U-Scan packages start at $380, which comes with one U-Scan, either Nutrio or Calci, one cartridge, and two to four scans weekly (each cartridge lasts about 2.5 months). For more intensive monitoring, the Intensive package includes two cartridges for five to seven weekly measurements. Replacement cartridges are $100 for one cartridge or $180 for two, and Withings sends you the cartridge automatically depending on which package you select. The U-Scan is now available at Withings.com. We'll be testing it soon. —Adrienne So

Samsung has long offered its own browser on its smartphones—Samsung Internet—but now the app is finally available on another platform: Windows. Considering Samsung makes Windows laptops and Android phones, this move allows folks who use the company's browser to share their browsing history and bookmarks between phone and laptop, and if you have saved passwords with Samsung Pass, you can use it to autofill passwords on websites.

The company is taking this opportunity to bring some Galaxy AI features over as well, including Browsing Assist, which lets you instantly summarize webpages or translate them to another language. Samsung says its browser also blocks third-party web trackers, and there's a Privacy Dashboard that lets you see what has been blocked.

Samsung Internet for PC is only available as a beta right now, but anyone in the US or South Korea on Windows 11 or Windows 10 (version 1809 and above) can download it now.



Samsung also quietly teased its long-awaited trifold smartphone (a folding phone that has three screens) at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit this week in South Korea. The device, which doesn't have a name, was on display, but no one could touch it. Unlike the Huawei Mate XT, the phone's screens fold outward like a book. Samsung told SamMobile it still plans to launch this smartphone in 2025, perhaps as early as next week, though it may be restricted to a few markets for now, such as China and Korea.

Insta360 has released a smaller, lighter 360-degree camera, the X4 Air. The X4 Air is cheaper, too, though it lacks some features of the company's flagship model, the Insta360 X5. Still, for casual consumers looking to get started in 360 video, the X4 Air's $400 price makes it approachable.

Weighing 5.9 ounces (165 grams), the X4 Air is almost 2 ounces lighter than the X5. The body is also considerably smaller, making it easier to mount on helmets and other locations where weight and aerodynamics matter (a big reason why we like the GoPro Max 2 more than the Insta360 X5).

Like its larger cousin, the X5, the X4 Air is capable of 8K video, though it has smaller sensors and will likely deliver slightly lower quality video. The X5 uses a 1/1.28-inch sensor while the X4 Air uses a 1/1.8-inch sensor. Other differences include a less robust feature set. For example, the X4 Air lacks the 5.7K/60 fps Active HDR option of the X5, and as you would expect from a smaller body, battery life takes a hit; Insta360 is only claiming 88 minutes of 8K 30p footage versus the X5's claimed 100 minutes. —Scott Gilbertson

Nothing's phones have been a breath of fresh air in the design department, and the Nothing Phone (3) claimed a place in our Android phones guide because of its interesting aesthetic. Distinctly watered down in the specs and looks department (no circular Glyph Matrix display and just a single customizable LED on the back), the Nothing Phone (3a) Lite is a cheaper model aimed at the UK and Europe (it won't arrive in the US).

Available in black or white, the Nothing Phone (3a) Lite has that trademark translucent back with a subtle red highlight and a retro font that extends into the pixelated user interface. It has a 6.77-inch, 120 Hz, OLED screen, with a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chipset, 8 GB of RAM, and a choice of 128 or 256 GB of storage, but there's space for a microSD card on the flip side of the SIM tray. There's a decent 5,000 mAh battery, but the phone only supports wired charging at 33 watts.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The camera can be a weak spot for budget phones, though we were quite impressed by the regular Nothing Phone (3a) and (3a) Pro. The (3a) Lite has a solid 50-megapixel main camera with a large-ish 1/1.57-inch sensor and an f/1.8 aperture, though it's flanked by an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a macro lens, with a 16-megapixel shooter around front. IP54 water resistance, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.3 support round out the respectable specs.

Competitors abound in this price bracket, from Xiaomi's Poco sub-brand to OnePlus, so Nothing is relying on its unique look and interesting software customizations to help it stand out. The Nothing Phone (3a) Lite is available now at £249 (249 euros) for the 128 GB model or £279 (279 euros) for the 256 GB. —Simon Hill

OnePlus has been slowly dripping news about its next flagship smartphone over the last month, and now we finally have an official announcement date: November 13. So far, we know the OnePlus 15 will be one of the first smartphones powered by Qualcomm's next-gen Snapdragon 8 Elite 5 chipset. It likely moved up the launch of its smartphone (which was previously in January) to be among the first to launch with the new chip.

While OnePlus has officially ended its partnership with Hasselblad, it has been playing up a new image processing algorithm called DetailMax Engine to assure you that the cameras are still capable. Speaking of, there's a new mode called Ultra-Clear 26MP, which lets you capture photos at 26 megapixels for a sharper image. The phone otherwise has a new look and comes in Infinite Black, Ultra Violet, and Sand Storm. The latter color is the only one with a micro-arc oxidized metal frame, which offers a “ceramic-grade coating” that OnePlus claims is 1.3x harder than titanium mid frame. OnePlus says it will share more details, including pricing and availability, on November 13 via a livestream on its YouTube channel.

So what happened to the OnePlus 14? The number four is superstitious in China as it's similar to the word for death, so it's common to see companies skip the “fourth” generation or even “14” and go to the next number.

The Japan Mobility Show saw a raft of exciting new EVs being unveiled, but, for WIRED, smaller was most definitely better as Honda stole the limelight with the world premiere of its Super-ONE Prototype kei car, a ultracompact EV that will supposedly sound like a combustion hot hatch, complete with seven simulated gears to shift through via paddles on the steering wheel.

The Super-ONE is based on the regular Honda N-One, also an electric kei car, but here the tall and narrow stance is nicely offset by chunky wheel arches. Kei cars are limited to 64 horsepower but this version, destined for the Japanese and UK markets apparently, will likely get a power boost (to match the boost button on the steering wheel), when the production version arrives next year.

BYD has gone super small as well with its electric Racco, the brand's very first kei car (also shown off at the the Japan Mobility Show.) This one, however, is most definitely not a wannabe hot hatch with its short hood, upright windshield, sliding doors, and near-vertical rear end rounding out the total length of 133.7 inches. Those dinky 15-inch alloy wheels all boast disc brakes, too, but the car itself is front-wheel drive.

The 20 kWh battery should be good for around 112 miles of WLTC range, and despite the small size the Racco is expected to be compatible with fast charging of up to 100 kW—all for about $16,500. —Jeremy White

As a tech city, Portland often feels like a lifestyle destination for wayward engineers. Though nearly 10 percent of Portland works in tech, Stumptown's business scene can sometimes seem to be in hiding, operating as a comfortable “third place” between the FAANG capitals to the north and the south. Portland is a tree-filled place of sometimes startling natural beauty, resting in the shadow of Mount Hood, Oregon's tallest mountain, and at the intersection of two rivers.

Much of Portland's tech industry action is tucked into home offices and coworking spaces, or beneath a canopy of trees in the so-called Silicon Forest sprawling out to the west-side suburbs of Beaverton, Hillsboro, and Aloha. This is where Nvidia cofounder Jensen Huang went to high school, and it's also where he planted an engineering outpost for Nvidia. It's likewise where a sizable chunk of America's semiconductor and microchip industry has put down roots, including wings for Intel and Microsoft.

This low profile can make Portland a chill place to do business. Whatever the occasional national headlines, the city remains a mostly relaxed mecca for food and beer and music, and for always dressing like you're about to go on a hike. It is also a nerd's paradise for hacker spaces and tech ephemera. Here's where to stay, and where to go.

Don't just plop yourself down in a sleepy downtown hotel—a rookie Portland move many a visiting executive or engineer has come to regret. Portland is most workable where people actually live, amid dense business districts filled with cafés and restaurants. That's also where you'll find many of the coworking spaces and meeting resources that make doing business here easier, and the saunas and cold plunge tubs that make it pleasant.

Portland's downtown core hugs the west side of the Willamette River that bisects the city. But WIRED recommends finding a hotel on the amenity-packed central east side across the river from downtown, or in the more residential districts just outside of downtown on the west side.

900 E Burnside St., (503) 230-9200

The Jupiter NEXT hotel is the statement piece of Portland's eastside LoBu neighborhood just across the river from downtown, a modernist six-story sculpture of a building with a balcony, bamboo garden, and bookable meeting rooms for large or small groups. Corporate discounts and packages are available for frequent business travelers, which include complimentary drink tickets at Hey Love, a popular ground-floor cocktail bar that's a bit like a tropical fern bar from the '70s.

100 NE Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., (971) 346-2992

Not far from Jupiter NEXT is the only North American location of Icelandic hostel KEX, a 28-room boutique with private rooms and event spaces. For business travelers, KEX gets a good-neighbor discount at startup-centric coworking space CENTRL across the street, where you can book a meeting space or coworking berth. The downstairs lounge, Pacific Standard, offers oysters on the half shell and cocktails from internationally renowned bartender Jeffrey Morganthaler.

Near Jupiter and KEX: The immediate neighborhood includes music venue Nova, patio bar Rontoms, excellent pizza and hoagies at Dimo's Apizza, and terrific coffee from Roseline Coffee. Visitors can usually walk in for foie gras dumplings and steam burgers (which sound like a Simpsons joke and taste like heaven) at Canard, the wine-filled casual sister restaurant of James Beard Award-winning French prix-fixe spot Le Pigeon next door. High-rise luxury sauna and cold plunge spa Knot Springs, offering river views from hot or cold water, sits near KEX.

614 SW 11th Ave., (503) 224-3400

The best advice around Southwest Portland's downtown core is to stay above 9th Avenue, in the residential and restaurant-packed West End. Boutique hotel The Sentinel is within easy reach of the interstate, with corporate meeting spaces available and a classic seafood spot and steakhouse, Jake's Grill, on the bottom floor, along with a tasting room for one of the country's premier wineries, Domaine Serene.

Nearby: One of the most extravagant views of the city can be found at Bellpine, the top-floor bar and restaurant at the nearby Ritz-Carlton, whose first-floor food hall, Flock, offers excellent birria tacos and a surprisingly well-stocked wine cellar. Nearby Multnomah Whiskey Library offers one of the largest and most renowned whiskey cellars in the country.

1150 NW 9th Ave., (503) 220-1339

For longer stays, local execs tell us a favored location is the Marriott's Residence Inn at the edge of Portland's tony Pearl District just north of downtown, within easy reach of light rail to the airport—with small kitchenettes for leftovers or snacks, and an onsite gym and pool. This is a place to stay, and stay fit, while working away from home.

Nearby: A location of drop-in-friendly coworking space CENTRL is a brisk 14-minute walk away. Nearby Jamison square is a dense corner of upscale eateries and bars. The most acclaimed food in the neighborhood comes from nationally recognized Mexican chef Angel Medina, at prix-fixe Republica (reservations recommended) and its nearby a la carte cousin, Lilia Comedor.

329 NE Couch St., plus three more locations

CENTRL is a midsize West Coast chain of coworking spaces with four locations in Portland that offers flexible and low-friction arrangements for drop-in business travelers. This includes $40-per-day open-format day passes and private collaborative day offices ranging from $100 to $300 a day. Relatively low-frills meeting rooms are also rentable by the hour.

830 NE Holladay St.

WeWork is back from the brink these days, and Portland has one of the more modern locations, with flexible day work options and a pleasant enclosed patio—plus the requisite craft beer taps and table tennis. If your company has a WeWork membership, this is where you'll be—amid high rises overlooking Portland's convention district.

500 SW 116th Ave.

This luxe coworking space at the edge of Portland's western suburbs is a perfectly located way station for those doing business in the chip-filled Silicon Forest west of Portland. Day passes and meeting rooms are available, in a sleek and high-ceilinged space attuned to corporate clients, with an attached health club.

Portland was the earliest hotbed for third-wave craft coffee in America, and some of the best-regarded beans in the world come here to be roasted. Here are the spots that best let you mix excellent brew with Wi-Fi and a power outlet.

321 NE Davis St. and other locations

Roseline is a midsize roastery with a few locations around Portland that offers perhaps the best mix of work-friendly spaces and truly excellent coffee—ranging from forward-thinking light roast drip coffee to balanced espresso shots.

823 NW 23rd Ave.

Looking for a café where you're likely to find Portland tech intelligentsia? This sophisticated multi-roaster hall of espresso is your spot, with shots from far-flung roasters on offer. You'll need to show up early to get a prime table.

1229 SW 10th Ave.

In Downtown Portland's museum blocks, Behind the Museum Café is a lovely respite, opened by owner Tomoe Horibuchi with a focus on small Japanese snacks, excellent tea, and coffee from local roaster Extracto. Wi-Fi is free, and the tucked-away café often has seats (and outlets) available.

2181 NW Nicolai St.

Electrica is a brick-walled multi-roaster café that offers excellent tea, coffee roasted in Japan or Thailand, espresso tonic drinks, and Mexican-style coffee—all at the edge of an electric fixture store.

803 SE Stark St.

I have eaten at a lot of ramen spots, from New York to Los Angeles to Tokyo. Few in this country are on Toya's level, from its classic shoyu broth to wild modern inventions like a brothless ramen carbonara with hand-massaged noodles. The menu is equally schooled in sake and shochu highballs.

3808 N Williams Ave.

Akkapong “Earl” Ninsom founded multiple Thai restaurants in Portland that rank among the best in the country, including Beard-awarded prix-fixe Royal Thai restaurant Langbaan. None are as distinctive as EEM—a mix of tiki cocktail, slow-smoked Texas barbecue, and Thai curry that must be tasted to believe. You will order the white curry with brisket burnt ends. And you will talk about it to your friends for years.

960 SE 11th Ave.

There's no restaurant quite like Kachka—a vodka and dumpling-filled hall devoted to the food of the former Soviet world. Ask for the Ruskie Zakuski, an endless parade of Slavic treats including Kachka's iconic bright pink “herring under a fur coat” salad. Then order dumplings, from savory pelmeni to sour cherry vareniki, fine caviar with butter and blini, and flutes of infused vodka distilled by the restaurant. Prefer seafood? Try Kachka's newly opened Fabrika spinoff at 2117 NE Oregon St.

2225 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd.

Portland has multiple excellent classic steakhouses, notably downtown's El Gaucho and the 80-year-old Ringside Steakhouse. Argentine-inflected Ox is special, from its famous smoked bone-marrow clam chowder to the delicate chimichurri atop its prime cuts of beef. But Ox's true secret weapon is its facility with the farm-fresh vegetables that have made Portland dining famous, whether flash-fried cauliflower offset by sweet golden raisin or heirloom carrots dappled with truffle-salted pistachio. It's the rare steakhouse where I'd bring a vegetarian.

1015 NW Everett St.

The traditional haunt of Portland's startup tech industry, the Pearl District's Teardrop Lounge is a national landmark amid modern cocktail aficionados—Portland's equivalent to New York's Death & Co. You can reserve the Crybaby room next door, or just walk in to the horseshoe bar for apricot-chili cocktails or delicately balanced Manhattans infused with strawberry and basil. (For a smaller, more casual but equally accomplished cocktail haunt rightfully beloved by the city's bartenders, try Rum Club at 720 SE Sandy Blvd.)

1124 SW Alder St.

For some, only the impossible will do. In a hidden upstairs hall with the vibes that recall the secret library of a big game hunter, Multnomah Whiskey Library holds more than 1,500 liquor bottles that include some of the rarest whiskeys in existence—aspirational bottles some know only as rumor. The Library can be notoriously hard to get into. But there's a trick: Reserve ahead, with a two-hour, $25-per person hall pass that comes with champagne and valet service. (Scotch lovers can avail themselves instead of the Scotch Lodge, at 215 SE 9th Ave. Reserve ahead.)

2733 NE Broadway St.

You already know in your heart if you're a tiki person—if you have a pulse that quickens to the words “Smith and Cross” and the sounds of indoor weather. If this is you, Hale Pele is one of the best of its kind anywhere, stewarded by tiki legend Martin Cate of San Francisco's Smuggler's Cove. Hale is a more intimate affair than Cate's flagship. For this, it might even be better—but best for small groups.

4057 N Mississippi Ave.

There is a truly Portland style of food-filled pub, one you can find in most of the city's neighborhoods: a classic hardwood-burnished place with low orange light, oddly elegant cocktails, a carefully chosen beer list, a few off-track glasses of wine, and much better food than you'd expect. Maybe the most refined is North Portland's Interurban, a bastion of low-key excellence. Visit in good spirits. Enjoy the patio. (For a lower-key, punkier experience—with a terrific beer and cocktails and perhaps the city's best smash burgers—pop up the street to Tulip Shop Tavern at 825 N. Killingsworth St.)

Portland-area's Silicon Forest arguably sprouted in the mid-20th century with early electronics companies such as Tektronix, but the term was coined amid a 1980s boom in Japanese investment. Portland's western suburbs are now a hub for engineering talent and account for more than a tenth of the national semiconductor industry, boasting spokes of Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Here's where to eat and play when visiting west of Portland.

2088 NE Stucki Ave., Hillsboro

Hillsboro is the region's home for Indian dining, and there are always spirited arguments about which new hole-in-the-wall is the best in the area. But for decades, Chennai Masala has been Hillsboro's default answer for southern Indian food—a well-appointed room you want to spend time in and which can host large groups. Lunchtime is the buffet, but dinner is better, including some of the region's best crispy dosas, lentil crepes stuffed with spiced potato filling.

Excellent casual Indian restaurants: Some of the best biryani in the region can be found at an unassuming strip mall restaurant called Hyderabad Hub (18033 NE Evergreen Pkwy, Hillsboro). Apna Chat Bhavan (1815 NW 169th Place, Hillsboro) is a casual thali spot adjoined to a grocery store, with excellent Southern Indian specialties in particular.

8225 SW Apple Way, Suite 102

Beaverton is a short hop from the largest semiconductor and chip plants of Hillsboro. It's also the hotbed for Korean food in the region. Just at Beaverton's border with Portland, Hansik is a new and buzzy entry with plenty of space for larger groups, and a reputation for excellent grilled meats—including a prime rib ssam set with a variety of greens to wrap up the tender meat, and sizzling stone griddle bibimbap, plus indulgent tteokbokki rice cake appetizers and hearty, spicy yuk gae jang beef soup.

More excellent Korean food: For terrific Korean fried chicken and late-night snacks and drinks, stop in at 1st Street Pocha (12590 SW 1st St., Beaverton). Comfortingly homestyle Korean soups and dumplings, plus seasonal noodle dishes, are tucked in an upstairs nook in the back of G-Mart supermarket at Always Spring (3975 SW 114th Ave., Beaverton). Old-school Korean fare with excellent seafood pancakes, spicy tofu stews, and endless banchan can be had at Nak Won (​​4600 SW Watson Ave., Beaverton).

4500 SW Watson Ave., Beaverton

In a capacious former bank building with vaulted ceilings, find more local beer than some states even brew. Loyal Legion offers cocktails, pub food, and 99 taps of Oregon beer—from lager cleaner than spring water to the hypiest hazy and silly mango lime sour.

1458 NE 25th Ave., Hillsboro

Near the largest tech plants of Hillsboro sits an unlikely wonder: quite plausibly the world's second biggest arcade. Routinely named the universe's best place to play pinball, Next Level is a 650-game hall of blinking lights and plungers, not to mention the home to a 25,000-item museum of cultural ephemera ranging from lunch boxes to action figures. It is the endless house that nerd built.

Portland Japanese Garden, 611 SW Kingston Ave.

With spaces designed by revered architect Kengo Kuma, the Portland Japanese Garden is widely regarded as the purest example of its form outside Japan—a serene space of cultivated wabi-sabi and serenity that was first dedicated 60 years ago. Little like it exists in this hemisphere.

Start at Breakside Brewery, 1570 NW 22nd Ave.

Portland doesn't have a signature cuisine or dish, like gumbo in New Orleans. What it does have is beer. Portland is one of the oldest and densest craft beer scenes in America, and maybe the best. Northwest Portland's Slabtown neighborhood offers a great walking tour. Begin at Breakside Brewery, possibly the most award-winning brewery in the state, and drink literally anything: IPA, lager, stout, or sour. A block away, at Ruse Brewing (1505 NW 21st Ave.), delight in Detroit-style pizza and some of the state's best IPAs and lagers. A 10-minute walk takes you to Brujos Brewing (2377 NW Wilson St.), a metal-themed brewery known nationwide for super-saturated hazy IPAs and big-bodied stouts.

On the East Side: Among the myriad breweries in the inner east side, the two that most reward visits aren't far from each other. Stop by the spacious patio of Wayfinder Beer (304 SE 2nd Ave.) for the city's best selection of lagers. Pair terrifically balanced IPAs with truly excellent pub grub at Grand Fir Brewing (1403 SE Stark St.)

Powell's City of Books, 1005 W Burnside St.

In a city with few traditional visitor attractions, one of the most common suggestions is that you should go to a bookstore. Powell's City of Books, a four-story bookstore at the edge of Portland's downtown that takes up an entire city block, is an impressive monument to books—often the first thing a visitor to Portland will remember when they think of the city. Ogle the estimable rare book room and the museum of vintage typewriters.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 1974, five years before he wrote his Pulitzer Prize–winning book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, Douglas Hofstadter was a graduate student in physics at the University of Oregon. When his doctoral adviser went on sabbatical to Regensburg, Germany, Hofstadter tagged along, hoping to practice his German. The pair joined a group of brilliant theoretical physicists who were agonizing over a particular problem in quantum theory. They wanted to determine the energy levels of an electron in a crystal grid placed near a magnet.

Hofstadter was the odd one out, unable to follow the others' line of thought. In retrospect, he's glad. “Part of my luck was that I couldn't keep up with them,” he said. “They were proving theorems, but they had nothing to do with the essence of the situation.”

Hofstadter instead decided to test out a more down-to-earth approach. Rather than proving theorems, he was going to crunch some numbers using an HP 9820A desk calculator—a computerlike machine that weighed nearly 40 pounds and could be programmed to perform complex computations.

Hofstadter needed it to solve a particular formulation of the Schrödinger equation, which lies at the core of quantum mechanics. When fed certain information about an electron and its environment as inputs, the Schrödinger equation describes how the electron will behave. In particular, its solutions tell you the amount of energy the electron can have.

In the case that Hofstadter was interested in, the Schrödinger equation includes a variable called alpha, the product of the magnetic field's strength and the area of one grid square. Alpha captures information about the forces acting on the electron.

Douglas Hofstadter is the author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, which examines the self-referential nature of mathematics, music, and more.

The team of mathematicians in Germany knew that when alpha was rational—that is, either a whole number or a fraction—solving the Schrödinger equation was arduous but possible (so long as you had a big enough calculator). But when alpha was irrational, meaning that it could not be written as a fraction, they had no idea how to solve it.

Instead of struggling with the irrational case like his colleagues, Hofstadter started with what he knew. He programmed his calculator to take a rational value of alpha as an input and print the output on a roll of paper. The result represented the electron's permitted and forbidden energy levels.

Every evening, Hofstadter would leave his calculator whirring. The next morning, he'd return to a scroll of paper unfurling from the machine, listing the locations of the permitted energies for each rational value of alpha he'd set as an input. He taped together a few pieces of graph paper and, using a felt-tip pen, began meticulously graphing these energy values. That picture would come to be known as the Hofstadter butterfly, because of the resemblance of the graph's negative space to the insect's patterned wings.

When a crystal is placed near a magnet, its electrons can only have certain amounts of energy. These energy values depend on the crystal's magnetic flux, which measures how much force the electron is subjected to. In 1974, Hofstadter graphed this phenomenon.

The completed graph (bottom) has since been named the Hofstadter butterfly.

Hofstadter's colleagues couldn't understand the point of his laborious approach. They joked that he was trying to spin straw into gold and took to calling his calculator “Rumpelstilzchen.”

Even his adviser dismissed the effort as “numerology” and threatened to drop his funding. “He was implying that I was being superstitious and talking nonsense,” Hofstadter said. “Finding meaning and patterns in numbers when they don't exist.”

But the butterfly that began to emerge on his graph paper intrigued him. Hofstadter noticed that when he entered a fraction, the allowed energies would be broken up by long stretches of forbidden values. As the fraction got more complicated, with more digits in the denominator, the breaks between possible energies got more numerous. The energy values began forming a visually striking pattern—a fractal, meaning that smaller parts of it looked the same as the whole.

His gut told him that it reflected a deep mathematical truth. “It was very clear to me that I had a tiger by the tail,” he said. He recognized the tiger. It was the Cantor set.

The set is named for the mathematician Georg Cantor, who popularized it in 1883 by following a simple rule: Take a line segment, split it into three equal sections, then erase the middle third. This leaves you with two segments separated by a gap. Now erase the middle third of each of these, and so on. If you carry out this procedure infinitely many times, you get an infinite set of points, spread out like dust along the number line.

Hofstadter would never plug in an irrational value of alpha. Irrational numbers can't be expressed as a fraction—it would require infinitely many digits in the numerator or denominator, something that was impossible to program the calculator to handle. But he noticed that as the rational values of alpha got closer and closer to an irrational number, the set of permitted energy values—the bands of ink in each row of his butterfly picture—looked more and more like a Cantor set. And so, he hypothesized, when alpha was irrational, the possible energies would form an actual Cantor set.

Several years later, two prominent mathematicians came to the same conclusion from a very different direction. Barry Simon and Mark Kac had been studying what they called almost-periodic functions. The outputs of a periodic function, like a sine wave, repeat over and over again. But an almost-periodic function traces out a path that comes very close to repeating, yet never does.

In 1981, Kac and Simon met for lunch and got to discussing the version of the Schrödinger equation that Hofstadter and his colleagues were trying to solve. When alpha was an irrational value, the equation turned into an almost-periodic function. It was exactly the kind of phenomenon they'd been studying. And based on what they knew about almost-periodic functions, Hofstadter was right: The allowed energy levels should form a Cantor set when alpha is irrational.

But Simon and Kac couldn't prove it either. Kac said he'd buy 10 martinis for anyone who could. Simon began to publicize Kac's offer, and the problem became known as the 10 martini conjecture.

The mathematician Mark Kac once offered 10 martinis to whoever could solve an important problem in quantum theory. He died before the proof was completed in 2004. Above, a group of mathematicians who worked on the problem celebrate the proof in his honor at a conference held that year.

Over the years, mathematicians chipped away at it, proving the conjecture for certain irrational values of alpha (but not all). Simon announced one of these intermediate results in 1982. Kac offered him three martinis. When Kac died in 1984, the problem remained open. A proof worth all 10 martinis wouldn't appear for another 20 years.

In 2003, Svetlana Jitomirskaya, who had spent years studying the almost-periodic function embedded in the Schrödinger equation, had just given up on her career-long goal of proving the 10-martini conjecture. A year earlier, a competitor named Joaquim Puig had proved it for all but a few classes of irrational alpha values. What's more, he'd used techniques she'd published earlier to do it. “I was kicking myself,” she said. “All the hard work was in my proof, and then here he comes with this beautiful argument.”

So she was surprised when a 24-year-old mathematician named Artur Avila visited her and suggested they work on the remaining values of alpha. “I told him it would be very difficult, very time consuming, and no one would care,” she said.

People did. Their proof, which they posted online in 2005, was eventually published in the Annals of Mathematics, the field's most prestigious journal. Avila later won a Fields Medal in part for his work on the problem.

They decided to honor the 10-martini contract themselves. “We had plenty of celebratory beverages, martinis included,” Jitomirskaya said.

Svetlana Jitomirskaya has spent decades studying subtle patterns that emerge from the quantum behavior of electrons.

But in some ways, the proof was a bit unsatisfying. Jitomirskaya and Avila had used a method that only applied to certain irrational values of alpha. By combining it with an intermediate proof that came before it, they could say the problem was solved. But this combined proof wasn't elegant. It was a patchwork quilt, each square stitched out of distinct arguments.

Moreover, the proofs only settled the conjecture as it was originally stated, which involved making simplifying assumptions about the electron's environment. More realistic situations are messier: Atoms in a solid are arranged in more complicated patterns, and magnetic fields aren't quite constant. “You've verified it for this one model, but what does that have to do with reality?” said Simon Becker, a mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.

These more realistic situations require you to tweak the part of the Schrödinger equation where alpha appears. And when you do, the 10-martini proof stops working. “This was always disturbing to me,” Jitomirskaya said.

The breakdown of the proof in these broader contexts also implied that the beautiful fractal patterns that had emerged—the Cantor sets, the Hofstadter butterfly—were nothing more than a mathematical curiosity, something that would disappear once the equation was made more realistic.

Avila and Jitomirskaya moved on to other problems. Even Hofstadter had doubts. If an experiment ever saw his butterfly, he'd written in Gödel, Escher, Bach, “I would be the most surprised person in the world.”

But in 2013, a group of physicists at Columbia University captured his butterfly in a lab. They placed two thin layers of graphene in a magnetic field, then measured the energy levels of the graphene's electrons. The quantum fractal emerged in all its glory. “Suddenly it went from a figment of the mathematician's imagination to something practical,” Jitomirskaya said. “It became very unsettling.”

She wanted to explain it with mathematics. And a new collaborator had an idea for how to do it.

In 2019, Lingrui Ge joined Jitomirskaya's group. He had been inspired by the work she and Avila had done on the 10-martini problem, as well as by a direction of research that Avila had been trying to pursue ever since.

Avila had grown tired of the piecemeal approaches that mathematicians used to understand almost-periodic functions. He instead began to develop what he called a “global theory”—a way to uncover higher-level structure in all sorts of almost-periodic functions, which he could then use to solve entire classes of functions in one go.

Lingrui Ge helped develop a new way to understand the solutions to almost-periodic functions, important equations that appear in quantum physics.

To do this, he associated a geometric object to a given almost-periodic function and studied its properties. He realized that some of those geometric properties could help him solve the original function.

But it only worked for certain types of functions. It couldn't handle the types of calculations that the 10-martini problem required. It wasn't clear that it ever could.

That's because to prove the 10-martini conjecture, mathematicians had to first transform the Schrödinger equation into a related equation called its dual, then solve that new equation. Avila's theory couldn't say anything about the higher-level structure of the dual.

Or so he thought. But Ge was intrigued by the geometric objects that Avila had described. He suspected that other properties of those objects hid even more information—information that might illuminate aspects of the dual equation. “I could see that it was a very beautiful and important theory,” Ge said.

He and Jitomirskaya—along with Jiangong You and Qi Zhou of Nankai University in China—figured out a new way to interpret Avila's geometric object and apply it to the dual. This made the theory far more powerful. It also allowed Ge, Jitomirskaya, and You to write a single proof that solved versions of the 10-martini problem in lots of different settings. No patchwork quilt needed.

The result cements the Hofstadter butterfly as a real-life phenomenon. The abstract world of number theory holds power in the world of physics.

The mathematicians have since used their version of Avila's global theory to solve two other key problems in the area. They predict that this is just the beginning of what they can do with the method they've uncovered. “We found this hidden mystery behind the global theory,” Ge said. “It was like a beacon on a dark sea that showed us the right direction.”

Balsam Hill

You can spend hours scrolling through lists of the best artificial Christmas trees and still end up wondering what to buy. How real does it actually look? Is it appropriately full? Does it shed? Are the branches strong enough to hold that lopsided homemade macaroni ornament you've hung on your tree since 2004?

We decided to settle the debate once and for all by bringing the best-selling artificial trees from three leading brands into a studio for a blind-judged contest. We got 10 trees from Balsam Hill, King of Christmas, and National Tree Company, then found 10 assemblers to put the trees together and fluff them. Next, our panel of three interior-designer judges assessed the results.

Crucially, the judges didn't know the brand or price of each tree—they picked the winners based on what they could see and touch. There were some surprises along the way, and we learned quickly that sometimes the gift in the biggest, shiniest box isn't the best.

Be sure to check out WIRED's other seasonal buying guides, including the best smart Christmas lights, advent calendars, and stocking stuffers.

Making the Cut

We researched artificial Christmas trees online to see what other publications and user reviews had to say, and then lined up the 10 most popular and talked-about trees.

Among them were Balsam Hill's Classic Blue Spruce, National Tree Company's enduring favorite Dunhill Fir, and an Amazon best-seller you can get for under $300.

All trees were the same height at 7.5 feet, and judged under the same studio lighting and free of ornaments. The prices ranged from $170 to $1,700. (All prices shown below are for 7.5-foot-tall trees.) We accepted review samples of seven of the trees and purchased the other three. In the end, we had $9,540 worth of trees assembled in a rented studio.

How We Tested the Trees

The trees were delivered to my home and then transported to a photo studio in Overland Park, Kansas, where 10 testers gathered on a Wednesday morning. Everything, from assembly to evaluation, was monitored and done under controlled conditions to ensure a fair comparison. The assemblers knew which brand and model of tree they had, but were not told about the cost or reputation. Some of the trees came with included gloves to help in the fluffing process, but we issued utilitarian latex gloves to anyone who didn't have them. Assemblers had an hour and a half to unbox, unload, build, and fluff each tree; most were fully assembled in about 45 minutes.

Each volunteer assembler chose a spot around the studio and was assigned a numbered box. “It feels like Christmas!” said one assembler as the timer started and everyone slicing the tape on their boxes, sending cardboard scattering across the room. Tree stands were built and branches carefully unpacked and snapped into the tree base, then fluffed and bent into shape in time for the judges to arrive. Everyone had the same amount of time to assemble and fluff their tree, all of which were the same size.

How We Scored the Trees

Once the trees were ready, three judges—interior designers from Kansas City-based firm ML Designs—arrived to evaluate them and pick the best fake Christmas tree.

Each judge was given scorecards with a rubric that added up to 25 total points. The judges scored each tree on five categories on a scale of 1 to 5: realism, fullness and shape, branch structure, needle quality, and overall appeal. The goal was to find out which tree truly looks the best when there's no logo or price tag swaying opinion. In the end, the top tree got 72 out of a possible 75 points while the bottom tree scored 32 (our judges admitted to being on the nice side—only one gave a score of 1).

Meet the Judges

• Maureen Lindstrom is a principal at ML Designs in Kansas City, Missouri, with 15 years of interior design experience.

• Marianne Mayer is a senior designer at ML Designs with 10 years of inerior design experience.

• Jill Connard, also with ML Designs, has been in the interior design space for 15 years.

Balsam Hill

Balsam Hill

Balsam Hill trees are well-known among fake Christmas tree enthusiasts for their ability to mimic the look and feel of fresh-cut evergreen trees. The company has been around since 2006 and is often found atop lists of the best artificial trees. We found that the brand twinkled brightly in a blind competition, without relying on reputation. Balsam Hill's Vermont White Spruce caught eyes the minute it emerged from the box and ended up tied for the top spot on our judges' ballots. No other tree compared in thickness, and it looked incredibly luxurious. “This is like the Hermès of Christmas trees,” said one assembler as she unwrapped the first section.

The tree's branches slope upward naturally, making it easy to hang ornaments, and the mix of needle types gives it a realistic texture. “It's very lush. It looks and feels expensive,” one judge noted. She also pointed out that there was no shedding, and judge Marianne Mayer agreed that the branches were extremely sturdy. The tree also comes pre-lit with LED lights that you can control with an app—get the model which does both color and clear if you want the option of having either white or colored Christmas lights. Most importantly, it looked lifelike, full, and festive without much fluffing.

Score: 72 of 75

King of Christmas

Flocked trees—that is, trees covered in artificial white snow made from a blend of cellulose fibers and adhesive—can be divisive. You either love them or hate them, and our judges are fans. (Then again, several assemblers who said they are not typically fans were still wowed by this tree.) King of Christmas' King Flock, meant to mimic a subalpine fir, nails the fresh-snow look, something that's often surprisingly hard to pull off. Its branches are incredibly thick, which makes the tree look full and realistic. Hanging ornaments may prove to be a little tricky, but the winter wonderland look is still stunning.

King of Christmas is a top-rated artificial Christmas tree brand with options that run from extremely inexpensive ($280) to ultra high-end ($3,300). The King Flock is one of the brand's signature models, and the tree also comes with some techy perks: its assembler was stoked to discover an included remote for changing the lights and setting a timer. After we wrapped, he did add that disassembling the tree was a lot tougher than putting it up, but the shedding was still pretty minimal for a flocked tree—you won't end up feeling like someone set off a glitter bomb in your living room. “This one feels like Christmas,” Maureen Lindstrom pointed out during judging. Hard to beat that!

Score: 71 of 75

King of Christmas

King of Christmas (LED)

This tree screams classic and cozy. When you think of a nostalgic Christmas, you think of this tree. Aside from some built-in lights, there aren't a whole lot of frills, which is exactly the point. King of Christmas nails the balance of realism and fullness here, blending PE and PVC needles that mimic real pine while filling out the shape. The result is a full, voluptuous-looking tree without too much bulkiness. Judge Marianne Mayer appreciated its ""well-balanced and sturdy"" structure and highlighted the tree's rich color.

Score: 67 of 75

Balsam Hill

Balsam Hill

Balsam Hill's Balsam Fir makes a strong first impression with its full shape and soft, light-green hue. Its sturdy branches can easily support heavy ornaments without sagging, and there was almost no shedding. Up close, though, judges noticed that some of the magic faded a bit: the branches appeared waxy, and judge Jill Connard pointed out that the needles are also flat, which takes away from the realism. Overall, it's a tree that balances a realistic silhouette with practical durability, which is perfect if you love your tree stocked with ornaments.

Score: 59 of 75

National Tree Company

National Tree Company (Unlit)

If you're the type who wants to manipulate your tree every which way, National Tree Company's Dunhill Fir is for you. Its assembler praised its “extremely pliable” branches, which made it easy to fluff from the bottom up. The result was a classic, dark-green tree that looks full and natural. Judge Maureen Lindstrom noted that the wrapped inner pole added to the realism: “Like it was just pulled off a truck."" Between the flexible branches and soft needles, this tree is perfect for hands-on decorators who want to fluff, shape, and customize every inch.

Score: 58 of 75

Balsam Hill

Balsam Hill (Unlit)

This Fraser Fir earned its spot for ease of assembly. Its assembler had the tree fully set up in mere minutes, needed minimal fluffing time, and spent the rest of the hour tinkering just to see if he could make it look any better than it already did. As a whole, all three judges thought the tree looked great: Lindstrom said the needles looked good from afar, and Connard concurred. Up close, though, Lindstrom noted the needles felt pretty plasticky and the branches felt weak, adding that “it feels like you might come down in the morning to find all of the ornaments have fallen off.” Mayer agreed that the branches are a bit weak at the tips, but sturdy enough at the base. Overall, it's a quick-to-assemble, solid-looking tree that may be best dressed in just lights and ribbons.

Score: 55 of 75

King of Christmas

King of Christmas (LED)

King of Christmas's Yorkshire Fir isn't going to fool anyone up close, but it's not without its charms. Judge Jill Connard complimented the branch placement, which gives the tree a great overall shape. However, Mayer noted that the trunk is pretty visible despite fluffing, and the needles have a somewhat papery feel, so it's not exactly main tree energy. Still, with a tidy silhouette and good color, the Yorkshire Fir could happily find its home in a secondary or softly lit space.

Score: 49 of 75

Balsam Hill Classic Blue Spruce for $799: The Classic Blue Spruce from Balsam Hill has a nostalgic look that many seek in an artificial Christmas tree. However, judges agreed that it didn't feel premium; Lindstrom noted it reminded her of her first-ever tree as a young adult. Mayer appreciated the brown tones in the needles for added realism, but felt that the tree lacked an upscale feel. The tree's silhouette loses fullness toward the top, and up-close inspection of the branches and needles leaves more to be desired. Despite qualms, it remains a solid, middle-grade option for those seeking a traditional look. Score: 47.5 of 75

Hykolity Artificial Christmas Tree for $130: This one is one of Amazon's top sellers, and has a 4.5-star average rating, so we had to test it. It mostly delivered on expectations; judges agreed that it'd be best suited as a budget-friendly option or in a kids' room. If you look closely, you can see the branch wire, but judge Mayer summed it up nicely: “There's a place for every tree.” On the plus side, the needles looked pretty realistic, and the lights included were good quality. One assembler noted that each light strand needs to be plugged into the next after assembly, which was a little confusing at first, but otherwise setup was pretty straightforward, and the price tag is inviting. Score: 46 of 75

National Tree Company Dunhill Fir (Pre-Lit) for $361: This one shocked everyone in the studio, especially when compared to its fraternal twin, the non-pre-lit Dunhill Fir, which ranked much higher. Dubbed the “Charlie Brown Tree” by both judges and assemblers, it looked very bare even after lots of fluffing. The top branch wouldn't sit upright for a star or angel; cords were exposed throughout, and there were large gaps that couldn't quite be hidden by fluffing. What looked promising in product photos didn't translate in person, making this one a disappointing pick for anyone hoping for a full, reliable tree. Score: 32 of 75

What Size Do You Need?

A good rule of thumb is to choose a tree that leaves about 6 to 12 inches between the top (with the topper on) and your ceiling. For standard 8-foot ceilings, a 7- or 7.5-foot tree usually looks best. Smaller spaces like apartments or secondary rooms work better with 6-foot or slim trees.

Is a Fake Tree More Sustainable Than a Real Christmas Tree?

It depends on how long you use it. Most artificial trees are made from PVC and metal, which aren't biodegradable. But if you keep the same tree for more than five years, it can have a lower carbon footprint than buying a real tree every year, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.

What Is the Estimated Life Span of a Fake Tree?

The lifespan of an artificial Christmas tree depends on its quality, materials, and care. On average, a good-quality tree can last 7 to 10 years, while higher-end models may last up to 15 years with proper maintenance.

Is a Fake Tree More Affordable?

Over time, yes. While a quality artificial tree is an investment upfront, you'll save money by reusing it year after year. Plus, there are no yearly disposal costs.

How Should You Store Your Tree?

Disassemble the tree carefully, compress the branches, and store it in a sturdy tree bag or the original box. Keep it in a cool, dry place like a closet or basement. Humidity or direct heat can cause damage or dust buildup.

What Is Needed to Complete a Tree?

A finished Christmas tree is whatever you want to make of it. You can add a topper, a tree skirt or collar, ornaments, and lights. You can also throw in some ribbon, garlands, or decorative picks for extra texture and depth.

What Makes a Tree Look Real?

According to Balsam Hill, PE (polyethylene) is the preferred needle material for replicating the look of real trees. “The needles of PE trees have the shape, thickness, and mass of a true tree branch,” the website states.

When Should You Put Your Tree Up, and When Should You Take It Down?

It's entirely up to you! Traditionally, trees go up after Thanksgiving and come down after New Year's Day.

How Do You Fluff Your Tree?

Start at the bottom and work your way up, using your hands to separate and spread out each branch and tip to fill gaps. Shape branches in different directions for a natural look. It takes some time, but it's the key to a full, realistic-looking tree. Depending on the tree, you may need protective gloves to protect your hands from poky branches and needles.

Is It Better to Get Pre-Lit or to Do it Yourself?

Pre-lit trees are plenty convenient, but replacing lights can be tricky if they burn out. Unlit trees give you more flexibility to switch up light colors or styles year to year.

How Do You Put Lights on a Christmas Tree, and How Many Feet Do You Need?

Govee recommends about 100 lights per foot of tree height. For example, a 7-foot tree would call for about 700 lights. How many lights per food is dependent on brand; check out the brand we recommend in our guide to the Best Smart Christmas Lights.

What Is Flocking and How Do You Do It?

Flocking is the process of adding artificial snow to a tree. You can buy pre-flocked trees or DIY it by using spray-on snow or flocking powder. Beware! This can get messy, so always do it outside and let it fully dry before decorating.

How Can You Keep Pets Away From Your Tree?

If pets are messing with your tree, anchor the tree securely by using a sturdy, weighted tree stand. If it still feels wobbly, place heavy objects like sandbags or small weights on the stand's legs to make it more bottom-heavy.

Avoid low-hanging ornaments and skip tinsel, which can be inviting for curious paws. Using a decorative fence or baby gate can also help keep pets away.

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: Why is Amazon laying off 14,000 people in the middle of an AI boom — and is it really a boom at all? We dig into the contradiction at the heart of Seattle's tech scene, discussing Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's “world's largest startup” rationale and what it says about the company's culture and strategy. And we debate whether AI progress represents true transformation or the familiar signs of a tech bubble in the making.

Then we examine the vision of Cascadia high-speed rail — the ambitious plan to connect Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, B.C., by bullet train. Is it the regional infrastructure needed to power the Pacific Northwest's next chapter, or an expensive dream looking for a purpose?

Inventprise, a Redmond, Wash.–based biotechnology company developing vaccines for infectious diseases, is laying off 76 workers, according to a new filing from the Washington Employment Security Department.

GeekWire has reached out to the company for additional details. 

The layoffs impact employees across the company's Redmond and Woodinville facilities, as well as some remote workers. The first separations are effective Dec. 31. 

Job titles affected span a wide range of roles, including manufacturing, quality control, R&D, and technical staff, according to the filing.

The company has nearly 200 employees, according to LinkedIn.

Founded in 2012, Inventprise focuses on addressing global health challenges in low- and middle-income countries. Its pipeline includes lead candidate IVT-PCV-25, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate that is in Phase 2 trials, according to the company's website.

Inventprise was founded by Dr. Subhash Kapre, who previously worked on vaccine initiatives with the Gates Foundation. The Seattle-based foundation has provided more than $13 million to Inventprise. 

Kapre is currently chairman of Inventprise, which is led by CEO Yves Leurquin, a former Takeda exec who joined the company in 2021.

Neil Kumar has been known to leave a water bottle or a jacket at school or the gym, marking himself among the millions of Americans whose forgotten belongings end up in a lost-and-found box or a landfill every year.

Now Kumar is the founder of FindIt, an app designed to provide an AI-powered solution to recovering what's been lost.

The 15-year-old freshman at Bellevue (Wash.) High School was recently selected as one of four innovators to participate in the city's Civic Innovation Challenge, an initiative seeking technology solutions to municipal challenges.

FindIt will be used on a pilot basis at Bellevue College to test the app's usability and effectiveness among students, staff and visitors and evaluate its potential for broader deployment.

“I've always been interested in how technology can solve our real world problems,” Kumar told GeekWire. 

According to statistics cited by the website Lostings, over 400 million items are lost and found every year in the U.S. The estimated value of lost items is over $5 billion per year.

Kumar wants his creation to help address the economic aspect of all of that loss, and also the sustainability concern. His tagline is “Buy less, lose even less.”

Available on iOS, FindIt works when someone in charge of a lost-and-found system, at a school for instance, takes a photo of a recovered item and uploads that photo. The image is processed by artificial intelligence, which generates a description, such as “blue water bottle with red sticker and white top.”

A student looking for a lost item types a description into FindIt, and the app's AI scans uploaded listings to find the best matches.

Kumar said the easy process of searching via a mobile app eclipses traditional systems that require a person to physically return to a place where they may have left something.

He started working on the project a year ago and FindIt was among 23 competitive applicants reviewed and judged in the civic challenge. The three other companies and ideas that were accepted are: 

FindIt was also selected for the Thermo Fisher Junior Innovators Challenge, and Kumar said he was recognized in the top 300 junior innovators in the U.S. this year. 

The app is currently deployed at Odle Middle School in Bellevue. Kumar envisions the tool someday being available to more schools as well as airports, workplaces, public transit agencies and elsewhere.

Kumar, who has worked with Sustainability Ambassadors, a program that helps develop student leadership skills, thinks FindIt is just the start, and he'd like to be an entrepreneur in the future. 

“I like to solve problems using technology, and help people using those solutions,” he said.

Bending Spoons' four cofounders this week joined the billionaire ranks.

CEO Luca Ferrari's stake in the Milan-based tech conglomerate is now reportedly worth $1.4 billion, while cofounders Matteo Danieli, Luca Querella, and Francesco Patarnello each hold stakes worth $1.3 billion, according to Forbes estimates based on shareholder data published by the Italian Business Register.

The valuations come on the heels of Bending Spoons' latest funding round: $270 million from investors including T. Rowe Price and earlier backers Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, Durable Capital Partners, and Fidelity, plus a $440 million secondary share sale by existing shareholders. It's unclear whether any of the cofounders sold stock in the secondary transaction. Bending Spoons has declined to comment on its cofounders' stakes.

Despite its catchy name, Bending Spoons has stayed remarkably under the radar. The 12-year-old outfit typically makes headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its growing portfolio — most recently this past week, when it agreed to acquire AOL. for an undisclosed amount.

But Bending Spoons isn't a traditional private equity firm or a pure financial investment vehicle. Its focus is on acquiring underperforming but popular tech brands, then transforming them to serve millions of users more efficiently. 

The company tends to make news when it restructures these acquired companies, often through significant layoffs, or makes controversial changes to beloved products — or both in the case of Evernote and WeTransfer.

Still, Bending Spoons itself remains largely unknown, even though its roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here's what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet's most recognizable brands.

Bending Spoons describes itself as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 “Spooners,” its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created.

However, it didn't start that way — the Bending Spoons' founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus.

The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that participated in Disrupt SF 2011's Startup Alley and raised seed funding for its photo sharing app, Wink. 

Evertale failed not long after, and investors got an out, but its founders and a couple of employees kept working together, initially on in-house apps. Soon enough, the team made its first acquisition, followed by many others, CEO and cofounder Luca Ferrari told the 20VC podcast in a rare interview. 

In 2020, Bending Spoons made an exception when it created and donated Immuni, Italy's official COVID-19 contact tracing app. But other than that, it has mostly been honing a formula: Bending Spoons identifies a popular product it thinks it can improve inside and out, and buys it from owners who have reached their limits.

After the acquisition, Bending Spoons is anything but a passive owner, making changes to the products' user experience and features but also to the underlying tech; monetization strategy, including pricing; and team organization, including headcount.

While this focus on efficiency and revenue overlaps with private equity strategies, Bending Spoons claims a key difference: it “aims to hold forever, and has never sold an acquired business.” It is building a live portfolio, not collecting internet relics or presiding over a tech graveyard.

To be clear, Bending Spoons' acquisition targets so far haven't necessarily been failing businesses — many still had substantial user bases and revenue. But they've tended to be stagnant, neglected, or had owners looking to exit. Let's recap these key deals, and also what happened in their aftermath.

While Bending Spoons acquired several companies between 2014 and 2021, including AI photo enhancer Remini, its most notable acquisitions happened more recently.

In 2022, it acquired Filmic, known for its popular video and photo editing apps, and laid off the entire staff in December 2023.

In a deal also announced in 2022 and finalized in early 2023, Bending Spoons also cquired Evernote, the note-taking app that had reportedly reached a $1 billion valuation before hitting trouble. Layoffs followed the acquisition, as well as cuts to Evernote's free offering.

The first half of following year, 2024, was particularly active, with the acquisition of Meetup, app maker Mosaic Group, and Hopin's StreamYard in the first half of the year. 

In July 2024, it went on to acquire the publishing platform Issuu and the file transfer service WeTransfer, where it later cut staff and made changes to its free plan, introducing stricter limits. Later in the year, Bending Spoons announced it would spend $233 million on an all-cash take-private deal to acquire video platform Brightcove. 

The acquisitions have continued apace in 2025, with acquisitions that include the outdoors route planner Komoot and management software maker Harvest. 

Bending Spoons also announced its intention to acquire Vimeo in a $1.38 billion all-cash deal, and even more recently, to acquire AOL from Yahoo. (Disclosure: both AOL and Yahoo are former owners of TechCrunch, in which Yahoo retains a small interest.) 

According to Bending Spoons, the acquisitions of AOL and Vimeo are expected to close by the end of the year, subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including, in the case of Vimeo, approval by its stockholders. 

As of the end of October 2025, Bending Spoons is one of Europe's rare tech decacorns (companies valued at more than $10 billion). The startup last raised at a $2.8 billion valuation in 2024, making its newest latest round a significant step up.

Though long bootstrapped, Bending Spoons had previously raised equity financing several times, including in September 2022 and early 2024. It also has VIPs on its cap table, including tennis and entertainment stars Andre Agassi and Bradley Cooper; tech industry bigs Eric Schmidt, Mike Krieger, and Xavier Niel; and performers The Weeknd, The Chainsmokers, and Maluma.

According to Bending Spoons, its new funding will support future acquisitions and investment in its proprietary technology and AI capabilities. This comes in addition to the $2.8 billion in debt financing the company disclosed as it announced its intention to acquire AOL, debt that will fund the AOL deal and future acquisitions.

Bending Spoons says it intends to continue pursuing new acquisitions that expand its portfolio of consumer and enterprise digital products, and it now has funding to afford more prominent targets going forward. 

AOL and Vimeo already carry far more name recognition than earlier targets, even if deal terms remain undisclosed. The properties also have some reach. In announcing the AOL deal, Bending Spoons claimed that AOL remains one of the top 10 most-used email providers in the world, with 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users. (Not long before acquiring AOL, Bending Spoons was also rumored to be eyeing app maker Elysium and Typeform, the Barcelona-based SaaS company known for its form creation tools.)

Presumably to support its continued efforts to acquire companies, it also has openings across various roles, with new hires initially working from its Milan headquarters before gaining the option to work from offices in London, Madrid, and Warsaw, or remotely. 

In fact, despite warning candidates that Bending Spoons is a “demanding environment,” the company has said it already received more than 600,000 job applications in 2025, a figure that will likely climb as its recent deals generate additional attention.

If you incentivize researchers to publish papers, individuals will find ways to game the system, meeting the minimum quality bar, while taking the least effort to create the most papers and thereby receive the greatest reward.Similarly, if you reward content creators based on views, you will get view maximization behaviors.  If you reward ad placement based on impressions, you will see gaming for impressions.Bad metrics or bad rewards cause bad behavior.We see this over and over because the reward issuers are designing systems to optimize for their upstream metrics.Put differently, the online world is optimized for algorithms, not humans.

Not as gate-keepy as journals and not as anarchic as purely open publishing. Should be cheap, too.

Fundamentally, we want research that offers something new (“what did we learn?”) and presents it in a way that at least plausibly has a chance of becoming generalizable knowledge. You call it gate-keeping, but I call it keeping published science high-quality.

And to bring this back to the original arxiv topic. I think reputation system is going to face problems with some people outside CS lack of enough technical abilities. It also introduce biases in that you would endorse people who you like for other reasons. Actually some of the problems are solved and you would need careful proposal. But the change for publishing scheme needs push from institutions and funding agencies. Authors don't oppose changes but you have a lobby of the parasitic publishing cartel that will oppose these changes.

Asking for a small amount of money would probably help.
Issue with requiring peer reviewed journals or conferences is the severe lag, takes a long time and part of the advantage of arxiv was that you could have the paper instantly as a preprint.
Also these conferences and journals are also receiving enormous quantities of submissions (29.000 for AAAI) so we are just pushing the problem.

That's without even being able to backprop through the annotator, and also with me actively trying to avoid reward hacking. If arxiv used an open model for review, it would be trivial for people to insert a few grammatical mistakes which cause them to receive max points.

1. Require LLM produced papers to be attributed to the relevant LLM and not the person who wrote the prompt.2. Treat submissions that misrepresent authorship as plagiarism.  Remove the article, but leave an entry for it so that there is a clear indication that the author engaged in an act of plagiarism.Review papers are valuable.  Writing one is a great way to gain, or deepen, mastery over a field.  It forces you to branch out and fully assimilate papers that you may have only skimmed, and then place them in their proper context.  Reading quality review papers is also valuable.  They're a great way for people new to a field to get up to speed and they can bring things that were missed to the fore, even for veterans of the field.While the current generation of AI does a poor job of judging significance and highlighting what is actually important, they could improve in the future.  However, there's no need for arXiv to accept hundreds of review papers written by the same model on the same field, and readers certainly don't want to sift through them all.Clearly marking AI submissions and removing credit from the prompters would adequately future-proof things for when, and if, AI can produce high quality review papers.  Clearly marking authors who engage in plagiarism as plagiarists will, hopefully, remove most of the motivation to spam arXiv with AI slop that is misrepresented as the work of humans.My only concern would be for the cost to arXiv of dealing with the inevitable lawsuits.  The policy arXiv has chosen is worse for science, but is less likely to get them sued by butt-hurt plagiarists or the very occasional false positive.

The problem is you can't. Not without careful review of the output. (Certainly not if you're writing about anything remotely novel and thus useful.)But not everyone knows that, which turns private ignorance into a public review problem.

I have to agree with their justification. Since ""Attention Is All You Need"" (2017) I have seen maybe four papers with similar impact in the AI/ML space. The signal to noise ratio is really awful. If I had to pick a semi-related paper published since 2020 that I actually found interesting, it would have to be this one: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19108  I cannot think of a close second right now.All of the machine learning papers are pure slop to me now. The last one I looked at had an abstract that was so long it put me to sleep. Many of these papers aren't attempting basic decorum anymore. Mandatory peer review would fix a lot of this. I don't think it is acceptable for the staff at arXiv to have to endure a Sisyphean mountain of LLM shit. They definitely need to push back.

What's the new method?

For example: https://prereview.org/en-usAnecdotally, a lot of researchers will run their paper pdfs through an AI iteration or two during drafting which also (kinda but not really) counts as a self-review. Although that is not comparable to peer review ofc.

Don't understand why it restricted one category when the problem spans multiple categories.

And it's a unequal arms race, in which generating endless slop is way cheaper than storing it, because slop generators are subsidised (by operating at a loss) but arXiv has to pay the full price for their hosting.

Are you saying that there's an automated method for reliably verifying that something was created by an LLM?

No, not really. From the blog post:> In the past few years, arXiv has been flooded with papers. Generative AI / large language models have added to this flood by making papers – especially papers not introducing new research results – fast and easy to write. While categories across arXiv have all seen a major increase in submissions, it's particularly pronounced in arXiv's CS category.

> Fast forward to present day – submissions to arXiv in general have risen dramatically, and we now receive hundreds of review articles every month. The advent of large language models have made this type of content relatively easy to churn out on demand, and the majority of the review articles we receive are little more than annotated bibliographies, with no substantial discussion of open research issues.

They should solve the real problem of obtaining more funding and volunteers so that they can take on the increased volume of submissions. Especially now that AI's here and we can all be 3 times as productive for the same effort.

Huh, I guess it's only a subset of papers, not all of them. My brain doesn't work that way, because I don't like assigning custom rules for special cases (edit: because I usually view that as a form of discrimination). So sometimes I have a blind spot around the realities of a problem that someone is facing, that don't have much to do with its idealization.What I mean is, I don't know that it's up to arXiv to determine what a ""review article and position paper"" is. Because of that, they must let all papers through, or have all papers face the same review standards.When I see someone getting their fingers into something, like muddying/dithering concepts, shifting focus to something other than the crux of an argument (or using bad faith arguments, etc), I view it as corruption. It's a means for minority forces to insert their will over the majority. In this case, by potentially blocking meaningful work from reaching the public eye on a technicality.So I admit that I was wrong to jump to conclusions. But I don't know that I was wrong in principle or spirit.

Oof. Before this point in the article I wasn't sure if it's fraud, but comparing the money raised for a (failed) alarm clock vs money raised for supposedly-successful ASML competitor was a good of putting things in perspective. And the nuclear fusion thing... oh god.

There are some strange things in this writeup-- I don't think it's clear that the machine they claim to intend to sell is supposed to be a direct writing machine, I assumed it was supposed to be like EUV but with X-rays and some kind of special x-ray tolerant photoresist, but the identity of the founders is at least quite damning, the electrostatic chuck thing might be damning I guess, unless there's some special concern. I assumed that even if it were sensible, it wouldn't work well enough, with damage to the resist or something else that manufacturers would find unacceptable, but this isn't my area, so I can't really judge.

I built an AI system that generates episodic sysadmin stories in the style of BOFH (Bastard Operator From Hell), with a persistent character called ""The Operator"" who maintains voice consistency across episodes.Perfect timing - our featured episode is about a Halloween party in the datacenter where Server Rack #7 achieved sentience at 23:47.

To be clear, this isn't meant to replace or compete with Simon Travaglia's BOFH stories. those are classics and can't be replicated.This is an experiment exploring whether AI can maintain a consistent character voice across episodic content, using BOFH as inspiration for the tone and setting.The current episodes are just the starting point.The plan is to open this up to the community - people can submit episode prompts via pull requests, and collectively influence what gets generated and even influence the character in the future.The AI becomes more of a ""character engine"" that the community directs, rather than autonomous content creation. So the quality and direction should improve as humans decide what stories are worth telling.Right now its admittedly rough, it's a technical proof-of-concept for character consistency as much as anything. But the vision is community-driven storytelling where people have real influence over the content.Which aspects feel boring specifically? Curious what would make it more interesting to you.

In the hyper-capitalist world in which we live, it can often feel like anything and everything is at risk of being monetized. NFTs are just code-designated image files that—for whatever reason—are worth millions of dollars. The sharing economy encourages Americans to make money off the things they already own—their houses and cars. The influencer lifestyle lets people use social media to monetize their daily activities via highly curated posts. Now, the users of various prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi appear to be scraping the bottom of the monetization barrel. The newest way to make money online? Predicting the words a person will say.

Yes, there is apparently a new way to make money online, and it is to accurately predict the words that a person will say during a speech or a live appearance. Bloomberg reports on this terrible/bizzare/hilarious new phenomenon, which it describes as “part of a niche category [of prediction market]” where the “outcome isn't tied to earnings, price moves or sports games, but to what people say in some public forum.”

Bloomberg notes a recent example of this involving Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's CEO. During the company's recent earnings call, Armstrong finished up by uttering a select number of DeFi terms: “I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call,” Armstrong said at the end of the call. “I just want to add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, staking, and Web3 — to make sure we get those in before the end of the call.”

Bloomberg notes that, across various prediction market platforms, approximately $84,000 was bet on whether certain words like “stablecoin,” “margin,” and “institution,” would be spoken during the call.

The U.S. federal government released a preview of what consumers can expect to pay next year if they buy health insurance through Obamacare. And it's not good.

The average amount that health insurers will be charging for coverage at ACA Marketplaces is rising by 26% on average, according to analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Roughly 24 million Americans have Obamacare coverage.

Open enrollment for next year starts Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 15, 2026, but the federal government website Healthcare.gov opened up this week to allow anyone with Obamacare to get a preview of what kind of coverage they can purchase. They call it the “window shopping period.”

The New York Times talked to one 61-year-old woman in Oregon who said that she paid $439 per month in 2025 and checked to see how much she might be paying next year. The newspaper reports that the plan she had will jump to $1,059 and has a deductible of $7,100.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees ACA enrollment and is run by Dr. Mehmet Oz, published a press release Tuesday that tried to downplay higher costs while insisting that many consumers will be able to buy plans at $50 or less per month. Those plans have very high deductibles, of course. Oz suggested during a press conference Wednesday that something illegitimate was happening with many people on Obamacare.

Oz claimed that “half” of people on Obamacare haven't filed a claim all year. “I have to ask myself—you should be as well—if I had insurance, why would I never use it?” Oz said.

“The concern that has been raised is that a large number of the 12 million people who had never used their insurance last year may not legitimately have the insurance, know they have the insurance, want to have the insurance.”

It's unclear what Oz was trying to suggest exactly.

One reason that health insurance costs are expected to soar next year is that federal tax credits will expire unless Congress acts. But nbody expects Congress to act, given the fact that Republicans have refused to negotiate with Democrats on the issue. It's the main sticking point that has kept the government shut down since Oct. 1. Democrats want an expansion of the covid-era credits and Republicans simply refuse to budge, insisting that the credits were intended to be temporary.

Oz, a former TV host known for frequently spreading bullshit, also complained that the government shutdown was keeping staff at his agency from properly addressing “issues,” like why so many people with Obamacare aren't filing claims.

The smart vacuum cleaner was remotely bricked for not collecting data.

An engineer got curious about how his iLife A11 smart vacuum worked and monitored the network traffic coming from the device. That's when he noticed it was constantly sending logs and telemetry data to the manufacturer — something he hadn't consented to. The user, Harishankar, decided to block the telemetry servers' IP addresses on his network, while keeping the firmware and OTA servers open. While his smart gadget worked for a while, it just refused to turn on soon after. After a lengthy investigation, he discovered that a remote kill command had been issued to his device.

He sent it to the service center multiple times, wherein the technicians would turn it on and see nothing wrong with the vacuum. When they returned it to him, it would work for a few days and then fail to boot again. After several rounds of back-and-forth, the service center probably got tired and just stopped accepting it, saying it was out of warranty. Because of this, he decided to disassemble the thing to determine what killed it and to see if he could get it working again.

Since the A11 was a smart device, it had an AllWinner A33 SoC with a TinaLinux operating system, plus a GD32F103 microcontroller to manage its plethora of sensors, including Lidar, gyroscopes, and encoders. He created PCB connectors and wrote Python scripts to control them with a computer, presumably to test each piece individually and identify what went wrong. From there, he built a Raspberry Pi joystick to manually drive the vacuum, proving that there was nothing wrong with the hardware.

 




From this, he looked at its software and operating system, and that's where he discovered the dark truth: his smart vacuum was a security nightmare and a black hole for his personal data. First of all, it's Android Debug Bridge, which gives him full root access to the vacuum, wasn't protected by any kind of password or encryption. The manufacturer added a makeshift security protocol by omitting a crucial file, which caused it to disconnect soon after booting, but Harishankar easily bypassed it. He then discovered that it used Google Cartographer to build a live 3D map of his home.

This isn't unusual, by far. After all, it's a smart vacuum, and it needs that data to navigate around his home. However, the concerning thing is that it was sending off all this data to the manufacturer's server. It makes sense for the device to send this data to the manufacturer, as its onboard SoC is nowhere near powerful enough to process all that data. However, it seems that iLife did not clear this with its customers. Furthermore, the engineer made one disturbing discovery — deep in the logs of his non-functioning smart vacuum, he found a command with a timestamp that matched exactly the time the gadget stopped working. This was clearly a kill command, and after he reversed it and rebooted the appliance, it roared back to life.

 




So, why did the A11 work at the service center but refuse to run in his home? The technicians would reset the firmware on the smart vacuum, thus removing the kill code, and then connect it to an open network, making it run normally. But once it connected again to the network that had its telemetry servers blocked, it was bricked remotely because it couldn't communicate with the manufacturer's servers. Since he blocked the appliance's data collection capabilities, its maker decided to just kill it altogether. ""Someone—or something—had remotely issued a kill command,” says Harishankar. “Whether it was intentional punishment or automated enforcement of 'compliance,' the result was the same: a consumer device had turned on its owner.”

Unfortunately, many other smart vacuum brands use similar hardware, so it's not far-fetched to think that they have the same setup. This is likely especially true for cheaper devices that have less capable hardware and aren't capable of edge computing, meaning they'll have to send the data to some faraway server for processing. But because your information is being offboarded to another device outside of your control, you really have no idea what's happening to it, giving the manufacturer free rein to use it as it pleases.

In the end, the owner was able to run his vacuum fully locally without manufacturer control after all the tweaks he made. This helped him retake control of his data and make use of his $300 software-bricked smart device on his own terms. As for the rest of us who don't have the technical knowledge and time to follow his accomplishments, his advice is to “Never use your primary WiFi network for IoT devices” and to “Treat them as strangers in your home.”

AMD Zen 5 vs Raptor Lake Clash!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Intel Core i9-14900K might be a generation old at this point, but surprisingly, it is still the fastest gaming CPU that Intel currently has to offer. With that title in its possession, the Core i9-14900K is definitely the CPU that Intel would want to pit against AMD's cache-laden Zen 5 processors.

Among AMD's latest and greatest is the Ryzen 9 9900X3D, the closest competitor to the Core i9-14900K in terms of pricing. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D is built on the latest Zen 5 architecture, but wields the power of AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, an ace that has proven very beneficial for AMD in the gaming division recently.

While it may not make much sense to put one of AMD's latest flagships against the dated Core i9-14900K at first glance, this is certainly the comparison that gives Intel its best shot at dethroning AMD in this market segment.

We will put the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D vs Intel Core i9-14900K CPUs through a rigorous six-round gauntlet to determine which CPU is truly the best in its class, and which one you should spend your money on.

The architectural differences between these processors are immediately apparent in their core layouts and thread configurations. The Intel Core i9-14900K employs the Raptor Lake hybrid architecture featuring 24 cores distributed across eight Performance cores (P-cores) based on the Raptor Cove microarchitecture and sixteen Efficiency cores (E-cores) with the Gracemont design.

This configuration supports 32 threads through Intel's Hyperthreading technology, with P-cores operating at base frequencies of 3.2 GHz and boosting up to 6.0 GHz, while E-cores run at 2.4 GHz base and 4.4 GHz boost.

In contrast, the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D features a more traditional homogeneous design with 12 cores and 24 threads, all built on the advanced Zen 5 architecture. Operating at a higher base frequency of 4.4 GHz with boost capabilities reaching 5.5 GHz, the 9900X3D emphasizes consistent per-core performance rather than Intel's heterogeneous approach.

AMD's Ryzen 9 9900X3D is manufactured using TSMC's cutting-edge 4nm process node, while Intel's Core i9-14900K, conversely, utilizes Intel's proprietary ""Intel 7"" process.

Perhaps the most distinctive specification difference lies in the cache architectures, where AMD's 3D V-Cache technology creates a substantial advantage in cache capacity. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D incorporates AMD's second-generation 3D V-Cache technology, providing a massive 128 MB of L3 cache through vertical stacking of cache dies. This extra cache boosts gaming performance tremendously.

Intel's i9-14900K features a more conventional 36 MB of L3 cache combined with 32 MB of L2 cache. While respectable, this pales in comparison to AMD's cache implementation.

Both processors support modern DDR5 memory standards, though their implementations and platform integrations differ in scope and capability. The Intel Core i9-14900K supports both DDR5-5600 and DDR4-3200 memory configurations, which makes it quite versatile.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D also supports DDR5-5600 memory with a maximum capacity of 192 GB, but it focuses exclusively on DDR5. AMD's approach includes 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes directly from the processor, while Intel only offers 20 PCIe 5.0 lanes directly from the CPU.

For power, Intel's Core i9-14900K specifies a base TDP of 125W but can ramp up to 253W under maximum turbo conditions, while its AMD competitor stays relatively conservative with a TDP of 120W, thanks to its smaller process node.

⭐ Winner: AMD

While it is hard to declare a winner by simply looking at specs on a sheet of paper, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D does look more impressive in this round simply because of the ace up its sleeve: AMD's 3D V-Cache. Intel doesn't have anything in its arsenal to match that, at least on paper.

This particular section of the faceoff will focus on the gaming performance of the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and the Core i9-14900K across a variety of games at 1080p. We chose the 1080p resolution in order to minimize the GPU limitations and to maximize the difference in framerates between the various CPUs.

We also chose the formidable RTX 5090 for testing to remove any GPU bottlenecks. You can also check out our in-depth reviews of the two CPUs (linked above) for a more comprehensive analysis.

According to our test results, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D demonstrates a clear advantage in raw gaming performance over the Core i9-14900K.

In the 16-game geometric mean, the 9900X3D achieves a 17.7% lead in average FPS and a 12.6% improvement in 1% lows over the Core i9-14900K.

Of course, this disparity stems primarily from AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which drastically reduces latency in cache-sensitive games, allowing the CPU to feed the GPU more efficiently at 1080p.

The picture becomes even clearer when we look at the individual games. In Baldur's Gate 3 (DX11), the 9900X3D displays a dominant 34% lead over the 14900K. Similarly, Hitman 3 reveals a massive 35% advantage in average FPS. Even in GPU-bound titles like Cyberpunk 2077, the 9900X3D maintains a 9.7% edge in average FPS over its Intel competitor.

Furthermore, the 9900X3D's superiority in 1% lows is critical for stutter-free gameplay. In The Last of Us Part 1, we found the Ryzen 9 9900X3D to be 3.5% faster in 1% lows, reducing hitches during intense scenes; meanwhile, in other games like Cyberpunk 2077, the 1% lows are more or less evenly matched.

The frametime advantage arises from the 3D V-Cache's ability to minimize frametime spikes by keeping frequently accessed game assets readily available, whereas the 14900K relies on higher clock speeds and DDR5 bandwidth, which struggle under complex, erratic workloads.

The 9900X3D is significantly more efficient during gaming, consuming 113W on average versus the 14900K's 130.2W. This results in a 36% higher efficiency rating, as shown by our FPS/W graph. AMD's chiplet design and TSMC's 5nm process allow the X3D to deliver higher performance at lower voltages, while Intel's higher power draw reflects its push for peak frequencies and use of an older process node.

Due to its higher sticker price, the 9900X3D's value-per-dollar trails the 14900K (0.42 FPS/$ vs. 0.37 FPS/$). Intel's aggressive pricing gives it a 23% value edge in raw FPS per dollar. However, this metric overlooks platform costs and focuses solely on the CPU price relative to raw gaming performance. We will explore the value conversation a bit deeper later in the article.

Putting it all together, it is clear that the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the superior gaming CPU, offering ~18% higher average FPS and ~13% smoother 1% lows than the Core i9-14900K, while delivering 36% better efficiency during gaming. It excels in cache-dependent titles and maintains leads even in GPU-bound scenarios.

It trails the Core i9-14900K in FPS-per-dollar in gaming, but that metric doesn't tell the whole story. Nevertheless, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D takes this round comfortably.

⭐ Winner: AMD

While the 14900K wins on pure FPS-per-dollar and suits users taking a multifunctional approach, those seeking uncompromising gaming performance should choose the Ryzen 9 9900X3D.

We can see that the 14900K takes a lead that is particularly pronounced in heavily multi-threaded tasks, where Intel's higher core/thread count and peak clock speeds often outweigh the benefits of AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, designed primarily for gaming latency reduction.

In multi-threaded productivity, the i9-14900K demonstrates a significant overall edge. Our comprehensive multi-threaded performance ranking geomean places the Core i9-14900K at 547 points, compared to the Ryzen 9 9900X3D's 499 points, giving Intel a 9.6% performance advantage.

This gap is reflected across key individual benchmarks. In Cinebench 2024 multi-core, the 14900K leads the Ryzen 9 9900X3D by a substantial 17.5%. The difference is even more dramatic in rendering, where POV-Ray multi-core shows the 14900K delivering 28% more performance than the AMD CPU.

Similarly, Blender Classroom performance shows the Intel chip outpaces the AMD part by around 7%, while HandBrake x265 encoding sees a narrower but still present 1.1% Intel lead.

Even though the gap narrows, the i9-14900K generally maintains a lead in single-threaded productivity as well. Our single-threaded performance ranking geomean places the 14900K at 266 points and the 9900X3D at 251 points, giving Intel a 6% advantage.

Looking at individual tests, Cinebench 2024 single-core results show the 14900K maintaining a smaller but consistent 1.6% lead over the 9900X3D. Web browsing performance in WebXPRT4 flips the scales in favor of AMD, with a slightly noticeable 2.1% deficit for Intel in this lighter workload.

It is interesting to see that both CPUs are almost at parity in single-threaded workloads, but Intel pulls away significantly in multi-threaded performance. The primary benefit of AMD's innovative 3D V-Cache lies in gaming, not the diverse productivity tasks measured here.

Based on our thorough testing and benchmark results, the Intel Core i9-14900K is definitely the superior productivity CPU compared to the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D. It delivers faster performance across the vast majority of tested productivity benchmarks, particularly in demanding multi-threaded applications where advantages frequently reach double-digit percentages.

While the single-threaded gap is narrower, Intel still holds the edge. Combined with its significantly lower price point, the Core i9-14900K also presents a much stronger value proposition for users prioritizing productivity performance.

The 9900X3D's strengths clearly lie elsewhere, primarily in gaming scenarios that heavily leverage its large L3 cache.

⭐ Winner: Intel

The Ryzen 9 9900X3D's massive L3 cache fails to make much of a difference in productivity work, as Intel obliterates the competition with its superior core count and multi-threaded performance.

The Intel Core i9-14900K delivers exceptional overclocking capabilities with full unlocked multiplier support and comprehensive voltage controls. Intel provides sophisticated overclocking tools, including the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU), which offers AI-assisted overclocking that adapts to individual systems and recommends optimal settings.

The processor supports manual frequency adjustments, voltage tweaking, and per-core ratio controls, allowing enthusiasts to easily push performance cores. Intel's approach includes advanced voltage offset capabilities through V/F curve manipulation, enabling both positive offsets for higher frequencies and negative offsets for better thermal management.

Meanwhile, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D represents a groundbreaking shift in AMD's X3D overclocking philosophy. Unlike previous generations, where X3D processors had severely restricted overclocking due to the voltage sensitivity of the 3D V-Cache, the 9900X3D features full overclocking support with unlocked multipliers.

AMD achieved this breakthrough by repositioning the 3D V-Cache underneath the CPU cores rather than on top, significantly improving thermal management. However, the X3D architecture still presents thermal challenges for hardcore overclockers, with users reporting more aggressive thermal throttling and difficulty maintaining high all-core frequencies compared to traditional Ryzen processors.

The processor supports manual frequency adjustments, voltage controls, comprehensive PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) for automatically boosting power limits, and Curve Optimizer for undervolting tuning. Users can achieve performance gains through both automatic and manual tuning; however, these gains can be comparatively limited because aggressive out-of-the-box tuning delivers the lion's share of performance at stock settings.

The X3D processors deliver outstanding gaming performance thanks to 3D V-Cache, but this tech also limits the upside of conventional memory overclocking, particularly when using EXPO profiles. We've found sub-2% performance gains from memory tuning with the 9800X3D, which, from a pricing standpoint, is great for enthusiasts; you can buy a cheap memory kit and get nearly the full performance potential. However, this is also a letdown for manual tuning enthusiasts, as the potential upside of tuning is severely limited.

For enthusiasts prioritizing maximum manual overclocking flexibility and extreme overclocking potential, the Intel Core i9-14900K is the ideal choice. Intel's mature overclocking ecosystem, comprehensive software tools, extensive voltage controls, and proven ability to achieve extreme frequencies make it the preferred platform for serious overclockers.

While the AMD 9900X3D offers impressive gaming performance and newfound overclocking support, its thermal limitations and cache-related constraints make it less suitable for users who want to push absolute performance boundaries through manual tuning.

⭐Winner: Intel

The Intel platform's superior thermal scaling with exotic cooling and more predictable overclocking behavior ultimately makes it the better choice for dedicated overclocking enthusiasts. It also offers much more meaningful memory overclocking headroom.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D's automated boost algorithms deliver nearly peak performance right out of the box, eliminating the need for manual adjustments. The automated PBO feature, paired with undervolting, can provide a simple pathway to performance gains; however, these gains are limited. Additionally, memory tuning yields comparatively smaller gains than with traditional processors, due to the 3D V-Cache's improvements in memory access.

Based on our test results, the power consumption profiles of the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Core i9-14900K reveal fundamentally different design philosophies, with significant implications for efficiency and cooling requirements.

Intel holds a slight edge in idle states. The 14900K consumes 26W at full idle, compared to the 9900X3D's 23W, resulting in a 15% difference. During active light workloads, such as YouTube playback, the gap narrows to 10% but still persists. This suggests Intel's hybrid architecture manages low-power states marginally better.

Under sustained AVX loads, the divergence is stark, providing a more nuanced picture. In Prime95 Small FFTs test (a worst-case power virus), the 9900X3D averages 162W, while the 14900K draws a massive 359W. This represents a massive 121% increase for Intel.

Similarly, in the y-cruncher AVX test, the 9900X3D consumes 117% less power than the Intel CPU. Even in a more realistic multi-core rendering test like Cinebench 2024, the 14900K consumes 92% more power than the 9900X3D. This immense power draw by Intel is driven by its aggressive boost algorithms, pushing high core counts and clock speeds.

AMD's 3D V-Cache technology and optimized TSMC node deliver superior efficiency in our benchmarks. In HandBrake x265 encoding, the 9900X3D achieves 6.41 Watts per fps, vastly outperforming the 14900K's score with 84% better efficiency. This advantage persists in Cinebench 2024, where the 9900X3D delivers 65% better efficiency.

The ""Estimated Task Energy"" chart visually confirms this, placing the 9900X3D significantly lower on the Y-axis (lower energy per task) than Intel's 14th-gen parts. In the Handbrake x265 scatter plot, the Core i9-14900K delivers roughly the same FPS as the 9900X3D while consuming almost double the task energy.

The 14900K's extreme power draw, averaging around 330W-360W under load, necessitates robust cooling. High-end 360mm liquid coolers or premium air coolers are essential to prevent thermal throttling and to manage noise. Even custom liquid cooling loops should be considered by those users who can afford and maintain them.

In contrast, the 9900X3D's peak power draw was found to be between 170W-200W across our benchmarks, which is far more manageable. A high-quality dual-tower air cooler or 240mm AIO is sufficient, reducing system cost, complexity, and noise. Intel's power spikes also create greater thermal management challenges for motherboard VRMs and case airflow.

At the end of the day, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is decisively more power-efficient under heavy workloads, consuming roughly half the power of the 14900K in demanding AVX tasks while delivering competitive performance.

While Intel holds a minor idle advantage, AMD's dramatically lower load power consumption translates directly to easier cooling requirements and lower operational costs.

⭐ Winner: AMD

If you want efficiency, quieter operation, or simpler thermal solutions, the 9900X3D is the better choice. The 14900K's superior performance in productivity work comes at a steep cost: an immense power draw and challenging cooling demands.

When comparing the price of the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D ($565) versus the Intel Core i9-14900K ($450), the total cost extends well beyond the CPU price difference. A true cost comparison encompasses the entire platform, including the motherboard, RAM, and CPU cooler.

For the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D, you'll need a motherboard with an AM5 socket —the latest AMD platform. These motherboards start at approximately $125 for basic B650 models, though quality options typically begin around $150-200, and premium X-series options can reach around $500.

On the Intel side, the Core i9-14900K uses the LGA 1700 socket, which has been around longer, making motherboards more affordable and widely available. A mid-range Z-series motherboard, suitable for the 14900K, can be found for $130 to $250. Premium Z790 motherboards can exceed $400-600 for flagship models.

As for RAM, both CPUs support DDR5, which is the modern standard for high-performance systems, though the Intel chip also supports DDR4. To keep performance comparable and align with enthusiast expectations, DDR5 is the way to go for both platforms. A 32GB DDR5 kit (2x16GB), running at speeds like 6000MT/s, typically costs between $100 and $150.

Cooling represents a crucial cost consideration where these two platforms diverge significantly. The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D's 120W TDP and peak power consumption around 160-180W make it relatively manageable with quality air cooling or mid-range AIO solutions. Suitable air coolers range from $40 to $100, while 240mm AIO liquid coolers cost $70 to $120.

The Intel Core i9-14900K presents substantially higher cooling demands due to its 253W maximum turbo power, which can reach nearly 380W under demanding workloads. This necessitates premium cooling solutions, with recommended air coolers starting around $80-130 and AIO liquid coolers preferring 280mm-360mm radiators costing $120-200

For pure upfront cost, particularly if utilizing DDR4 memory, the Intel Core i9-14900K platform offers significantly better value. The $115 CPU price advantage, combined with potentially cheaper motherboards and the DDR4 option, can result in total system savings easily exceeding $100-$250+ compared to a comparable build using the 9900X3D.

Even though the AM5 platform is more future-proof, the AMD chip's price premium and mandatory DDR5/AM5 costs are hard to overcome on the pricing front unless its unique gaming advantage is the absolute top priority.

⭐ Winner: Intel

When looking at the savings with the Core i9-14900K, the AMD CPU's higher upfront cost is hard to justify unless you absolutely need to have the highest framerates possible in every scenario.

After a heated six-round gauntlet, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and the Core i9-14900K end up in a 3-3 tie, just another example of the fierce competition we have seen between the two companies over the past few years. However, as we often see with AMD's gaming-optimized X3D chips versus conventional CPUs that lack the innovative 3D V-Cache, the difference often boils down to your priorities.

The 9900X3D leverages its revolutionary 3D V-Cache to secure wins in gaming performance, and the TSMC node and chiplet design help in peak power consumption rounds, offering a cooler, quieter, and just plain better gaming experience.

Meanwhile, the Core i9-14900K flexes Intel's raw frequency prowess and core muscle, taking leads in productivity performance and overclocking headroom, while also undercutting its rival on purchase price.

This tie forces the decision firmly onto the user's specific priorities and use cases. For the gaming purist or the efficiency-conscious builder, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is the standout choice. Its massive cache delivers exceptional frame rates in gaming, and its significantly lower power draw translates to easier cooling and quieter operation.

For the multi-threaded workload warrior or the seasoned overclocker seeking maximum tunable frequency, the Core i9-14900K holds the advantage. Its higher peak clocks and proven overclocking potential extract formidable productivity throughput gains from tuning, and its lower initial price point frees up budget for other components.

At the end of the day, there is no single ""best"" CPU here, only the best CPU for you. If your rig is focused on just gaming and you value power efficiency, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is your champion. If you regularly run heavily threaded applications alongside gaming and want to save a few bucks, the Core i9-14900K delivers exceptional value and raw power.

Both are phenomenal processors, but your workflow and priorities will dictate the true winner for your build.

⭐ Winner: Tie

This corporate drama seems to be driven by the U.S.-China trade war.

Beijing has just allowed companies to apply for exemptions from its Nexperia export ban, allowing those relying on its chips to resume orders finally. China previously banned exports from the company's local subsidiary about a couple of weeks ago, in response to the Dutch government seizing control of the chipmaker from its Chinese parent, Wingtech. According to the South China Morning Post, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) will consider exemptions as automakers worldwide experience disruptions.

Although Nexperia isn't as big as TSMC or Samsung, it's a niche supplier of automotive semiconductors, holding about 40% of the market. With the average modern car containing about 1,500 chips, supply chain instability can stall production and cause assembly lines halfway across the world to cease operation.

“We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,” a MOFCOM representative said in a statement, meaning Beijing isn't lifting the blanket ban on Nexperia China's exports. Instead, car manufacturers must seek a waiver from the Chinese government, which will consider applications on a case-by-case basis.

This statement comes soon after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on the sidelines of the 2025 APEC Summit. MOFCOM said that the White House would postpone its 50-percent subsidiary rule, which says that companies that are at least 50% owned by blacklisted entities would be included in its export ban. Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's parent company since 2019, was included in the list late last year, meaning Nexperia is in danger of losing access to U.S.-made components, software, and technologies.

Washington introduced this rule in late September, which came into effect immediately. However, companies were granted a Temporary General License, effective for 60 days after the expansion of the ban, to allow them to adjust their supply chains. Although the Dutch government says its CEO's alleged financial misappropriation partly drives its takeover of Nexperia, the timing of the move suggests it is a response to the threat posed by the U.S.'s expanded export controls.

China's move would allow companies to resume deliveries of Nexperia chips if they can obtain a license from Beijing. However, it looks like the company's ownership saga will not end here, as the Dutch head office has ceased exports to its China factory. Although Nexperia has factories in other locations outside of China, 70% of its global output comes from its site in Guangdong. This adds a further complication to the ongoing spat, because even though Nexperia China can now continue deliveries to its clients who acquire a permit from the MOFCOM, it wouldn't be able to keep up with demand unless its European headquarters resume shipments of the raw materials needed to continue production.

Windows 10 isn't listed, but it's not abandoned

AMD's latest Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 driver release has caused quite a stir among users, but the company has now issued important clarifications. While the update moves Radeon RX 5000 (RDNA 1) and RX 6000 (RDNA 2) graphics cards into ""maintenance mode"", AMD has confirmed that these GPUs, along with discrete and handheld devices based on the same architectures, will continue to receive day-zero game support and essential driver updates. There was also certain confusion around support for Windows 10, as the release notes only mentioned Windows 11. However, it has since been clarified that Windows 10 remains fully supported despite its end of life.

As first spotted by Windows Latest, the release notes for Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 only mention support for Windows 11 version 21H2, with no reference to Windows 10. This initially led to speculation that AMD had dropped official support for Microsoft's older operating system. However, the company has confirmed in a statement that this isn't the case.

According to AMD, Windows 10 will still receive full driver support, including the latest Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 release. The absence of Windows 10 in the documentation is due to Microsoft's operating system reaching its end of support on October 14, 2025. As a result, AMD no longer lists it explicitly in the driver release notes, but the software and drivers remain compatible and supported.

“To clarify, the new driver doesn't claim Windows 10 support because Windows 10 is in the End of Life stage as per Microsoft,” an AMD spokesperson explained. “The AMD Software: Adrenalin package, although it does not specifically call out Windows 10 support, supports Windows 10. Windows 10 support will continue to be available in AMD Software Adrenalin Edition via the Windows 11 installer.”

AMD's continued support gives Windows 10 users a bit more breathing room before they decide to make the switch. The clarification definitely comes as great news for PC users who are still stuck on Windows 10, especially those who haven't yet jumped to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations or personal preference. If you're still using Windows 10 and want to keep your PC running smoothly, there's no immediate need to rush the transition, especially if you have an AMD graphics card or integrated GPU solution.

For those who are considering how to upgrade to Windows 11, we've covered how to install Windows 11 with a TPM workaround for unsupported PCs, as well as how to get Windows 11 for free or cheap if you're building or refreshing a system.

A University of Minnesota Medical School research team, led by Ziad Nahas, MD, has been awarded a $4.4 million grant for a first-in-the-world study of prefrontal cortical stimulation in severe bipolar disorder.

The funding, from Breakthrough Discoveries for thriving with Bipolar Disorder (BD²), will be used to explore how large-scale brain networks regulate mood in bipolar disorder, and how pushing and pulling these networks may contribute to the shifts between depression and mania. 

The research will specifically test a novel type of brain stimulation - known as Personalized and Adaptive Cortico Electrostimulation (PACE) - shown to treat depressive symptoms. By doing so, the team also aims to identify the underlying mechanisms of mood switching in bipolar disorder and use optimal tuning of stimulation parameters to relieve symptoms.

The University of Minnesota is uniquely positioned to undertake this complex and cutting-edge proposal. A better understanding of what the neurobiological systems that govern bipolar disorder are and how to best modulate them will undoubtedly lead to better treatment options for a very debilitating and often deadly psychiatric illness.""

Dr. Ziad Nahas, MD, psychiatrist with M Health Fairview

The third round of BD² Discovery Research grants were awarded to four teams across the country - all aimed at examining the key mechanisms of bipolar disorder.

The University of Minnesota study aims to begin enrollment in 2026. More information on studies at the Interventional Psychiatry Research Lab can be found at [email protected].

New research led by the University of Minnesota Medical School demonstrates that molecules acting as ""molecular bumpers"" and ""molecular glues"" can rewire G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, turning the cell's busiest receptors into precision tools - opening the door to a new generation of safer, smarter medicines. The findings were published today in Nature.

About one-third of all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration target the GPCR family. Although they are the largest family of successful drug targets, scientists recognize that these receptors still hold untapped potential as targets for new treatments. These receptors can activate a plethora of signaling pathways downstream of 16 different G proteins, resulting in different cellular and physiological effects. Some of these pathways may be therapeutically useful, while others lead to unwanted side effects, limiting the potential for therapeutic development.

The capability to design drugs that produce only selected signaling outcomes may yield safer, more effective medicines. Until now, it hasn't been obvious how to do this.""

Lauren Slosky, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School, and the senior and corresponding author of the study

In this study, the research team, including chemists at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP), describe a strategy to design compounds that selectively activate a subset of the receptor's normal signaling pathways. Nearly all other GPCR-based drugs target the receptor from outside the cell. These new compounds bind a previously undrugged site on the inside of the cell. Here, they directly interact with signaling partners

In their study of the neurotensin receptor 1, a type of GPCR, the research team found that compounds binding this intracellular receptor site can act as molecular glues - promoting interactions with some signaling partners - and as molecular bumpers, preventing interactions with other signaling partners. 

""Most drugs 'turn up' or 'turn down' all of a receptor's signaling uniformly,"" Dr. Slosky said. ""In addition to 'volume control,' these new compounds change the message received by the cell."" 

Using modeling, they designed new compounds with diverse signaling profiles, leading to different biological effects. 

""We controlled which signaling pathways were turned on and which ones were turned off by changing the chemical structure of the compound,"" said Steven Olson, PhD, the executive director of Medicinal Chemistry at SBP and study co-author. ""Most importantly, these changes were predictable and can be used by medicinal chemists to rationally design new drugs."" 

For the neurotensin receptor 1, the ultimate goal is to discover treatments for chronic pain and addiction that minimize side effects. Because this intracellular site is common to the GPCR superfamily, this strategy is likely transferrable to many receptors and may lead to novel treatments for a wide array of diseases. 

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Department of Defense, University of Minnesota Foundation, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development and Japan Science and Technology Agency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Dysfunction in chromosome-stabilizing protein identified as a cause of deadly illnesses","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251031/Dysfunction-in-chromosome-stabilizing-protein-identified-as-a-cause-of-deadly-illnesses.aspx","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:22:00 GMT","

New research from the University of Wisconsin–Madison reveals that dysfunction in a protein essential to maintaining stability in our chromosomes may be responsible for serious - and sometimes deadly - diseases.

Their findings, published today in Science, could provide patients and their doctors with new protein mutations to test for certain cancers and bone marrow diseases.

Our chromosomes (bundles of proteins and DNA that store all our genetic information), are protected from degradation by telomeres - the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes made from repetitive DNA sequences and proteins. While telomeres naturally shorten as we age, dysfunction in telomere formation and maintenance can make DNA less stable, leading to premature aging and other diseases.

Scientists in the laboratory of Ci Ji Lim, a UW–Madison professor of biochemistry, in collaboration with researchers in the university's Department of Chemistry, were interested in identifying proteins that interact with an enzyme called telomerase, which is responsible for maintaining telomeres. Malfunctions in these proteins could be the cause of some diseases resulting from shortened telomeres.

""This line of research goes beyond a biochemical understanding of a molecular process. It deepens clinical understanding of telomere diseases,"" says Lim, whose work is supported by the National Institutes of Health.

The researchers, led by graduate student Sourav Agrawal, research scientist Xiuhua Lin, and postdoctoral researcher Vivek Susvirkar, searched for proteins likely to interact with telomerase using AlphaFold, a machine learning tool that predicts the 3D structure of proteins and protein-protein interactions. They found that a molecule called replication protein A (RPA) plays an essential role in maintaining telomeres by stimulating telomerase. RPA's role in DNA replication and repair has long been understood, but its role in maintaining long, healthy telomeres in humans was previously unconfirmed. Guided by their findings from AlphaFold, the team experimentally validated that, in humans, RPA is required to stimulate telomerase and help maintain telomeres.

Their findings, Lim says, have immediate implications for some patients with often fatal illnesses resulting from shortened telomeres, including aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.

""There are some patients with shortened telomere disorders that couldn't be explained with our previous body of knowledge,"" explains Lim. ""Now we have an answer to the underlying cause of some of these short telomere disease mutations: it is a result of RPA not being able to stimulate telomerase.""

Lim and his team have received inquiries from clinicians and scientists around the world asking if their patients' diseases could be the result of genetic mutations inhibiting RPA's newfound function.

There are colleagues reaching out from France, Israel, and Australia. They just want to give a cause for their patient's short telomere disease so that the patients and their families can understand what is happening and why. With biochemical analysis, we can test their patients' mutation to see if it impacts how RPA interacts with telomerase, and give the doctors insights into possible causes of their patients' diseases.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Columbia researchers report first successful pregnancy using AI-guided sperm recovery method","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251031/Columbia-researchers-report-first-successful-pregnancy-using-AI-guided-sperm-recovery-method.aspx","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:51:00 GMT","

Researchers at the Columbia University Fertility Center reported the first successful pregnancy using an AI-guided method they developed to recover sperm in men with azoospermia, in which ejaculate contains little or no sperm. 

The case is described in a research letter published in The Lancet. 

Male factors account for approximately 40% of couples with infertility. Of those, about 10-15% of men with infertility have azoospermia. 

A semen sample can appear totally normal, but when you look under the microscope you discover just a sea of cellular debris, with no sperm visible. Many couples with male-factor infertility are told they have little chance of having a biological child."" 

 Zev Williams, senior author of the paper and Director of the Columbia University Fertility Center

Men with azoospermia may undergo a procedure to have sperm surgically extracted from the testes, but the procedure is often unsuccessful and can cause vascular problems, inflammation, or a temporary decrease in testosterone levels.   

A few specialized labs employ technicians to manually inspect semen samples - a lengthy and expensive process - after they have been processed with a centrifuge or other agents that can damage sperm. 

""The field has really been challenged to find a better way to identify and retrieve viable sperm cells in men with exceedingly low sperm counts,"" Williams says. 

Williams assembled a team of researchers and clinicians to develop a new method that combines a variety of technologies to identify and retrieve rare sperm cells from men with azoospermia. 

""Our team included experts in advanced imaging techniques, microfluidics, and reproductive endocrinology to tackle each individual step required to find and isolate rare sperm,"" says Hemant Suryawanshi, an assistant professor of reproductive sciences at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and project leader. 

The STAR (Sperm Tracking and Recovery) method, unveiled earlier this year, employs high-powered imaging technology to scan through a semen sample from men with azoospermia, taking over 8 million images in under an hour. AI is used to identify sperm cells in the sample, and a microfluidic chip with tiny, hair-like channels isolates the portion of the semen sample containing the sperm cell. Within milliseconds, a robot gently removes the sperm cell so that it can be used to create an embryo or frozen and stored for future use. 

STAR was tested in a patient that had been trying to start a family for nearly 20 years, including multiple IVF cycles at other centers, several manual sperm searches, and two surgical procedures to extract sperm.

The patient provided a 3.5 mL semen sample. In about two hours, STAR scanned 2.5 million images, identifying 2 viable sperm cells, which were then used to create two embryos and start a pregnancy.

The findings, though based on one case, show the feasibility of this technology to overcome long-standing barriers in helping men with azoospermia. 

""You only need one healthy sperm to create an embryo,"" Williams says. 

Larger clinical studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of STAR in broader patient populations.

Delirium, commonly observed in critically ill patients following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), is an acute neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. The underlying brain network mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the functional connectivity (FC) of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in delirium patients with basal ganglia ICH and to identify potential biomarkers for predicting delirium onset.

In this cross-sectional study, brain networkomics techniques were used to examine the FC within the ARAS in ICH patients with and without delirium. A two-sample t-test compared differences in ARAS connectivity between delirium and non-delirium groups, identifying abnormal brain regions and their corresponding FC values. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was then performed to evaluate the predictive value of FC for delirium onset.

A significant disruption in FC between the brainstem ARAS nuclei and the left parahippocampal gyrus was observed in ICH patients with delirium. The FC strength between these regions was a reliable predictor of delirium occurrence, with an area under the curve of 0.893, indicating high predictive accuracy.

Disruption of FC between the brainstem ARAS nuclei and the left parahippocampal gyrus may underlie the pathogenesis of delirium. The corresponding FC strength could serve as an effective biomarker for predicting delirium onset. Restoring normal connectivity between these regions holds potential as a strategy for early reversal of delirium and represents a key focus for future research.

When Sean Fletcher walked into Sam Biswas' Medical and Molecular Sciences (MMSC) lab at the University of Delaware College of Health Sciences during the summer of his first year, he had no research or laboratory experience. 

Two years later, the senior honors medical diagnostics major has published a paper as a first author after uncovering new insights into how human papillomavirus (HPV) functions on a molecular level. 

In a study recently published in Virology Journal, Fletcher and co-authors Biswas, professor of MMSC, and Esther Biswas-Fiss, professor and chair of MMSC, used bioinformatics to pinpoint conserved regions of the HPV E2 protein, which plays a critical role in the virus's ability to replicate and cause cancer. The team found that specific mutations may alter protein function, significantly increasing cancer risk. 

It's rare for an undergraduate to be a first author in a prestigious journal. This really distinguishes Sean. It's a very medically-focused paper with implications for HPV - a global health problem - and potential treatments.""

Esther Biswas-Fiss, professor and chair of MMSC

Sean Fletcher (right), an aspiring physician, talks about the role of bioinformatics in his research with mentors Esther Biswas-Fiss (left), professor and chair of the Department of Medical and Molecular Sciences, and Sam Biswas (center), professor of medical and molecular sciences.

It's a feat Fletcher, a first-generation college student and Delaware native, who's bound for medical school, never dreamed of when he first came to UD.

""I knew UD had a solid research portfolio, and I'm grateful to have taken advantage of early opportunities to get involved and explore the vast world of HPV research,"" said Fletcher. 

The day after Fletcher's paper was published, Fletcher got a call from Thomas Jefferson's Sidney Kimmel Medical College to schedule an interview-a timely development that underscored the value of his publication. 

""That's the power of a first-author paper,"" said Biswas proudly. ""It's given him a huge advantage."" 

HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world, affecting up to 80% of sexually active adults. The complex virus has more than 200 strains and is the leading cause of head and neck cancer. 

""One person can be infected with a dozen or more HPV types simultaneously,"" said Biswas. ""We still don't know how they interact with one another; there's a lot that remains unknown.""

While younger adults with stronger immune systems clear HPV within two years, the 400-million-year-old virus can lie dormant in the body for years, making it harder to eliminate in people over 40. 

""Physicians may say a person is cured, but that may not always be true,"" Biswas said. ""The virus may no longer be detectable via a Pap smear in women, but the virus could have left a copy in a cell that could lead to cancer a decade later.""

Left to right, Esther Biswas-Fiss, professor and chair of medical and molecular sciences, senior honors medical diagnostics major Sean Fletcher, and Sam Biswas, professor of medical and molecular sciences, worked together to uncover specific mutations that may alter protein function and significantly increase cancer risk, paving the way for improved approaches to diagnosing and treating HPV-related cancers.

For men, there's no test for HPV, and many discover they have the virus only after a cancer diagnosis. Biswas-Fiss emphasized that understanding the virus on a molecular level is key to preventing and treating HPV.

""Many studies have focused on clinical and epidemiological approaches, including our work to determine which genotypes are more prevalent in different parts of the world,"" she said. ""But to prevent and treat HPV, we must better understand how it causes cancer on a molecular level.""

Fletcher's publication advances that goal. 

""We must study the virus both computationally and in the lab, and with this paper, we've made major headway,"" said Biswas-Fiss. ""It opens a new avenue for researchers to explore."" 

Over the next year, Fletcher plans to continue using computational biology as a microscope to examine every atom in HPV proteins. His ongoing research is supported through the Delaware INBRE Academic Year Undergraduate Fellows Award, following his participation in the Delaware INBRE Summer Student Research Program.

""What I'm doing now couldn't have been done five years ago. Using machine learning, we can identify hidden patterns in proteins and test ways to block protein interactions to prevent them from causing cancer,"" said Fletcher. ""I'm really excited to see these data-driven ideas applied to medicine and clinical data in the future.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Immune cell dysregulation and inflammatory mediators shape epilepsy risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251031/Immune-cell-dysregulation-and-inflammatory-mediators-shape-epilepsy-risk.aspx","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 01:22:00 GMT","

Emerging evidence implicates immune dysregulation and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, yet the causal mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the causal effects of immune cells and inflammatory proteins on epilepsy and evaluate the mediating role of inflammatory proteins.

This study utilized the largest available genome-wide association study data on immune cell phenotypes and inflammatory proteins as exposures, and epilepsy genome-wide association study data from the FinnGen dataset as outcomes. Five Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were applied within a two-sample MR framework to assess causal effects. Furthermore, a two-step MR analysis was conducted to quantify the proportion of epilepsy and its subtypes influenced by immune cells through inflammatory proteins.

The two-sample MR analysis identified 32 immune cell phenotypes associated with epilepsy risk (19 risk-increasing, e.g., CD19+ B cells; 13 protective, e.g., regulatory T cell subsets). Subtype analyses revealed 30 immune phenotypes associated with generalized epilepsy and 26 with focal epilepsy. Eight inflammatory proteins showed suggestive causal effects on epilepsy: C-C chemokine ligand 23, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 6, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11, and vascular endothelial growth factor A increased epilepsy risk, while interleukin-13 (IL-13), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, tumor necrosis factor, and osteoprotegerin conferred protection. Mediation analysis indicated that inflammatory proteins mediated 6.3–13.5% of the immune effects on epilepsy. Specifically, CD14+CD16+ monocytes increased epilepsy risk through elevated C-C chemokine ligand 23 levels (8.5% mediation), while effector memory double-negative (CD4−CD8−) T cells reduced epilepsy risk via upregulation of IL-13 (6.3%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings (P heterogeneity/pleiotropy > 0.05). Although no associations reached Bonferroni-corrected significance, the findings implicate B cells, monocytes, regulatory T cells, and cytokines (e.g., IL-13, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor) in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, with inflammatory proteins acting as partial mediators.

These results enhance our understanding of immune-inflammatory pathways in epilepsy and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Future studies should validate these findings across diverse populations and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the identified associations.

PARIS ST GERMAIN manager Luis Enrique tried to play down shoving Chelsea forward Joao Pedro in a near brawl between players and coaching staff following Chelsea's dominating 3-0 win in the Club World Cup final on Sunday.

The incident erupted when PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was arguing with Joao Pedro, before Luis Enrique appeared to raise his hands to the Brazilian's face.

Joao Pedro hit the deck and the PSG manager was quietly escorted away in remarkable scenes that saw players from both sides clash.

“At the end of the match, there was a situation that I believe could have been avoided by everyone,“ Luis Enrique said at a press conference after the match.

“My objective and my intention, as always, is to try to win over the players so that there are no more problems. Internally, there is a lot of tension, a lot of pressure.”

The Spanish coach acknowledged the severity of the incident, adding: “And from there, there is a series of shoves from a lot of people, which I think we should all avoid and which should not happen again.”

When it came to the match, however, he was left without answers after a brutal thrashing by Chelsea in a clash of European football's most powerful and richest clubs.

It was a surprise lopsided affair as Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer poured in two goals in eight minutes in the first half and assisted striker Joao Pedro in another score before the break.

Fans expected much more from the European Cup and French league champions that had once appeared unstoppable, cruising past Real Madrid 4-0 in the semi-final stage of the expanded, 32-team tournament.

They finished the match with 10 men after Joao Neves was shown a red card in the 85th minute for violent conduct.

“Football – that's the way it is. Can't explain everything,“ said Luis Enrique.

“I believe they actually started the game really, really well with a lot of pressure and we gave them a hard time. And then after that I believe they had opportunities to score but it didn't happen.” – REUTERS

Sports Gazette

The sports magazine brought to you by the next generation of sport writers

Over the summer I was gripped to my TV whilst the Club World Cup was on. Every twist and turn had me on the edge of my seat, sparking fierce debate about what we had just seen. I am of course talking about 90 Day Fiancé. 

Despite being free to stream, I did not watch a single second of Club World Cup action. I'm exhausted. I need a break. My summers are sacred to me, I get to have my weekends back.

FIFA seem intent on turning the football season into a 12 month ordeal. It seems no one involved in the governance of football has a clue what it's like to be a football fan.

Thierry Henry is right, it's too much. The legendary striker recently said on CBS that he's ‘tired' of the sheer amount of football on TV. “As a fan I'm tired, I didn't watch the Club World Cup… It's too much… too much is too much.”

You could, fairly, accuse me of agreeing with everything Henry says because he's Thierry Henry, but on this occasion I would agree regardless of who he scored 228 goals for. No doubt, FIFA will claim its latest innovation a great success. I'm sure lots of Fortnite-aged kids watched it. 

Football is destroying itself, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. 

I love my club, I always have and I always will, but practical realities take their toll. Do I want to spend £90 to watch Arsenal at the Emirates, or jump down a division and watch QPR for £25?

Ironically, the 3pm blackout has done nothing to support local clubs, but extortionate ticket prices have. All the 3pm blackout seems to have done recently is make a lot of money for VPN and illegal streaming services.  

It was only a few years ago we saw the biggest attempted money grab in football. The European Super League project was rendered a complete failure due to fan protests. Despite what this could have done to the football pyramid, the clubs have escaped relatively unpunished, just a bruised reputation.

Part of me wishes the ‘big six' did break away to their European Super League. It would have been so much fun to watch them skulk back after the dramatic failure it could have been. Unfortunately, I think they would have found ways to prop up the project.

Had the big six departed to the European Super League, football lovers would have traded their seats at White Hart Lane for the stands of Barnet. As much as football is about seeing the best, it's also about going out with your mates, having a drink, having a laugh, being part of a community.

I was one of those outside the Emirates Stadium protesting Arsenal's decision to abandon its roots. On that occasion, chanting and placards was enough to change club decision-making, but I can feel my economic importance to my club slipping away as it repositions itself, favouring less traditional fans who wouldn't oppose a Super League. 

When traditional forms of protests, having a shout with some signs, is rendered ineffective, what do you do to make your voice heard? That's right, you take the ultimate protest, create competition.

In 2005, a flock of Manchester United supporters made their feelings known about the new Glazer ownership by breaking off and forming their own club, FC United of Manchester. Is this now going to become a regular occurrence?

Although different, AFC Wimbledon's history is rooted in fan protest, the club was established after investors ripped the original club out of the area for profiteering. AFC Wimbledon now being higher in the football pyramid than MK Dons must hurt investors. 

Nothing will ever quite hurt a heartless venture capitalist like damaging shareholder value. 

Football is nothing without the fans, and with the increase in fan protests we have seen in recent years its plausible that democratic power of football clubs may finally be returning to fans. I have had just as much fun going to games involving teams which I don't support with my mates than I have my own club. 

There is something more enjoyable about lower league football. It's more raw, more authentic, less put together by marketing agencies and more real football. You're closer to the pitch, the players are more relatable, the atmosphere is often better, and in my experience its often just as fun. 

I will always love my club, but who said anything about it having to be the men's team? For less than £20 I can see Arsenal Women's at the Emirates Stadium. 

Embed from Getty Images

Over the 2024/25 season Sky report Arsenal had an average attendance of 34,000 for its women's team. Having been to a lot of women's games now, I almost somewhat prefer them. There is no threat of violence, there's no one entering a fit of rage because of their acca, and I can have a pint in the stands. 

Women's football has grown massively in its own right over the last decade. Arsenal's two Champions League titles highlight the growth, with their 2007 final played in front of 3,400 people at Meadow Park, and their 2025 win at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in front of 38,000. 

I am not saying women's football is dependent or needs the downfall of men's football to be successful. What I am saying, is if the downfall of men's football helps accelerate the growth of women's, then I'm all for it. 

Too much greed will kill the company. In the animal kingdom parasites can't afford to kill the host body, and these venture capitalists need to realise that.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, kicking off June 11 across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, will feature 48 teams in 104 matches over 39 days, coinciding with America's 250th anniversary. While the event was expected to spark surging hotel demand in host cities, its impact has so far fallen short of expectations, more so in the United States to date, especially as prices for U.S. World Cup tickets are significantly more expensive than in Canada and Mexico.

Tighter borders, trade tensions, and stricter visa requirements are driving a decline in U.S. tourism, affecting sectors ranging from hospitality to construction. With major ticket sales still ahead for FIFA 2026, the U.S. trails its World Cup co-hosts in year-over-year growth in hotel rates.

Experts point to several factors behind the slowdown, but with nine months remaining, the U.S. hotel industry could see a sharp rebound in bookings after the final draw and full match schedule are released on December 5.

Hospitality data firm Lighthouse reports that length-of-stay rules have limited hotel inventory for FIFA 2026, with occupancy in most host cities still in single digits, nine months before the event. The U.S. also shows the slowest room rate growth during the tournament, with Mexico leading the surge, followed closely by Canada.

Despite differing price surges across regions, average room rates remain well above typical 2026 levels and higher than the same period in 2025, signaling what Lighthouse calls a “clear anticipation of future demand.”

""When viewed in context, current booking levels are higher than normal for this time of year, but still far below what a World Cup host market would typically expect,"" the report states.

The report attributes the slower growth in room rates in the U.S. to a combination of structural and cultural factors. Canada and Mexico have smaller hotel inventories, and Mexico's strong soccer culture has fueled earlier demand.

There is also a projected dip in international travel spending in the U.S. for 2025, with more restrictive visa conditions and tighter border procedures.

For hotels in U.S. host cities, the FIFA World Cup has driven aggressive pricing strategies and heightened expectations, with year-over-year rate growth outpacing the national average. The tournament's impact is evident, just not as pronounced as many anticipated.

Hotel Room Rate Growth in the U.S. in 2026

Year-over-Year Growth

U.S. host cities during the weeks of competition

The rest of the U.S. during the weeks of competition

3%

U.S. host cities during the weeks of No competition

6%

The rest of the U.S. during the weeks of No competition

2.5%

The report indicates that, while current booking levels exceed typical figures for this time of year, they remain significantly below what's expected for a World Cup host market. The most substantial uptick is seen in the opening two weeks of the group stage, when occupancy nearly doubles amid peak fan interest.

FIFA announced earlier this month that over a million tickets have been sold out of an estimated 7.1 million. With roughly six million tickets, about 85%, still available, and several factors weighing on early demand, the main hotel booking surge, particularly in the U.S., is yet to come.

The report also notes that many hotels appear unavailable during the tournament, either due to length-of-stay restrictions or withheld inventory.

 With both hotels and fans “on pause” until the final ticket draw on December 5, a surge in bookings is expected once fans learn where their teams will play.

“Many hotels are holding back inventory and setting minimum-stay requirements in anticipation of higher-value bookings later,” the report also said.

Despite a slow start in bookings, average hotel rates across North America, including the U.S., for the World Cup period remain well above typical 2026 levels and higher than the same dates in 2025.

FIFA has also announced that its resale site is now open, and tickets for the World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are available on the FIFA website at prices ranging from $9,538 to $57,500 per seat.

Marc Guehi, Conor Gallagher, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Phil Foden and Morgan Gibbs-White are all in contention to be a part of Thomas Tuchel's England side bidding to be crowned world champions next July in the United States. But all of them have already had a taste of what it feels like to hold that title.

They were all members of the England squad who won the Under-17s World Cup eight years ago this week. It was a talented team. Jadon Sancho, Emile Smith Rowe and Angel Gomes also featured, and have also gone on to wear the Three Lions at senior level.

Not all of the party who travelled to that tournament in India went on to have such glittering careers — Curtis Anderson, the goalkeeper who was the hero of a penalty shootout victory against Japan in the round of 16, has given up the pro game and now works as financial advisor helping guide young players on what to do with their money, and several others have forged only modest careers in the lower leagues — but that side's collective achievement still serves as inspiration to the teenage generations following in their footsteps.

Another crop of England Under-17s are about to try to repeat that feat in the age group's latest World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar on Monday.

Like the senior version of the tournament, which is expanding from 32 teams in its previous edition three years ago to 48 next June and July, the field is far bigger than the 24 sides who qualified for those 2017 finals. Former Manchester United youth coach Neil Ryan's England will compete against 47 other nations to lift the trophy on November 27, and he believes this experience could be invaluable in the development of players who have yet to experience big-game environments and atmospheres.

“We're going to give the players a challenge playing against the world's best teams,” Ryan tells The Athletic. “The 2017 team was littered with talent. Of course, there are players who haven't gone on to have such amazing careers, so you see the challenges they still face. There is certainly no guarantee this team will go on to play for the seniors in the future, but what you want to do is give them experience, put them under the pressure of a big tournament.

“The challenge is the tactics, the crowds, the pressure that comes with the games of tournament football — and of course, the World Cup. Hopefully, at the end of it, they will go back to their clubs and it will aid them as they progress along the pathway to senior football.”

Dan Ashworth, who was technical director at the time, introduced the concept of the ‘England DNA' in 2014 — a coordinated youth development process based at the FA's national teams headquarters at St George's Park in the Midlands.

For a decade, coaches have been nurturing future generations of young players, who have already received advanced coaching at Category 1 club academies around the country, with the view that everything about playing for England at the various age groups is the same: the training-camp environment, the training sessions, the approach to and preparation for games. It means that if they are eventually good enough to step up to senior level, the only thing that will be a shock to them will be the bigger stage. Everything else will feel familiar.

It has brought results. In 2014, the under-17s won that age group's European Championship. As well as that Under-17 World Cup in 2017, the under-20s also won their version and the under-19s were crowned European champions. There was another Under-19 Euros triumph in 2022, and England Under-21s celebrated back-to-back European titles in 2023 and again this summer.

Since 2014, the full England side have also got to two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final but are yet to lift silverware.

The aim of the under-17s, and all the age groups, is ultimately to see youth success replicated at senior level as well as maintained at events such as the one about to begin in Qatar.

“If our boys can do well at these tournaments, get that experience, that is something that you would hope eventually they can take with them to the seniors, and to the big tournaments,” Ryan says. “That's been the whole purpose of the pathway: to feed players to the senior team and give them great experiences, so it's not their first experience when they arrive at the World Cup next summer.

“John McDermott (the FA's technical director) oversees the whole structure from under-15s upwards, and it is about the England DNA, about continuity and playing the England way.”

England had to come through a tough qualifying campaign to reach this World Cup, and there is never a guarantee that they will be part of every age-group tournament going forward. A case in point: although 48 teams are competing in these finals, two traditional European footballing powers in Spain and the Netherlands will not be among them.

They will also be facing some unknowns: there will be the heat of Qatar to acclimatise to, even though, as with the 2022 senior World Cup, it is being staged in the northern hemisphere's winter when temperatures in the Gulf state are lower than in summer and they held a warm-weather training camp in Cadiz, southern Spain, in September.

England are in Group E, and will face Venezuela in their opening game on Tuesday, November 4, Haiti three days later and Egypt next Monday, November 10. If they are successful, it could mean playing a total of eight games in 23 days with a 21-strong squad, fewer than managers get for a senior World Cup, that includes three goalkeepers.

“Our boys have not played these opponents in the group stages before, and they'll all bring such different challenges for us — the cultures, the different styles of play,” Ryan says. “Each game brings its pressure to both nations, and the world is watching.

“It's a fantastic opportunity for these boys to be testing themselves a little bit of the unknown. We will be prepared, but there is still that unknown element to it, and we want to do ourselves justice by knowing how well these boys can perform, make sure they perform and go out there and give themselves the best chance.

“It's a great challenge, but it is what we want. The pressure of getting to these tournaments and competing will hopefully benefit the senior team in the future.”

FORT WORTH, Texas — If you live or otherwise spend time in the vicinity of TCU's Amon G. Carter Stadium, don't be alarmed by the sound of gunfire and shouting over the next couple of days.

On Oct. 27 and 28, area first responders are conducting emergency preparedness drills at TCU in advance of next year's FIFA World Cup, during which nine games will be played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Over the course of about a month, tens of thousands of spectators and fans are expected to descend upon North Texas, which brings added security concerns.

In addition to TCU, 14 other sites in Tarrant, Collin and Dallas counties are hosting response maneuvers in coordination with approximately 100 area agencies, which include police departments, fire departments and local hospitals.

At Amon G. Carter Stadium on Oct. 27, SWAT officers in full body armor trained for what appeared to be an active shooter scenario, storming the stadium's concourses with rifles drawn. At one point, the pop of simulated gunfire echoed from the end zone.

Rose Hoffman, a city of Willow Park spokesperson, was on site as a media liaison. She said public information officers like herself were also taking part in the drills, preparing for how to disseminate and share information in the event of an incident during the World Cup.

“We're going to be focusing on interagency cooperation across multiple sites to make sure all of our communications systems work correctly, and also that we're able to coordinate together as a group,” Hoffman said.

Elsewhere in Tarrant County, drills are being conducted at the Fort Worth Police Department's Bob Bolen Public Safety Complex and at Six Flags in Arlington. As far as other stadiums, Riders Field in Frisco, home of the Frisco RoughRiders, is hosting maneuvers.

Fort Worth is already preparing for an influx of visitors for the World Cup next June and July. City officials have said plans are underway to beef up the public transportation infrastructure and security protocols, as well as market area attractions and businesses to prospective guests and the worldwide media.

Sonny Saxton, Fort Worth's director of emergency communications and management, told the City Council in September that the Fort Worth Police Department, the Fort Worth Fire Department and hospitals have all been involved in planning for crowd management and emergency response.

Michael Crum, director of Fort Worth's public events department, said the city will be well prepared by next summer to handle a large number of visitors while ensuring everyday services are not affected.

Wayne Rooney has revealed that he came very close to joining Manchester United's Premier League rivals before completing his fateful transfer to Old Trafford from Everton. The forward joined the Red Devils as a prodigious 18-year-old and went on to become a club legend, playing 559 matches and scoring 253 goals, but things could have been very different.

Rooney was hot property in the summer of 2004 after a breakout season for Everton and shining for England at the European Championship in Portugal before an untimely broken foot cut his tournament short. The forward dramatically handed in a transfer request at Everton late in the transfer window, and Man Utd completed a £27 million deal for his services within a few days. However, they were not the only interested party, with Newcastle coming up short in the race for his signature despite a phone call from club legend Alan Shearer and iconic manager Sir Bobby Robson - albeit he got young Rooney's name wrong. The former player revealed he would have joined the Magpies after they made an offer that summer, but their bid actually forced United's hand.

""I would have certainly went [to Newcastle],"" Rooney revealed on his self-titled podcast The Wayne Rooney Show. ""Manchester United wanted to wait a season and then sign me the year after they did sign me. Newcastle put a bid in and if Manchester United hadn't come in, I would have gone to Newcastle.

""Those two were bidding against each other. My agent's best mate was chairman at Newcastle at the time! So I'm sure he was getting nudged to try to get me as well. I wanted to go to Manchester United, but I spoke with Sir Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer.

""In true Bobby Robson style, on the phone he called me 'Mark'. I thought he had either forgotten my name or he was a genius - because that's my middle name.""

Ultimately, Man Utd would be very, very glad that they got the deal over the line ahead of Newcastle and didn't wait, as originally planned. Speaking at the time, revered former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: ""I am very excited. I think we have got the best young player this country has seen in the past 30 years. Everyone is delighted by this signing.""

That turned out to be a pretty accurate assessment, as the teenager blossomed into one of the finest players England has ever seen and became a club legend at Old Trafford, scoring 253 goals in 559 trophy-laden appearances for the club, including five Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008 as a star-studded United side edged Chelsea on penalties.

Discussing his relationship with Ferguson, Rooney added: ""I always remember the one thing he said and he said it a few times, is 'the hardest thing to do in life is work hard'. That stuck with me. Whatever job you're doing that can apply to anything really. I think in football we have talent, we have ability but sometimes we don't look at working hard every day. And you'd think that's, that's normal.

""You should do that if you, you played in a big club, but if some players actually you've seen them, they don't. And so that was the one thing which stuck with me.""

Rooney has, however, been markedly less successful in his coaching career so far, having had short-lived, ill-fated spells in charge at Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle, following his time at Derby County and MLS side D.C. United.

Having been sacked by Plymouth in late 2024, the 40-year-old is yet to return to the dugout, instead focusing on TV work as a pundit, as well as his new podcast with the BBC. Whether he will fancy another foray into the world of management remains to be seen after his recent negative experiences.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liverpool boss Arne Slot addresses sack talk as pressure cranks up amid Reds' torrid run of form","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/liverpool-arne-slot-sack-talk-pressure-reds-torrid-run-form/blt7ae9c514cfd08e83","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 11:21:12 GMT","

Liverpool manager Arne Slot addressed talk of him losing his job amid the Reds' torrid run of form as pressure cranks up on the Dutch manager. The reigning English champions got off to a flying start in their title defence campaign but are now struggling for form as they have lost six out of their last seven matches across all competitions and are already seven points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal.

The Reds spent heavily in the summer transfer window to rebuild their title-winning squad as they broke the British transfer record twice in the same window to sign big names like Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen and Alexander Isak from Newcastle United. Slot further bolstered his attack by securing a transfer for Hugo Ekitike, while he replaced Real Madrid-bound Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong.

Liverpool got off to a flying start with seven wins in a row as they looked set for a successful title defence. However, since their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on September 27, Slot's side has lost six out of seven matches, including four consecutive defeats in the league. They have fallen to seventh position in the table and are as many points behind league leaders Arsenal.

Amid the club's poor run of form, there has been speculation over Slot's future at Anfield and the Dutchman has now addressed talk of him getting sacked.

""For me they say similar things,"" the Liverpool head coach said. ""I speak mainly to Richard and once in a while to the others (Edwards and FSG). They also see similar things as what I see. For me the conversations haven't changed a lot. We always talk about the game and it's always nicer to talk about the game if you have won than if you have lost.

""[I feel supported] not only in this period but also when things go well. I'm a firm believer all the squads I had were 20-21 players that can play because if you have too many it's already a struggle to make a squad. But then you have to keep them fit. Tell me if I'm wrong but I think during the week [the reaction] was about when I said something about the squad we are having, and that could have been seen as criticising or an excuse? 

""What I meant was, if these players are all fit we have so much quality. This club is in such a good place when you look at the quality we have for the short-term future and the long-term future. But – I've used Alex (Alexander Isak) as an example but I don't want to go into every single player because players sometimes don't like it when they are named as being fit or not – not all of them were ready from the start to play three games in seven days.

""And then when you get four injuries like we have at the moment, it is a struggle going into a programme like this. I used this to explain my line-up on Wednesday. I didn't use it as an excuse for losing against Brentford or the loss before or the loss before. I did it because Ibou (Ibrahima Konate) and Virgil (van Dijk) had to play a lot. Joe Gomez missed out on the whole of pre-season. Macca (Alexis Mac Allister) missed out on the whole of pre-season.""

When asked about the potential for a contract extension rather than an exit, Slot added: ""That is the last question I was expecting. I think my focus can be completely on getting Liverpool back to winning ways. That's my first answer. The second answer is that contract talks, if they are even there, we never speak about this here. But let us first start to win again, that's where my main focus is.""

Slot's men are scheduled to face Aston Villa at home on Saturday, before they host Real Madrid in the Champions League on November 4 and then take on Manchester City five days later at Etihad Stadium. The English champions will hope to get back to winning against Unai Emery's men before approaching the crunch games against the two giants of European football.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana has been spared jail time despite being caught on camera driving dangerously in his Lamborghini. This was the French defender's ninth driving offence, and he is already serving a driving ban until May 2027. Fofana, who has been plagued by injuries in recent years, has appeared in five matches across all competitions for the Blues in the 2025-26 campaign, including three in the league.

According to The Sun, Fofana was caught speeding and weaving through traffic on the A3 Esher Bypass in Hook, Surrey. The incident was caught on a dashcam and the footage was presented in court. While the Blues star was spared jail time for what was his ninth driving offence at the age of 25, he has been ordered to serve 300 hours of unpaid community service. He has also been hit with a fresh 18-month driving ban, although his licence is suspended until May 2027 for previous offences. The Frenchman has also been ordered to pay just £85 in costs and a £114 victim surcharge. The video below was shared by the Crown Prosecution Service.



District Judge Julie Cooper slammed Fofana inside the courtroom for setting the wrong example for young people who look up to professional footballers like him.

She said: ""You obviously realise there are a lot of young people who look up to you and they would like to be like you and follow you. That's part of the whole gig. However, they will not be able to afford these expensive cars, with all their additions that keep them safe and you could have some 17-year-old, who has just passed their test, who think they can copy you. They will not be able to handle their car and do some ridiculous driving manoeuvres and they are dead. You need to be much more responsible about your behaviour.""

Prosecutor Rabbi Khan said: ""The witness identified the danger and this defendant was driving on the hard shoulder at speed in a 50mph zone. The offence is aggravated by an approaching bend that was signposted and he is not indicating when making these manoeuvres. He refused to abide by the road rules at speed.""

Representing Fofana, his solicitor Imogen Cox told the court: ""The video speaks for itself – 15 to 20 seconds of driving that are conceded. There is no explanation or excuse for his driving on that day. He attended voluntarily for an interview at Guildford Police Station and apologised for driving and said he had learned a valuable lesson about his driving and had no explanation for his driving on that day. This offence pre-dates the speeding offences, which were all within a seven-month period and tied-up at Lavender Hill. He is essentially of good character, having no criminal convictions against him. He is fit and healthy and able to carry out community work.""

This incident happened only months after Fofana was caught speeding in his white Rolls Royce Cullinan, a blue 4.0 litre Audi and his Lamborghini Urus. Several of the offences were on his route to and from Chelsea's training ground at Cobham, which is a 50mph zone. He was caught speeding at 77mph, 68mph, 90mph, 88mph and 67mph on five separate occasions. Fofana admitted all the offences and was also fined a total of £5,328, plus a £2,131 victim surcharge and £110 costs at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court. The defender had previously been disqualified for six months in January 2023 and was involved in a car crash involving Eastenders star Dean Gaffney that left the actor with a broken collarbone in December 2022. He already had 47 points on his licence and the fresh incident helped collect 38 more.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Inter Miami will look to reach the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time in club history when they face Nashville SC Saturday in the second leg of the opening playoff round at Geodis Stadium. The visitors are under pressure to win and close out the series, while the hosts will aim to force a decisive third game.

For the second game of the series, Miami visit to Nashville - a team they've defeated twice in the past two weeks, both times convincingly.

Despite those recent wins, the Miami manager Javier Mascherano acknowledged Nashville's quality and the challenges they've posed to his side, emphasizing the need for focus and improvement ahead of Saturday's decisive playoff match. The Herons hold an 8-3 aggregate goal advantage over Nashville across their last two meetings.

“We have to pay attention to the details and keep improving to arrive in the best possible shape,” Mascherano said. “Even though we've had two good results against them in recent weeks, we know Nashville have put us in tough situations before. We managed to handle them well, but we expect them to test us again, and we have to be ready for that.”

The Inter Miami boss confirmed that he will have a full squad available, with the only exception being David Ruiz, who remains in recovery. The team's key figures - including Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Rodrigo De Paul - are all fit and available for selection.

“We have a core group - a spine that's untouchable - because any team that wants to succeed needs one,” Mascherano said. “From there, we make adjustments depending on what the team and the game demand. I don't believe in identical matches, so it's essential that everyone understands their importance.

""I always say the quality of minutes matters more than the quantity. We'll decide who starts based on what we think the match requires. Aside from David, who's still recovering, everyone's ready - and every player will have a role to play.”

Mascherano addressed De Paul's recent trip to Argentina following Inter Miami's 3-1 win over Nashville in the first game of the series. The midfielder used his days off to travel to Buenos Aires to take care of personal matters - and also attended Futttura, the debut concert of his partner, Tini Stoessel.

“He had to travel for personal reasons, and we gave him permission,” Mascherano said. “When you give players time off, you don't ask what they're going to do.”

If Miami win Game 2 of the series at GEODIS Park, they would advance to the next round - and in doing so, erase the bitter memory of last season, when - after claiming the Supporters' Shield with a record points total - they were eliminated at the same round by Atlanta United, a team that had only made it through via the Wild Card.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Explore our soccer expert's Liverpool vs Aston Villa predictions, pre Saturday's 4pm ET Premier League clash (11/01).

Our betting expert expects a difficult evening for Liverpool, as they try to rediscover last season's form, with the result hanging in the balance. 



Liverpool have become renowned for their attacking football. The Reds always deliver entertainment and goals. They've scored 16 in nine league games so far, the second-best in the league alongside Arsenal and Bournemouth. 

However, their defence has struggled this term. They've conceded 14 goals in the league, nine more than they did at the same stage last term. Notably, 78% of their league matches this season produced goals at both ends. 

While they haven't blanked, they conceded at least once in each of their last five outings. Villa will take advantage of that, especially because they've scored at least one goal in their last five matches. 

Both teams scored in three of the last five meetings, and the same happened in four of Liverpool's five most recent matches in all competitions. Additionally, four of Villa's last five road trips saw both teams score on the day. 

The hosts are under pressure at the moment, and that could go two ways. Either they come out fighting and get past Villa, or they struggle to get out of the current slump they're in. Losing four games on the trot isn't easy, and they could fall into a losing habit. 

Emery's troops can capitalise on that and maybe register their first win against Liverpool in 10 attempts. The Reds are still favourites to win this one, having done so in six of their last seven at Anfield. However, only two of Villa's last nine league games have been won by the pre-match favourites. 

Top-flight English champions have suffered five-game losing streaks just seven times. Three of those involved Liverpool, so the visitors could really test the home side on Saturday. Even if they don't get the three points, you can't help but feel the Villains might take something away this time. 

Although he had a quiet spell, Mo Salah finally got onto the scoresheet last weekend. He is just one goal involvement away from the record set by Wayne Rooney for one club. The Egyptian has 275 goal involvements, and 13 of those have come against Villa. 

However, his personal record against the visitors is staggering. Salah has faced them 13 times, winning nine, and scoring nine goals with six assists. 

Liverpool fans hope that his drought is over, and that the team's overall form has improved. However, even if the Reds don't win, Salah remains a threat and may well score.

What began as another dominant campaign for Liverpool has quickly gone off course. The Premier League champions have hit a slump, losing four league games in a row. Arne Slot had previously only lost four of his first 43 league games in charge of the Reds. 

Now, he has lost four Premier League fixtures on the bounce, after only nine games into the season. However, it's still way too early to rule the Reds out of successfully defending their 20th title. 

The last time the Merseysiders lost five league matches in succession was back in 1953. A defeat here would not only equal that record but also set an unwanted new one. Liverpool will join Leicester City as the only reigning Premier League champions to lose five consecutively. 

The Reds were also eliminated from the League Cup by Crystal Palace during the week, which added to the misery. Meanwhile, Aston Villa have had quite an opposite season. After a slow and dismal start to the campaign, Unai Emery's men have found their rhythm once again. 

Following last weekend's victory over Man City, they have a chance to make a little history of their own. If they beat Liverpool, they'll become just the second team - after Leicester in their title-winning season - to beat both sides in consecutive gameweeks. 

Liverpool expected lineup: Mamardashvili, Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez, Szoboszlai, MacAllister, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Ekitike

Aston Villa expected lineup: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne, Kamara, Onana, McGinn, Rogers, Guessand, Watkins","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 One of the ATP Tour's most prolific indoor performers is showing no sign of slowing down at the Rolex Paris Masters. 

 Felix Auger-Aliassime on Saturday continued his late-2025 purple patch with an impressive 7-6(3), 6-4 semi-final victory against Alexander Bublik in the French capital. The ninth-seeded Canadian was clinical with his chances in his 96-minute victory to secure a spot in his second ATP Masters 1000 final and simultaneously replace Lorenzo Musetti in the final qualification spot for the Nitto ATP Finals. 

Got the job done 💼@felixtennis | @RolexPMasters | #RolexParisMasters pic.twitter.com/wdxg5SrqIN

 “I'm so happy. A Masters 1000 final sounds really good,” said Auger-Aliassime after reaching his second championship match at that level after Madrid 2024. “You don't play those finals every week. Hopefully I can go all the way and get the title. In terms of today and even the past matches… You get into a Masters, and every match is tough. 

 “It's a 56-draw and it is stacked. You wake up on a day and feel, ‘This guy is playing good, everybody is playing good'. So you're always curious and bit nervous to see how your game is going to match up. I have deep self confidence in my game. I know what I can do against the best players in the world, but you still have to go and execute. Today I did really well and I'm happy with the result.” 

 As well as setting a championship-match clash with second seed Jannik Sinner or third seed Alexander Zverev in Paris, Auger-Aliassime also made a significant move in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin with his semi-final triumph. The 25-year-old has leapfrogged Musetti into eighth place, and he can wrap up the one remaining qualification spot at the Nitto ATP Finals by lifting the trophy in France on Sunday. 

 If Auger-Aliassime does not lift the Paris trophy, he will nonetheless head to next week's Moselle Open in Metz with a 90-point lead over Musetti in the Live Race. Italy's Musetti will also be in ATP 250 action next week in Athens. 

 “These are the matches you train for and play for,” said Auger-Aliassime, when asked how he would approach Sunday's final against Sinner or Zverev in Paris. “It's always great to play these guys and see how my game matches with theirs. I've played tennis for a long time. You are training all these years to improve. 

 “I've played some great opponents and tomorrow I have the chance to showcase it in front of everyone. I'm going to wake up ready. At the same time, with these guys, you have to be so sharp. Tactically, and with discipline. They don't give you anything, so you have to be ready to play you're A-game.” 



 Against Bublik, Auger-Aliassime clinched a tight first set that did not feature a break point by winning six of the final seven points in the tie-break. In contrast to the opener, the second set featured five breaks of serve: Bublik appeared to have responded well to the disappointment of dropping the first set and the Kazakhstani forged a 4-1 lead, but Auger-Aliassime stormed back with five straight games to prevail. 

 The Canadian finished the match having struck 31 winners, 17 of which came from his forehand wing. Against the big-serving Bublik, who was competing in his maiden Masters 1000 semi-final, Auger-Aliassime also clinically converted three of the four break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. 

 With his triumph at La Défense Arena, Auger-Aliassime improved to 4-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Bublik. He has now won a Tour-leading 82 indoor matches this decade.

As the Stefanie Graf Group gets underway at the WTA Finals in Riyadh, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka takes on No. 8 Jasmine Paolini and defending champion Coco Gauff plays fellow American Jessica Pegula.

Day 1 of the WTA Finals in Riyadh featured the Serena Williams Group in singles and the Martina Navratilova Group in doubles.  

On Sunday the year-end event shifts gears to the Stefanie Graf Group and the Liezel Huber Group. 





 WTA
                        

Defending champion Coco Gauff and World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka will play their opening matches, and Jasmine Paolini starts her singles campaign after playing her first doubles match on Saturday with Sara Errani. 

Below is the order of the play, match times and breakdowns of the four matches on the docket.

Note: All matches are local time.

Dabrowski and Routliffe had a brilliant North American hard-court swing, winning Cincinnati and then the US Open. But in their lone match against Andreeva and Shnaider this season, on clay in Rome, they came up short. The quarterfinal match was an epic, with Andreeva and Shnaider taking the third set 11-9.

Head to Head: Sabalenka leads 5-2

The Case for Sabalenka: Do we really need to make one? She's two months removed from a second straight US Open title, is No. 1 in the world (and has been for a year) and is likely the best hard-court player on tour. She's also won her past four matches against Paolini, one of which was a 6-3, 7-5 win at this tournament a year ago.

They've played each other in two semifinals this year, in Miami and then in Stuttgart, and Sabalenka took both in straights. In fact, Paolini hasn't taken a set off Sabalenka since Indian Wells in 2022, which is the last time she beat her. 

The Case for Paolini: If we've learned anything about Paolini in the past two years, it's not to doubt her.

Case in point: Three weeks ago in Wuhan, Paolini entered her quarterfinal match having never beaten Iga Swiatek in six tries -- and taking just one set. Playing as the clear underdog, she dominated from start to finish, dropping just three games in 65 minutes.

Paolini can beat anyone.

Head to Head: Pegula leads 4-3

The Case for Gauff: She's the defending champion in Riyadh, she generally plays her best at this late stage of the season and she's fresh off her third WTA 1000 title in Wuhan.

In that final she beat Pegula, her old friend and former doubles partner, 6-4, 7-5.

They met in Riyadh a year ago, in the group stage, and Gauff also won that one in straights. These two share a close bond, and they know each other's games intimately well. Gauff knows what she needs to do to win.

The Case for Pegula: The same can be said for Pegula! The 31-year-old knows Gauff's game backwards and forwards, and clearly has a strategy in place to pull off the upset. Whether she's able to execute it is a different story.

Pegula has been red hot, though, going 13-3 since the start of the US Open and reaching the semifinals or better in her last three tournaments (one Slam and two WTA 1000s). She also has the edge in the career head to head, though three of those wins came before 2024.

World No. 1 Siniakova's accolades speak for themselves: 32 career titles, 10 Grand Slams and a WTA Finals title in 2021. Townsend has built a hell of a resume in her own right, winning 11 titles with seven different partners.

Siniakova and Townsend reached the finals in Riyadh a year ago after winning Wimbledon, and they followed that up with titles in Melbourne and Dubai in 2025.

This will be their third match this year against Babos and Stefani. They beat them in three sets in the third round of Roland Garros, and a month later beat them again in the Wimbledon quarterfinals.

Felix Auger-Aliassime is through to the final of the Rolex Paris Masters after ending the run of Alexander Bublik in the semifinals of the Masters 1000 event on Saturday afternoon, 7-6 (3), 6-4.With that victory, the Canadian is now one win away from the biggest title of his career—his biggest titles to date are three ATP 500s, at Rotterdam and Basel in 2022 and Basel again in 2023.But just as (if not more) pressing, Auger-Aliassime is now one win away from qualifying for this year's ATP Finals in Turin.

There are now only two players left in contention for the last spot in the elite eight-man field in Turin—Auger-Aliassime, whose victory in Paris on Saturday moves him up from No. 9 to No. 8 in the Race to the ATP Finals with 3,845 points, and Lorenzo Musetti, who slips from No. 8 to No. 9 in the race standings with 3,685 points.Musetti lost his opening match in Paris earlier in the week.The two are both scheduled to play next week, the last week of tournaments that count in the race, Auger-Aliassime playing in Metz and Musetti in Athens. Those are both ATP 250 events.But if the Canadian wins Paris on Sunday, he'll have 4,195 points, which is well out of reach of anything the Italian can pick up next week, and thus securing the eighth and final spot in Turin.

There was little between Auger-Aliassime and Bublik in the first set on Saturday, with 12 straight holds to start the match, and the Canadian sneaking out the 50-minute opening frame in a tie-break.There were all kinds of momentum swings in the second set, though, as Bublik broke early for a 2-0 lead—and then, after getting broken right back, breaking again for a 3-1 lead, and then holding for 4-1.But Auger-Aliassime caught fire from there, reeling off five games in a row—and 14 of the last 17 points of the match—to close it out.The Canadian finished with more than twice as many winners as the Kazakh, 31 to 15, as well as fewer unforced errors, 21 to 23.""I'm so happy. A Masters 1000 final sounds really good,"" Auger-Aliassime said after the match. ""You don't play those finals every week, every day, so hopefully I can go all the way and get the title.""But in terms of today, and even the last matches, you get to a Masters and every match is tough. It's a 56 draw, it's stacked, you wake up every day and this guy's playing good, this guy's playing good, everybody's playing good.

Indycar winner and F1 TV analyst takes a close look at Oliver Bearman's impressive rookie season – and wonders what might be next for the talented Ferrari academy driver.

This season an impressive crop of rookies joined the Formula 1 the grid. At various times in the year a case could've been made for several of them to be the top performer among their freshman counterparts.

Right from the out it was Kimi Antonelli's form in tough conditions in Australia.

Then, you can't forget Isack Hadjar's impressive bounce back from the crushing warm-up lap crash in Melbourne to score in five of the next eight races – with two 11th places mixed in for good measure.

With Lewis Hamilton recently stating that he is ""finally feeling on top of the car"" as he continues to adapt at Ferrari, Fred Vasseur has reflected on the importance of getting those details right.

Fred Vasseur believes that Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari both needed “time to be on the same page” when it came to certain details as the partnership between the two sides began this season.

Hamilton took the F1 world by surprise when his headline switch to the Scuderia on a multi-year deal starting from 2025 was announced ahead of the 2024 campaign getting underway, bringing his extensive and hugely successful relationship with Mercedes to an end.

The seven-time World Champion has faced mixed fortunes during his debut season as a Ferrari driver but recently shared positive comments about how he is adapting to the SF-25, having said after the United States Grand Prix: “I'm finally feeling like I'm on top of the car.”

Asked one week later in Mexico about how much work had gone into Hamilton and the team reaching this point, Vasseur explained the importance of ensuring that the squad are on top of every detail given how close the competition is.

“It's like this from the beginning of the season, that the field is mega, mega tight this year, that you have guys moving from P18 sometimes to P3 or P4,” said Vasseur. “It means that if you leave something on the table, you are losing positions.

“Lewis needed – and the team needed – time to be exactly on the same page on some details, and for every single detail today you are losing positions. It means that we need to be in full control of everything, and it's the clear target for all of us.”

While Hamilton is still searching for a maiden Grand Prix podium in red, Ferrari have enjoyed visits to the rostrum lately with Charles Leclerc, the Monegasque having claimed a P3 in Austin before following this up with a P2 finish in Mexico seven days on.

Speaking before the result at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Vasseur admitted that the squad's return to the podium at the Circuit of The Americas had offered them encouragement as they fight for second in the Teams' Championship against Mercedes and Red Bull.

“It's a good push for the motivation but, in any case, we are motivated by the target to finish P2,” the Team Principal conceded. “It's a good challenge, a long fight until the end of the championship, and let's see what will happen in the next weekends.”

Although Ferrari retook second place in Mexico, the Silver Arrows remain only one point behind in third while fourth-placed Red Bull have only a 10-point deficit to the Italian team.

From Lando Norris' disco ball to Alex Albon's Miami orange, special edition helmets have been everywhere this season. We take a look back at where it all began.

Special edition helmets are a relatively recent addition to Formula 1's long history – what was once purely a piece of safety equipment has become a canvas for drivers and sponsors to showcase their personality, pay tribute or have some fun.

The journey from mostly plain lids to glittering, custom-designed works of art has been full of experimentation over the years – including design restrictions and concerns about the weight of paint. Here's a look back at how special edition helmets became a beloved part of F1's identity.

In a sport where faces are hidden behind visors, a helmet has always been a driver's signature. For decades, drivers such as James Hunt, John Surtees, and Sir Jackie Stewart kept the same design throughout their entire careers.

Back then, helmets weren't nearly as protective, and their main purpose besides safety was for the fans and marshals to tell the drivers apart. Even so, individuality did shine through at time. Hunt's name stretched boldly along the side of his helmet, while Stewart paid homage to his Scottish roots with a tartan band around the crown.

Few designs, however, are as instantly recognisable as Ayrton Senna's yellow, green and blue helmet – an enduring Brazilian icon that once fetched nearly $1million at auction.

For much of F1's history, a helmet represented the driver but not the team. That began to change when Michael Schumacher moved to Ferrari and decided to replace the German flag on his helmet with a bright red design to match his new team's colours. This marked the start of a new, more flexible era, one where creativity and collaboration between driver and team became the norm.

Helmet designs don't come out of thin air, and every special edition helmet begins with an artist – both a designer and engineer. Two of the best-known names in this profession are Jens Munser and Mad 56.

Munser, the mastermind behind Schumacher's Ferrari-era lids, Lando Norris's squiggles, and Sebastian Vettel's 2024 Imola Senna tribute explained to Motorsport Tech Magazine: “The process hasn't changed much – we still start with sketches – but we now use printed stickers for logos instead of hand-painting every detail. We've improved the pigments to make paint lighter and more resistant to stones. Michael always wanted to save weight, even if it meant a less glossy finish.”

Mad 56, real name Massimo Dante, works primarily with Red Bull and has also collaborated with Williams driver Alex Albon for more than a decade. Though artists have creative freedom, they must balance aesthetics with FIA regulations and sponsor requirements, which is a tricky art in itself.

In 2015, the FIA announced that drivers must stick to a single helmet design during the entire season, as some of the constantly changing special edition helmets were starting to cause issues. The reasoning was simple: fans, commentators, and race officials were struggling to recognise who was behind the wheel!

The move came after a series of increasingly elaborate designs – most famously Sebastian Vettel's 2012 LED-lit helmet in Singapore. The glowing design, while undoubtedly eye-catching, raised safety concerns and was quickly banned, prompting the FIA to rethink just how far helmet customisation should go.

The single-design regulation remained in place until 2020, but even under those tighter rules, creativity didn't disappear. Designers found clever ways to work within the limits – for example, Lewis Hamilton's special edition Mexico City Grand Prix helmets, or Sebastian Vettel subtly changing the colour of his usual helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix in 2017.

When the ban was lifted at the beginning of 2020, a wave of colour and creativity returned to the grid – and it hasn't slowed down since.

Today, F1's grid is awash with one-off designs, each a reflection of personality, heritage, and at times – humour. Amongst his many iconic special edition helmets, Lewis Hamilton collaborated with Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama for a chrome-inspired Japanese Grand Prix special in 2023, Valtteri Bottas once ran a pre-season helmet modelled on his own head, and Albon's designs often pay tribute to his pets and his home nation of Thailand.

The 2025 season has also seen plenty of eye-catching limited-edition designs – from bold artistic statements to heartfelt tributes. One standout came from the youngest designer yet, Thea, the young fan behind Carlos Sainz's unofficial mascot “Sparkles” the unicorn. The Spaniard wore Thea's design as a sticker on his helmet for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and, while it was meant as a one-off, after his P3 finish in Baku, there's no wonder he'd want his new mascot to stick around!

While some special edition helmet designs are lighthearted, others carry deep personal significance. One of the best examples of this was Romain Grosjean during his return to the Haas garage for Pirelli tyre testing, where he was finally able to wear the helmet that his children had designed for his planned 2020 farewell race – one he never got to use after his terrifying Bahrain crash.

It was a very sentimental helmet and reaffirmed that special edition helmets can be much more than just a marketing tool when they hold such meaning for the drivers.

Oscar Piastri's Race Engineer, Tom Stallard, and former Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer join the latest episode of F1 Explains to delve into data and discuss how teams and drivers use it to go faster.

When Formula 1 drivers want to go faster, they study squiggly lines on a screen. This is F1 data, showing how drivers accelerate, brake, steer and more. Hidden in the squiggles are the secrets of speed.

From classic actresses to iconic artists, Hollywood went all out to celebrate the spookiest day of the year.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Hollywood loves Halloween, and the stars proved it this year with a wide array of costumes.


	Celebrities went all-out to celebrate the spookiest day of the year, sporting their best costumes by portraying everyone from beloved film characters to music icons. From recreating Kendrick Lamar's 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show look to a fictional Dr. Seuss character, there were no shortage of inventive Halloween looks this year.




	Most celebrities used the holiday to pay homage to various characters from beloved movies, including Mindy Kaling taking on one of her Running Point star Kate Hudson's most popular roles to Ed Sheeran as a classic horror icon.

Morning and daytime talk show hosts didn't shy away from creative costume choices as well, with Today show hosts Savannah Guthrie and Jenna Bush Hager respectively dressing up as Miranda Priestly and Anna Wintour, while Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos dressed up in several ensembles, including as Labubus and Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, on Live! With Kelly and Mark's annual Halloween extravaganza.

	The Queen of Halloween, too, stepped out this year for her annual bash. For Halloween 2025, Heidi Klum dressed up as Medusa, sporting a headpiece of moving snakes, fangs and a forked tongue, accompanied by a massive snake-like bodysuit and tail. 


	Read on for the best celebrity Halloween costumes of 2025, worn by stars including Lady Gaga, Niecy Nash-Betts, KeKe Palmer and more.

	











	Lady Gaga's 2025 Halloween costume referenced one of her newest tracks from her seventh studio album Mayhem. The Grammy winner dressed up as the Garden of Eden and its gardener, which is one of the titles from her most recent record.


	“Happy Halloween to all the grave diggers,” she wrote on Instagram, concluding, “love, Mother Monster.”

	Niecy Nash-Betts and her wife Jessica Betts honored Kendrick Lamar's 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show performance by portraying the rapper and Serena Williams, respectively. The All's Fair star took on the role of the tennis legend, while Betts sported a pair of bootcut jeans and a blue jacket, matching Lamar's outfit from the performance. 


	In their joint Instagram post showing off the look, both Niecy and Betts took turns replicating Williams and Lamar's viral moves from the most recent Super Bowl.

Keke Palmer and her son teamed up for an adorable mother-son costume as Snoop Dogg and Bow Wow. The duo replicated their looks from the “Bow Wow (That's My Name)” music video, which was released 25 years ago.

	A frequent Halloween costume stunner, Janelle Monáe dressed up as the fictional Cat in the Hat this year. Equipped with full prosthetics, the Grammy-nominated singer posted various photos and video clips of her portraying the Dr. Seuss character. 

	










A post shared by Janelle Monáe (@janellemonae)


	Julia Fox's Halloween costume faced backlash as she dressed up as a bloody Jackie Kennedy Onassis. The look mirrored the outfit the former first lady wore when her husband, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated. Fox defended the look on Instagram, where she wrote that she dressed up as Jackie “not as a costume, but as a statement.” 


	“The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history,” she added. “Her decision not to change clothes, even after being encouraged to, was an act of extraordinary bravery. It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It's about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance” 

A post shared by Julia Fox (@juliafox)


	Mindy Kaling thanked her Running Point star Kate Hudson “for inventing yellow” in her 2025 Halloween Instagram post, where she dressed up as Hudson's character from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She wore an outfit similar to Andie Anderson's silky yellow dress paired with a blonde wig in the video, as Hudson complimented the look in her comment section, writing, “Ahhhh! Hahaha! Yes!!!”

A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling)


	The “Shape of You” singer went full horror this year as Pennywise from It. Ed Sheeran was unrecognizable dressed up as the killer clown, sharing a series of photos and videos of him strolling around New York City. 

	











	“In for a Penny,” he wrote in the caption of the Instagram post.

Just like Halloween 2024, Paris Hilton wore an array of costumes to celebrate the holiday. Dressing up with her husband and two kids, the Hilton household went as the cast of Toy Story in one Instagram post and the stars of Peter Pan in another. 

A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton)


	As for her solo looks, Hilton paid homage to Michelle Pfeiffer in a recreation of her Catwoman character from Tim Burton's Batman Returns. She also “started off #Halloweek” with a homage to the princess of pop, Britney Spears, with her signature red latex outfit from the Oops!… I Did It Again music video.

Coco Jones paid tribute to the Oscar-winning film Dreamgirls this Halloween, with a recreation of one of the film's iconic posters featuring stars Jennifer Hudson, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and Anika Noni Rose.

A post shared by Coco Jones (@cocojones)


	Girl group KATSEYE poked fun at their viral moment on the red carpet at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards, where they were asked which of Mariah Carey's music videos was their favorite, and they seemingly had no answers. This Halloween, they dressed up as varying looks from Carey's music videos and did a separate social post where they each recreated Carey's Rainbow album cover look.

do you ever get tired of serving so hard??? #KATSEYE

The Erin Foster phenom's issue isn't offensiveness. It's using Judaism as a hood ornament.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	About 20 years ago, when Six Feet Under ruled the prestige-TV roost, a casual moment unfolded in which the secular Jewish Brenda talked with her mother about her late father's relationships. The father and his brother did not get along, the mother explained, because one could not forgive the other for “giving up Chanukah.”


	Even my younger, less-formed self thought that line was funny, because, while Chanukah is a lovely holiday, it is not so central that its neglect could be a euphemism for assimilation. In fact, Chanukah is the one holiday that even many highly assimilated Jews celebrate.

	This was a small moment in a much bigger show that had nothing to do with Judaism. So I just laughed it off; it was far from the first or last time a TV show bungled a nuance of the Jewish (or any other) tradition. Points for trying; let's move on.




			Related Video		







	That would normally have been my response to a moment early in the recently released second season of Erin Foster's Nobody Wants This, when Seth Rogen, as some corners of the Internet made mockingly clear, mistook Tu B'Shvat for Tisha B'av — when he called the saddest day of the Jewish year by the name of the birthday of trees. Rogen's rabbi is proudly unconcerned with the details, so it could have been a comic mistake from the character as he was talking to Adam Brody's more idealistic clergyman, lead character Noah Roklov. But Roklov doesn't correct him and the whole thing just seems like an unfortunate production blunder. (Netflix curiously could still just overdub the two words, but another matter.)

	











	I might have again had the Brenda reaction — “points for trying, let's move on.” But this was a smaller moment in a much bigger show that has everything to do with Judaism. And sadly that moment epitomizes so much of what I think Nobody Wants This troublingly gets wrong.


	Much has been made about the caricatured depictions in the first season of the Netflix series about the relationship between Noah and the non-Jewish Joanne (Kristen Bell), with Noah's sister-in-law Esther and mother Bina coming right out of an old-time ethnic joke book. Esther becomes more dimensional this season; Bina, ever the cartoon villain, does not. But that's not the show's biggest problem. The main issue with Nobody Wants This is that it does not seem especially interested in the very Judaism it purports to be about — and worse, seems too often to suggest that there's not even much to be interested in.


	Like many religions, Judaism can provide moral grounding, community bonding, daily meaning and, at its most elevated, an awareness of and engagement with the divine. You'd never know it from watching Nobody Wants This, where it mainly seems like a way for family members to be suspicious of each other (Bina especially, vis-à-vis Joanne).


	Two of the more promising moments — the kind that made me sit up and think we were actually going to get a full-blooded exploration of tradition — both fizzled into deracinated nothingness. An on-screen Purim party, which, despite 2,500 years of tradition that varies greatly by region, contains barely a single moment that has anything to do with the holiday, just becoming a Halloween party like so many others happening this weekend. And a “brit bat,” a daughter-naming tradition that has emerged as part of a gender-equity movement alongside the bris, teases you with talk about Ashkenazi naming traditions — but then its main takeaway becomes that Jews having babies live in very opulent houses and give ridiculously hippie names. (Seriously, who calls a baby “Afternoon”?)

	











	Also, sorry, but in what world do Jews gather in a room in the last two years and not once mention, let alone debate, October 7, Gaza, Israel or hostages? In the real world unaffiliated Jews are discovering roots, asking questions, evolving beliefs, grappling with worldviews. My own synagogue has at least three new attendees currently doing just that. Yet in Nobody-world the main expression of Judaism for anyone who isn't the rabbi is the donning of a “Matzah Baller” jersey. It's not just cringe — it's out of date.


	Each episode of Nobody Wants This contains nothing offensive per se, by which I mean there's no awful slur or (those Bina and Esther depictions aside) horribly crude stereotype. (Let's not mention the first-season scene of Bina surreptitiously shoveling prosciutto in her mouth.) But the combined picture is nonetheless a dispiriting one, a vision of Jews who are celebrated only by how much they seem like everyone else — and not all by how much they're like themselves. When you make a show about a rabbi for whom customs and commandments are supposedly very important, you would seem to have a bigger responsibility to show traditional Judaism for what it is. And Foster's series, while often delightful and even moving, flubs the job.


	Getting Tu'B'shvat and Tisha B'Av mixed up is not the biggest deal. Yet it still makes it hard to take a show about representation seriously. Could you imagine black-ish confusing Martin Luther King and Martin Luther? When you don't seem to be that interested in what the icons mean, everything starts to feel like a gesture.

	











	Foster seems excited by how fun she made one of the lead characters, and uses it as a defense against charges of stereotyping — “[Y]ou have a rabbi as the lead. A hot, cool, young rabbi who smokes weed,” she told the LA Times, defensively — seemingly unaware that the best argument for how dimensionally you portray a tradition is not by how much the people leading it are like anyone else. This is Judaism as hood ornament, elements dropped in to make you feel like something is being explored but in a show that has zero interest in actually doing the work. I know writers talked to a rabbi as a consultant, but it's not clear from watching the show how much they asked about or listened to what they said.


	The Noah character is an idealist, and the show does have moments when it actually seems to grasp something about affiliated Judaism; when he explains to Joanne how Jews like to ask questions from all sides, he really does catch a quality embedded deep within the tradition. But those moments are too few and far between, replaced instead by Judaism as something that mainly exists to stop you from being with your boyfriend. Even Noah's idealism seems cut-and-pasted from another, more generic show. This may sound crazy but a few times this season Noah reminded me of E From Entourage, futilely trying to hold the line on idealism while everyone just tells him to get over it. 


	We've certainly come a long way from the Judaism in that show, which was mainly limited to Ari sneaking away to make calls on Yom Kippur. But when your biggest step forward evokes Vince and Johnny Drama, you may not have come as far as you think.

	











	What kills me is that there are stakes and substance to the central relationship here; Nobody Wants This is more than just a guilty pleasure. Based partly on Foster's own life, this is a show smart enough to insightfully engage with all kinds of issues — marriage, career, siblings, even real estate. Yet somehow it can't spare any of that thoughtfulness for Judaism. As my colleague Daniel Fienberg recently wrote, Joanne and her sister in the first season possessed “a lack of knowledge or curiosity about Jewishness” to the point that it even “frequently resembled playful antisemitism.”


	Taken on its own this would be uncomfortable enough, a supposed step forward for representation that actually sets it back — a Netflix hit that six years after Shtisel burned up the platform reverts us to a world in which many Jewish people have seemingly little allegiance to tradition and are accorded no depth to their faith. (Netflix was also the home of the hilariously caricaturish Unorthodox and My Unorthodox Life, so make of that what you will.) 


	But this isn't about just one representational botching. Sociocultural shows never drop into a vacuum, and Nobody Wants This arrives in a world where Jewish identity has been completely transformed, even before October 7 but certainly after. Look no further than the reaction to Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunning mayoral candidate of the country's biggest city and my own hometown, who has become a divisive figure in the Jewish community for his views on Israel. Mamdani has tried to calm the fires by talking about his planned police budget and hate-crime vigilance. But I can't help feeling like he's missing the point. Millions of Jewish New Yorkers identify with Israel, the place where nearly half of the world's Jews now live, and have felt at home in New York precisely because of the bond between the places. The potential future leader of their city saying Israel shouldn't be a Jewish state can't but make them feel, at a very deep primordial level, they might not really be welcome in New York either.

	











	What gnaws about Mamdani is the existential discomfort of not feeling at home in one's home, which is the kind of thing that can't be addressed by budget allocation. His mistake is, in many ways, the same as Foster's — in thinking Jewish representation and solidarity is about box-checking, not about an attempt at genuine understanding.


	I know, I know, Nobody Wants This is just meant to be “entertaining,” as a colleague of mine said when we were hashing this out. But somehow that doesn't feel good enough. A show like blackish could have used that defense but never did, instead examining issues the Black community was going through with regular rigor while never sacrificing the comedy. You can choose not to do that in the first mainstream sitcom about a traditional Jewish person in decades, I suppose. But then you're tokenizing and emptily trading on a faith and even missing an opportunity. This is the one chance many people will have to learn about Jewish tradition. And they come away knowing the thing they mainly knew before — it stops non-Jewish women and Jewish men from getting married.


	Earlier this month the last of the alive Israeli hostages returned home from Gaza. The videos spreading across social media of Jews reuniting with their families, often with effusions of Jewish prayer — secular and religious, young and old, Ashkenazi and Sephardi — filled so many Jews  (and plenty of non-Jews) with joy. For a brief moment our screens were awash with the kind of positive expressions of Jewish identity one too rarely sees on media platforms, giving a glimpse at the kind of respectfulness of purpose Nobody Wants This could have aimed for but too frequently chooses to avoid.

	











	Late in this new season, when Sasha asks Noah while they're playing ball if he would choose Judaism if he wasn't born into it, the show seems tantalizingly, refreshingly, on the cusp of actually diving into questions that a show about representation purports to care about. But then Sasha hoists up a shot, makes a joke and the scene ends, no answers given. Instead, you're left wondering about a different question, one I found myself mentally asking again and again watching this season: why would a TV show go out of its way to focus on a religion in which it has such evidently little interest?

Although the K-pop giant gained approximately $1.5 billion in market value, music stocks were unchanged in the week ended Oct. 31, 2025.

	Glenn Peoples



	HYBE shares soared 18.4% in the week ended Oct. 31 after a South Korean court ruled that K-pop group NewJeans may not leave HYBE imprint ADOR and make music under a different name. The five members of the girl group had attempted to break away from HYBE after the K-pop giant dismissed NewJeans' mentor, ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin, in April 2024.


	Rather than lose NewJeans — which would have created additional headaches for HYBE and other K-pop companies — ADOR will retain the group through the end of its exclusive contract in 2029. The fact that Min is no longer at ADOR didn't sway the court. “Merely the fact that NewJeans personally places high trust in Min Hee-jin does not make guaranteeing her the position of ADOR's CEO a significant obligation under the exclusive contract,” according to a report. The ruling added approximately $1.5 billion to HYBE's market value, suggesting that investors were fearful a court loss would spill over to other acts currently under contract with HYBE. 


	Despite HYBE's considerable gain, the 19-company Billboard Global Music Index was unchanged at 2,845.53. Music stocks were almost evenly mixed between winners and losers, and only two companies had either a gain or a loss in excess of 10%. 


	Music stocks lagged behind major indexes' gains. In the U.S., the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.2% to 23,724.96 and the S&P 500 improved 0.7% to 6,840.20. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.7% to 9,717.25. South Korea's KOSPI composite index jumped 4.2% to 4,107.50 on AI optimism after Samsung announced it would build a semiconductor factory in partnership with American company Nvidia. China's Shanghai Composite Index ticked upward 0.1% to 3,954.79. 


	SiriusXM shares finished the week up 1.4% to $21.69 after a see-saw end to the week. The stock gained 10.1% on Thursday (Oct. 30) after the company's third-quarter results, but fell 6.5% on Friday (Oct. 31). The bump in share price came after SiriusXM increased its full-year forecasts for revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. The Q3 results also showed that the satellite radio company, which also owns streaming platform Pandora, turned a net loss into a net profit. 


	Universal Music Group shares fell 2.3% to 23.27 euros ($26.99) despite gaining 1% on Friday after the company reported solid Q3 earnings following the close of trading on Thursday. Following the results, J.P. Morgan reiterated its “overweight” rating and 39.00 euros ($45.23) price target while Guggenheim maintained its “neutral” rating and eliminated its price target, which was previously 27.00 euros ($31.32). 


	Spotify's stock benefited from news that the company is raising prices in the U.K., finishing the week up 1.5% to $655.32. That modest gain helped Spotify reclaim some of the loss it suffered after the share price dropped 4.1% on Oct. 24. The Stockholm-based company will report Q3 earnings on Tuesday (Nov. 4). 


	Radio giant iHeartMedia was the week's biggest loser after dropping 12.4% to $2.97. The company's share price has been on a roll lately, though, gaining 39.4% in 2025. iHeartMedia will release Q3 earnings on Nov. 10.


	Most live music stocks lost ground. Live Nation fell 2.2% to $149.53 ahead of its earnings results on Tuesday. German promoter CTS Eventim dropped 2.9% to 77.60 euros ($90.00). MSG Entertainment dipped 3.5% to $44.16. Sphere Entertainment Co. was an exception, rising 1.7% to $68.48.

Liam Gallagher has called out a fan who launched flares into the crowd during Oasis' opening Australian tour stop at Melbourne's Marvel Stadium on Friday night (Nov. 1), describing the individual as a “seriously f**ked up” person in a profanity-laced post on social media.

	One concertgoer told Australian outlet news.com.au that the flares sparked visible flashes among the crowd. “Each time you saw this flash, it looked like a fire, and then it was contained fairly quickly,” said Virginia, who attended the show with her 13-year-old daughter. The pair exited the venue early due to safety concerns.

	











	Security reportedly conducted thorough bag checks at the gate, though it remains unclear how the flares entered the venue or whether any injuries occurred. Marvel Stadium has yet to comment.




	Gallagher, never one to mince words, addressed the flare-thrower directly on Saturday morning.


	“To the massive C*** who launched that flare into the crowd last night at the gig in Melbourne you are 1 seriously f***ed up individual and you will get yours trust me,” the singer he wrote on X. 


	During the performance, fans say Liam was visibly displeased, reportedly wagging his finger and mouthing “naughty, naughty” from the stage. His brother Noel Gallagher appeared concerned, though the band did not stop the performance. It is unclear if there were any injuries as a result of the incident.


	The Melbourne concert marked the first show of Oasis‘ long-awaited Live 25 reunion tour Down Under. The group is scheduled to play three shows at Marvel Stadium before heading to Sydney's Accor Stadium for two nights.


	Before taking the stage, Liam greeted fans with, “G'day Australia! Did you miss us? Because we missed you!” The sold-out show drew massive crowds, with fans queuing from 5 a.m. to secure front-row spots and breaking into spontaneous singalongs outside the venue.


	The Live 25 tour sees Noel and Liam Gallagher reuniting alongside Gem Archer, Andy Bell, and drummer Joey Waronker. Mike Moore is filling in for original guitarist Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs, who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


UPDATE SATURDAY AM: The lowest October in 27 years is coming to a close with the lowest weekend of the year at around $49M, no thanks to Halloween falling on a Friday, but the horror doesn't stop there: Anyone expecting a boost for business today has to deal with the final World Series game between LA Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays.


	Comscore reported earlier this week that October was coming in at $440M, which is the lowest October has ever seen since 1998, which did $455.5M. The biggest October ever belongs to 2018, which did $832.8M — there were three tentpoles that month with Venom, A Star Is Born and Halloween, which combined, did some $481M for the month alone. October 2024 brought in $478M, this past month being -8% off from that. The biggest October post-pandemic belongs to 2021, when moviegoers were coming back from Covid, and the month was stacked with Dune, No Time to Die and Venom 2, that frame amounting to $645M. After surprises such as Conjuring: Last Rites and Demon Slayer Infinity Castle in September, October dragged the fall box office behind per Comscore with $1 billion for the post Labor Day through Oct. 30 period, -2.2% behind the same period a year ago. On the plus side, the 2025 box office for Jan. 1-Oct. 30 is clocking $7 billion, +3% from a year ago, but still -24% from pre-Covid 2019 which grossed $9.26 billion by this point in time.

	











	Universal/Blumhouse's third weekend of Black Phone 2 is leading with $7.6M, -41%, for a running cume of $61M. The scary movie led all titles on Halloween with $2.4M while Focus Features' Bugonia was second with $1.8M. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Meanwhile per industry estimates, because Netflix doesn't report, KPop Demon Hunters at 2,890 theaters grossed $600K yesterday for what's shaping up to be a $3.4M second three-day weekend. As one distribution source predicted about the most watched Netflix title coming back to cinemas: “I don't think there's more juice left in that squeeze.”  


Bugonia, which cost a lot for a Yorgos Lanthimos movie at $45M, with a higher price for what Focus acquired it for, is coming in with the biggest opening for the offbeat filmmaker at $4.4M in its wide break from 17 to 2,043 theaters. The movie gets a B CinemaScore, an 80% positive and a 53% definite recommend in Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak audience exits. Clearly the question raised will be, well, if we took out Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere last weekend, shouldn't we take out Bugonia? They cost a similar amount, with Springsteen opening at $8.8M, and similar exits (Springsteen was B+). But they're two different movies: One is aimed at a hipster arthouse crowd, the other at older fans of a rock icon who didn't show up. If Bugonia can get to a $30M gross and $100M-plus global take, consider it a gross right in Lanthimos' wheelhouse: his Oscar winners The Favourite did $34.3M domestic, $95.9M global, and Poor Things wound up with $34.5M domestic/$117.6M worldwide. Focus is playing the Conclave date of the calendar rather than taking Bugonia out over Thanksgiving or Christmas which is where Searchlight played his previous two awards contenders. Note, Bugonia‘s weekend alone amounts close to the entire domestic run of his previous Searchlight dud, Kinds of Kindness, which only grossed $5M domestic, and $16.4M global in June 2024.


Bugonia played best in the East and the West with 51% of its tickets sales from both coasts versus the 43% norm for all other titles in the marketplace. Male leaning at 61%. 63% in 18-34 (a demo which the specialty distributors should make more movies for). Diversity demos were 53% Caucasian, 24% Latino and Hispanic, 7% Black, 7% Asian American and 6% Native American. The Alamo DC 9 is the top grossing location for the Emma Stone-Jesse Plemmons pic with around $8K.  


	Briarcliff Entertainment has the animated kids spooky pic Stitch Head which did $350K yesterday for what's looking like a $2.2M opening at 2,162. Best areas of play yesterday were South, Midwest and South Central, with standout markets being Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta. The Cinema 10 in Huntsville TX posted the best gross with $1K. Twenty-six reviews from critics amounted to a paltry 69% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. 


	Roadside Attractions has the political thriller Anniversary, starring Diane Lane, Kyle Chandler, Dylan O'Brien, Phoebe Dynevor and Zoey Deutch, about a very close-knit family that is torn apart as a new movement “The Change” envelops the country. Directed and co-written by Jan Komasa, the pic counts 67% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes from 43 reviews, a $72K Friday and forecasted $247K 3-day from 809 theaters or a $305 per theater.


	Saturday estimates:


PREVIOUS FRIDAY MIDDAY: In a weak box office weekend with Halloween festivities stealing audiences away today, Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 will pop back up to No. 1 in its third frame with a $7.6 million take, down 41% from last weekend for a running cume of $61M.


	As we told you earlier, the last time Halloween fell on a Friday was 2014, and a Universal/Blumhouse horror movie ruled then: the second weekend of Ouija, with $10.7M. That title led Halloween Friday with a $3.4M take and then popped by 47% on Saturday with $5M. So goes the hope for all distributors that business comes roaring back on Saturday, but it's not expected to be anything to brag about.

	











	The midday charts right now show a toss-up for the overall weekend for No. 2 between Paramount's feature take on Colleen Hoover's Regretting You and Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man, both estimated around $4.8M. For Chainsaw Man, that's a 73% decline for a running cume of $29.5M. For Regretting You, that reps a 65% decline from its $13.68M opening for a running cume of $24.1M.

	However, Netflix's second go-round of KPop Demon Hunters could upset them both with a $5M+ take, that number not made official in midday forecasts. While the movie posted a two-day $19M No. 1 finish back in August in a wide release sans No. 1 chain AMC Theatres, this time around the Kansas-based circuit will be playing the Sony anime production along with Regal and Cinemark.


Bugonia, Focus Features' wide break of Yorgos Lanthimos' fifth collaboration with Emma Stone, is eyeing a $4M second weekend after jumping from 17 theaters in NY/LA/Austin last weekend to 2,043. That's the biggest wide weekend ever for the Oscar-winning Greek filmmaker, his previous high being the eighth weekend of Poor Things, which cleared $2.9M in 2023. The new pic's second Friday of $1.7M includes $700,000 in previews from 1,700 theaters.


	Note that preview figure is ahead of Conclave‘s Thursday previews of $500K a year ago, which posted a $6.6M opening at 1,753 theaters, And it's not far from Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme, whose wide-break Thursday previews did $850K during the summer; that wide weekend — its second frame — posted $6.27M at 1,678. There is hope for the long haul on Bugonia based on its 87% with critics and 89% with audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. Lanthimos' Oscar-winning Poor Things was 92% certified fresh with critics and 80% with audiences, while his other Academy Award-winning The Favourite was 93% certified fresh and 71% with audiences in 2018.

	Universal's re-release of Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future at 2,290, with the boost of Imax, is looking at a Friday of $1.55M, which includes $650K previews from last night in what's shaping up to be a $3.8M three-day total. This is the 40th anniversary reissue of the blockbuster starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. By comparison, Uni's re-release of Jaws for its 50th anniversary posted a three-day of $8.2M over Labor Day weekend.


	Disney is hoping for a $4M+ second weekend on Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, but rivals see the Jeremy Allen White-led pic lower. At that level, it's a 55% decline with a $16.4M running cume by EOD Sunday.


	After making $1.55M with the reissue of 2008's Twilight, Fathom Entertainment's re-release of that pic's 2009 sequel The Twilight Saga: New Moon did $590K at 1,504 theaters Thursday night. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse plays today, followed by Breaking Dawn Part 1 on Saturday and Breaking Dawn Part 2 on Sunday. The re-release of the Summit/Lionsgate franchise is in celebration of the novel's 20th anniversary.

Here in Germany Frankenstein isn't getting a limited release in cinemas.
Otherwise it may have boosted the numbers.

Can't wait to watch Predator Badlands next thursday and the Running Man the week after that.

Too bad del Toro's new Frankenstein didn't get a real release… It's fabulous and it would have been a huge hit for Halloween weekend.

Exactly. At the very least it should have had a brief but wide run like GLASS ONION had.

Bugonia deserves the hype it has earned 100% imo. I was never a massive fan of the director's cinema but between this and Poor Things two years ago he won me over and then some. Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons are nothing sort of astonishing here and the film is delightfully twisted and surprisingly entertaining from start to finish. Highly recommended

I agree, Kyle.
Bugonia is the best movie i saw in a theater this year. So far i have seen 120.

Associate Editor


	As HBO and returning showrunner Issa López gear up for another season of True Detective, Woody Harrelson is retiring Det. Marty Hart.


	The 3x Oscar nominee recently shut down hopes that he will reunite with Season 1 co-star and longtime pal Matthew McConaughey for another round of the prestige anthology crime drama after they launched the show in 2014.


	“Matthew's so funny In fairness, never. No chance,” he said on 3rd Hour of Today after McConaughey teased the possiblity.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Because it turned out great,” added Harrelson. I love that it turned out the way it did, and if anything, doing another season would, I think, tarnish that.”

	











	Created by Nic Pizzolatto, Season 1 of True Detective followed Detectives Marty Hart and Rust Cohle (McConaughey) as they investigate the murder of Dora Lange from 1995 to 2002, before new evidence forces them to revisit the case 10 years later as it may be connected to a series of unsolved murders.


	After Pizzolatto said that both actors were “open” to reprising their roles and he has “another story” in mind for them, McConaughey said they were “keen on the idea but it's nothing more than an idea.”


	“If Nic puts something on paper that Woody and I think is good enough, it wouldn't even be a choice,” he told NME. “We would look at it and go, ‘it must happen.' It's gotta be damn good though because we set a pretty good precedent!”


	Meanwhile, Harrelson noted he and McConaughey are teaming up for another project. “This is a comedy, half-hour, and hopefully people dig it,” he said.

Funny, because HBO said the same thing when it came to working with Pizzolatto again.

Smarter to bring back Jodi Foster, she was awesome and so was the setting and her partner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Junichi Okada & Michihito Fujii Talk Netflix's 'Last Samurai Standing': Streaming Is The 'Place To Experiment'","https://deadline.com/2025/11/last-samurai-standing-netflix-junichi-okada-michihito-fujii-1236601150/","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 10:02:00 GMT","


					By Sara Merican 




	Billed as Netflix Japan‘s tentpole title for the year, Last Samurai Standing is set in 1878 Japan, and assembles 292 fallen samurais for a survival game, where the last competitor standing gets to claim a 100 billion yen (nearly $656M) prize.


	Japan's Junichi Okada, formerly of boyband V6, stars as the lead actor in the series, while also juggling producer and action choreographer duties. 


	Alongside Okada, writer-director Michihito Fujii (The Journalist, Faceless) helms the series. Both worked together on the film, Hard Days, in 2023.

	Okada was initially approached by Netflix to produce a series together — one that would involve “updating” the period piece for contemporary tastes. Okada agreed, on the condition that he could choose some of the people he would work with, including peers like Fujii.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Fujii added that he and Okada admired the late legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa (Rashomon, Seven Samurai) and wanted to pay homage to his works, through Last Samurai Standing. 


	He also acknowledged that 2024 series Shogun has also cultivated global interest in samurais and Japanese history, and he is excited for Last Samurai Standing to seize this cultural moment when it premieres on Netflix on November 13. 


	“I wanted to work together with Fujii-san, paying respect to the culture of the period piece, but at the same time, take on the challenge of updating the period piece. In my forties, this is something that I really want to dedicate my time to,” says Fujii. 

	











Making a period piece for the present


	Okada also looks back at his previous singing career in a boyband and says, “There was a song called ‘Made in Japan' which I debuted to when I was 16. Even when I became an actor, I continue to think that way, wanting to create something that is ‘made in Japan.'”


	He links that ambition to what he is currently doing with Last Samurai Standing, and said that he is proud that he can put Japanese culture and history — like the stories of samurais — on the world map.


	Adapted from the novel, “Ikusagami,” by Shogo Imamura, Last Samurai Standing picks up in the Meiji period in Japan, in 1878, where the samurais experienced a sharp decline in their status. For centuries, the sword-wielding samurai were the ruling warrior class in Japan's feudal society, and seen as military elites and cultural icons. 


	Under Japan's new modernization laws, samurai were banned from carrying swords and become an increasingly impoverished and forgotten class of a vanished era. A mysterious invitation begins to circulate, and 292 samurai gather at the Tenryu-ji temple for a tournament, in the hopes of winning the massive cash prize.


	Fujii was particularly drawn to the story of the samurais' waning influence in society and said that there are parallels to the present, in how the pandemic and now, AI, have fundamentally changed the importance of some professions. He wanted to ask a question through the series: who are the samurais of today?


	Fujii says: “I realized that what can make the story more interesting, even thought it is set in the Meiji period, is for it to be seen as not just a story that took place a long time ago, but for people to see it as their own story, in this current period. I wanted to have the young audience watching this to not see it as something that's old.”


	Looking at the landscape of film, television and streaming, Fujii emphasizes that streaming is a “place to experiment.


	“TV dramas have been there before I was born, and film has a long-standing history. The only media that has been created after I was born is the streaming platform,” says Fujii. “What's most interesting about streaming media is that this is the place to experiment.”


Producing realistic action


	Multi-hyphenate Okada said that while he was originally slated to join just as a producer, he was soon asked to lead the action choreography too, given his extensive experience in various martial arts, including jiu-jitsu, jeet kune do and shooto, among others. 


	“They asked me, you're also going to be part of this as an actor, right? So I said yes, although I wasn't so sure if I could do both producing and acting together,” said Okada. “I have done the roles of action choreographer and actor, but not the role of producer, with being a lead actor. But I decided to just jump in and try.”


	Okada plays the role of Shujiro Saga, a once-feared legendary assassin who ends up joining the deadly game in the hopes of earning money to save his ailing wife and child.


	Hideaki Ito (Umizaru), Kazunari Ninomiya (from J-pop boy group Arashi), actress Kaya Kiyohara (Love is for the Dogs), and Yumia Fujisaki (The Parades) are also part of the cast.


	One perk that Okada enjoyed, for wearing so many hats? He could greenlight a lot of his stunts — ones that a producer might have stopped for being too risky or expensive.


	“One thing that was positive of doing all three roles, is that even if it's seen as dangerous and not able to be done, I'm able to get rid of that, as other people do not need to take the responsibility. For example, normally they'll ask, ‘What about the insurance?' Nobody can take the responsibility, so these risks tend to get stopped. But if you are the producer, I said, ‘well, Okada wants to do it, so let's do it' and we managed to realize many situations.”

	











	Okada adds that they were able to also work with longer takes, as he did most of his own stunt work, drawing from his 20-year-long career in the film industry. He wanted to use as much real action craft on set as possible, and minimize the amount of VFX needed.


	“Since I'm the person doing the action and stunts, we can do the long take,” says Okada. “I do have a huge respect for stunt people, but then you have to shoot from the back to hide things.”


	Fujii picks out the night-time assembly of 292 samurais in the first episode as the most complex scene that he had to direct.


	All of the samurais were real actors — none were created through visual effects. 


	“For the crew, this was really challenging, and we spent about three weeks to arrange this shoot, in the middle of winter,” says Okada. “To have a rehearsal of 300 people was not possible, so we had an action team of 20 people, and make sure we are in completely alignment in what was going to happen, and then we called the actors. We arranged them in smaller groups, from group, A, B, C, all the way to G, and then we put them into the action scene.


	“For example, we would say that group A would have a certain kind of energy, and then the B group would have to cross over. Then the C team would have to fight over here,” adds Okada. “There were a lot of minute calculations, with the people in the background to create such movements.”


Sources of inspiration


	Besides Akira Kurosawa, Okada names Shogun star Hiroyuki Sanada as one of his role models, alongside other bandmates he grew up with. His adolescent years were not easy, and he often had questions about his career and identity. 


	“I didn't have a father and I wondered what kind of man I wanted to grow up to be,” says Okada. “Through group activities, when I was an idol, I also wondered how my career was going to turn out. I was also the youngest, so I always wondered what I needed to say, for other people to listen to what I wanted to do. But since I started when I was 14, I built up a lot of experience, and I put up a lot of other people as my role models. 


	“There were many actors that taught me, when I was an idol, and encouraged me to continue,” adds Okada. 


	Fujii also praises Okada's “childlike-ness” in the way he thinks creatively. 


	“Creators need to have a child-like way of thinking and humor, and I was able to find that [in him],” says Okada. “When we completed, we cried. We were a little bit embarrassed, but I think our friendship has really deepened.”

To mark the end of our week-long spooky season coverage—in which we unpacked the impact of Stephen King's work, as well as discussed R.F. Kuang's Katabasis and talked horror films with Oz Perkins—we thought we'd look back on the lingering effects of certain scary flicks on our minds. So TV critic Saloni Gajjar asked the rest of the A.V. Club staff: What's your most irrational fear inspired by a horror movie?

Our answers range from Kubrick's take on The Shining to a fictional shark attack and gory, unconventional slashers. Now we invite you to contribute your own responses in the comments—and send in some prompts of your own! If you have a pop culture question you'd like us and fellow readers to answer, please email it to [email protected].



I didn't watch a full Final Destination movie until my 20s, but I still managed to develop a debilitating fear of logging trucks from binging grainy death compilations on YouTube when I was a pre-teen, long before I had the guts to press play on the full thing. I couldn't drive, mind you, but I still managed to work myself into a cold sweat whenever my parents would pull up behind one of those infernal vehicles—something that happened quite a bit growing up in New England. I was just starting to get over it when a dude on Supernatural got impaled by a metal rod that had fallen off his own van in pretty much the same way the cop died by a flying, loose tree trunk in the infamous Final Destination scene. Let's just say I'm glad I now live in a city where most of my travel happens underground. [Emma Keates]



I wasn't near the ocean until I was entering high school, so as a landlocked kid, my family's summer vacations in Michigan (either near Lake Michigan, which back then felt very oceanlike, or one of the small Sister Lakes, which very much didn't), consisted of two things: Watching Jaws (and What About Bob?, which I'm just realizing as I type this also heavily features madness, an inescapable presence that's driving that madness, and Richard Dreyfuss) and a lot of swimming. I was not a dumb child. (I think.) I knew that a Great White making its way to the shores of South Haven was an absolute impossibility. And yet, swimming into depths over my head? Or, worse still, getting in the water at night, when it's dark and everything? Considering what happened to Chrissie Watkins? Are you nuts? [Tim Lowery]



The shadowy corners of rooms and the darkness under the bed are prime unseen real estate for demon-filled horror movies. Therefore, totally normal to be scared as a kid. But a brightly lit bathroom? If it weren't for seeing Alfred Hitchcock's game-changing horror film when I was way too young, there wouldn't be anything for me to even conceive of worrying about. And yet, for years after I saw it on TV, Psycho ruined showers and their opaque curtains for me—I vividly recall washing my hair as quickly as possible as an elementary schooler so that my eyes were only closed for the briefest of moments, lest I be stabbed to death by my local dead-mother obsessive. I'm not sure why I thought this was a common thing that was worth worrying about, or why I thought it would happen to me in my house rather than in a seedy motel, but that's the power of Hitchcock. Besides, people die all the time in the tub! It just turns out that it's way more likely to be from slipping and falling than being hacked up by a weirdo taxidermist. [Jacob Oller]



As a lifelong horror movie fan, I'm surprised I don't have more irrational phobias (the climax of 2004's Bollywood neo-noir, Ek Hasina Thi, did give me a permanent fear of rats). However, I walked away extremely nervous about elevators after The Shining, scared by what could await behind closed doors. Illogical as it may be, the question “What if I drowned in a rapidly approaching pool of blood?” was scary enough. To add to that, Nora's (Lynda Boyd) beheading in Final Destination 2 and a creepy escape scene in The Silence Of The Lambs compounded my claustrophobia. I'm obviously over it now—although an Evil season two episode almost succeeded at bringing back the phase when I would much rather climb up and down to avoid the possibility of getting trapped, stuck, and possibly killed in a tiny, inescapable space. [Saloni Gajjar]



Look: You know there's not a snake in my toilet right now. I know there's not a snake in my toilet now. I'm 41 years old, and my lifetime tally of toilet snakes is resting comfortably at zero. Does this mean that my brain does not—having apparently internalized the lessons of 2006 meme “thriller” Snakes On A Plane in a way I would have preferred it to have focused on some great, or at least less-toilet-based, works of literature—occasionally raise the question “Hey, what if there's a snake in there?” To which I say: I'm not on trial here, the toilet snakes are. We are, after all, talking about some of the most fang-vulnerable portions of my anatomy, being placed in prime toilet snake range; it only takes one moment of failed vigilance for disaster to strike. [William Hughes]



Like everyone else in this post, I can probably chalk this up to having watched something much too young—but that's an occupational hazard when you grow up with older brothers and a video store with a “three for $5” special on horror movies every Thursday. In any case, seeing at least two adults buried alive in Wes Craven's The Serpent And The Rainbow (there could be more, I haven't rewatched it) convinced me that it was an all-too-common occurrence. The history of premature burials would seem to prove me right, though, which is why I came up with a contingency plan to save me from their fate (look up “safety coffin”). I don't worry about this quite as much now, but I still don't like being underground, even if it's just while riding the train. [Danette Chavez]



The Exorcist should not have worked on me. I am neither spiritual nor religious, and I was also raised Jewish. But that never stopped anyone from being terrified of Catholicism. Seeing The Exorcist at a sleepover has that effect. So began my lifelong fear of being possessed by the devil, something I'm reasonably sure isn't going to happen—but still hesitate to get too cocky about. In hindsight, Regan's (Linda Blair) possession terrified me because it spoke to something that continues to scare me: Losing control of my body. Director William Friedkin took the irrational fear of possession, and he made it frighteningly real, burrowing a worry that I wasn't in control of my actions deep into the anxiety centers of my brain. Decades of recurring nightmares in which I'm wrongfully accused of a crime later, the fear persists. [Matt Schimkowitz]

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Oh dang, we're getting a Keanu Reeves time loop movie","https://www.avclub.com/keanu-reeves-time-loop-movie-shiver-tim-miller","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:13:00 GMT","

As aficionados of the time loop movie concept, we here at The A.V. Club are well aware that a really good cinematic ouroboros requires much more than just a dab hand at goofy montages and a decent understanding of cause and effect: It also relies, extremely heavily, on your leading man or woman. Playing the person who will be the one doing all the looping—and, thus, the only character capable of anything in the way of actual character development and growth—time loop stars carry even more of their film than leads usually do, because audiences are functionally trapped in their existential hell with them. The wrong one can sink even the most clever of ideas.

Which is why we're fascinated to hear that Keanu Reeves is set to get a time loop film of his very own, with THR reporting that Reeves is teaming up with Deadpool director Tim Miller for a new film titled Shiver. Written by Ian Shorr, the film has a juicy premise, centered on “a ne'er-do-well smuggler who finds himself in the middle of a deadly double-cross while on a job in the Caribbean Sea, resulting in him surrounded by bodies, hostile mercenaries and thirsty sharks alike. He next finds himself a deathly time loop and scrambling to break the cycle.”

We'll be honest here: Action movies built from the loop template can be a bit of a hard sell. (Look, for instance, to Frank Grillo and Mel Gibson's Boss Level, which leaned in very hard on the video game-y-ness of it all, and wore out its welcome pretty quick.) But if there's one guy who could get us to buy into the premise (besides Tom Cruise, who made a pretty dang good one a few years back), it's Reeves.

We're maybe a bit less sold, though, on Miller, who came up as a VFX artist, and has mostly worked in animation in recent years. (He was supposed to direct Deadpool 2, but reportedly had a falling out with Ryan Reynolds; his only other live-action directing job was the unsuccessful Terminator revival Dark Fate.) Reeves previously worked with Miller on a mid-tier episode of his not especially good video game short film anthology show Secret Level, which apparently went well enough for the two to collaborate again.

Warner Bros. is apparently in “final negotiations” to produce Shiver, which is being executive produced by Kingsman guy Matthew Vaughn.

In a bit of back-and-forth that wouldn't have felt all that out-of-place coming from Rust Cohle and Marty Hart themselves, Woody Harrelson has shot down his old buddy Matthew McConaughey's optimistic dreams of possibly returning to the True Detective franchise one of these days. Harrelson was (per People) talking to NBC's Today about his upcoming return to the Now You See Me franchise, when he was asked about comments McConaughey has made about how the right script (and Harrelson's involvement) might convince him to give the ol' flat circle another spin. To which Harrelson responded, “Matthew's so funny, but in fairness, never. Not a chance.”

Harrelson, understandably, is of the opinion that the first season of True Detective isn't something that he and McConaughey can just recreate on a whim. (Certainly, the show itself has wrestled with that legacy, to varying degrees of success, in the years since we were all losing our minds about Carcosa and flashy no-cut action sequences back in 2014.) “It turned out great,” Harrelson said of his season. “I love that it turned out the way it did. If anything, doing another season would, I think, tarnish that.” (Meanwhile, McConaughey—who's been in a stepped-back mode re: Hollywood for a couple of years—has occasionally tried to at least ostensibly tap into the greatness again, notably with frequent and so-far failed attempts to get a new project off the ground with series creator Nic Pizzolatto.)

Of course, that doesn't mean Harrelson has closed the door on doing anything with McConaughey, as connoisseurs of the duo's current collaborative project well know: The pair has been working for years on a half-hour comedy project about them and their families living together on McConaughey's Texas ranch, reportedly titled Brother From Another Mother. Last we'd heard, that show had been taken down by that old bugbear “creative differences,” after showrunner David West Read departed the project over disagreements about how the comedy series should end. But Harrelson still alluded to it in the Today interview, saying, “We are doing something together and this is a comedy, half-hour, and hopefully people dig it,” so perhaps hope springs eternal for those of us weirdly fixated, not on gritty, eldritch-adjacent crimes, but on these two men's very odd sitcom dreams.

[This contains spoilers for The Witcher season four.]

Within the first minute of The Witcher season four—literally 58 seconds after hitting play—Geralt Of Rivia has already leapt from the fronds of some godforsaken swamp into the roaring maw of a monster. Clearly, he's keeping busy. Saddled with bad vibes since Henry Cavill left for greener pastures before it could drop season three, Netflix wants us to know that while Geralt suddenly looks different, the machinery of The Witcher is still clanging along. This season is so eager to gloss over Cavill's departure that it doesn't even bother with a glimpse of the new guy before chucking him into the fray. What these first frantic seconds show us is not a star, but a brand: the leather, the sword, the vials of potion, and, crucially, that wolf's head medallion. Geralt, we're being told, is the core of Netflix's The Witcher. Who plays him is incidental.

That confidence evaporates almost immediately. The premiere, tellingly dubbed “What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger,” reveals just how defensive the show is about who fleshes out Geralt's story. Recapped by a wide-eyed little girl in the episode's earliest moments, the major beats we've already seen from Geralt's life—his reunion with surrogate daughter Ciri (Freya Allan), his tempestuous romance with sorceress Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), his battle with the warlock Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu)—have been reshot with a new face under that silver mane: Liam Hemsworth. The Witcher, realizing the perceived messiness of recasting its lead at the latter end of its five-season run, wants to both reassert itself and start fresh, which explains this deliberate, brute-force attempt to erase Cavill from our minds. Nothing has changed! Sure thing.

The Witcher shouldn't have gone to the trouble; its Geralt has always been more of a vessel than a character. Cavill carved out a hulking space for himself to grunt and smolder on the periphery of the series' main questline, and only occasionally chopped man and monster alike into mincemeat. Emotions? Ha—The Witcher has rarely dwelled too long on Geralt's feelings and desires, even if they drive the story. Showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich's ensemble approach is much more interested in the world beyond him, like the courtly intrigues of Emperor Emhyr (Bart Edwards) or King Radovid (Hugh Skinner), Yennefer's shifting hierarchy of sorceresses, or the wars that shape Andrzej Sapkowski's famously murky Continent. The series doesn't suddenly shift its focus to Geralt just to accommodate its new (and presumably less fussy) leading man, and it shouldn't. The core of The Witcher, for better or worse, is its trinity—Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri—and they continue to keep the series from crumbling under its own weight.

It's when the series zooms out to include kings, warlocks, mages, and other whatnots that the show diffuses to the point of nothingness. Grasping the breadth of a well-established fantasy world is a challenge for any TV show, but harnessing Sapkowski's sardonic, elliptical scope and endless parade of characters has proven especially onerous for a series that has never quite decided what kind of dark fantasy series it wants to be. Bawdy and violent like HBO's Game Of Thrones, lore-dense and cryptic like The Rings Of Power, both, or its own freaky thing? An identity has never been adequately realized. This season of The Witcher, however, sets an endgame into motion. Recognizing that the Cavill-Hemsworth switcheroo will dominate every conversation about it from here to the White Frost, it has entered crisis mode, smoothing out plodding story arcs, establishing a clear us-versus-them narrative between Vilgefortz and the rest of the Continent, and beefing up its cast with character actors who can stabilize a show prone to drifting.

Supporting Hemsworth's debut is Laurence Fishburne's Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy (Regis for short), a barber-surgeon in the Sweeney Todd mold whose bleak vampiric history is recounted in animation during the season's most vivid and confidently produced episode, “The Joy Of Cooking.” Fishburne, adopting a vague Euro-English accent, is in Morpheus mode here, offering gravelly wisdom to a hero whose loss of agency (or, rather, his silver sword and a wound he's incurred along The Path that stymies him) is compounded by the revelation that Emyhr intends to wed (and bed) Ciri. On the subject of Nilfgaard, James Purefoy displays a mix of world-weariness, menace, and charm as Emyhr's Baelish-coded spy/royal vizier Stefan Skellen, while Sharlto Copley stalks the season's perimeter as the bounty hunter Leo Bonhart, a killer who's hungry for blood and has a taste for witchers. Each of them adds spice to a series long since been rendered bland by the fantasy tropes it haphazardly employs. Whenever they're on screen (especially Copley, who brings a wild, almost alien energy to the show), The Witcher roars to life.

These positives fade quickly. The season takes a dreary turn as Ciri's youthful revolt lands her with the misfit outlaw gang The Rats, where she shares lusty smooches with Mistle (Christelle Elwin), a thief who shows her what it means to live as they engage in all sorts of performative rebellion. What are they rebelling against? Who knows: The Rats are your typical ragtag fantasy crew, drug-fueled, quippy, and burdened with personal tragic backstories that serve vague narrative purposes. Their scenes are hard to watch, like a streaming Dungeons & Dragons campaign of cool nerds who vape and swear collegiately. Allan and her supporting cast do what they can with the flimsy material—Asse (Connor Crawford) is especially striking with a haunted gaze that hints at sadness the show barely acknowledges. Individually, they serve a crucial function in Ciri's still-evolving story; collectively, they're an additional suite of characters in an already overstuffed cast.

Then there's Vilgefortz, who has finally ascended to the series' ultimate heavy. Hissrich frames him as a composite of other familiar genre tyrants, like Emperor Palpatine (whom Vilgefortz all but plagiarizes during the Hemsworth-less sixth episode), and, most obviously, Voldemort, not just in his story omnipresence, but in the goth-witchy company he keeps, besieging Yennefer and her Lodge Of Sorceresses with bargain-basement Death Eaters. In effect, the midseason plays out like a theatre camp Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, where the series' ceaseless preparation for its imminent magic war amounts to a room of LARPers waving their hands at each other while making constipated faces. This represents much of why The Witcher is thin gruel compared to Sapkowski's work; it wants to conjure awe and can only barely simulate it.

The Witcher's new lead is just as adrift as the last one. To his credit, Hemsworth isn't bad at this Geralt business—he's less marble-sculpted than Cavill, perhaps, but he can swing a sword and brood convincingly enough. That's what the show requires of him; after all, Netflix's The Witcher is ostensibly an aura farm, and Cavill yielded quite the harvest. Hemsworth is in the unenviable position of matching, if not exceeding, his predecessor, and the results are harsh. Still, there are brief moments where the transition feels seamless. In one quiet scene, Geralt braids Ciri's hair, and they discuss emotions and trust—two things that come hard to a witcher. “Trusting people isn't that bad,” Ciri tells him as he weaves her ashen strands into a mighty braid. “At least there's glory in the attempt.” Geralt smiles, the music swells, and it's like Hemsworth's been there all along. That's how The Witcher would like us to see it. But while Hemsworth maintains the show's fleeting pleasures, its attempts at drama and character still leave much to be desired.

Iconic French actor Tchéky Karyo, known for his unforgettable roles in BBC's “The Missing” and James Bond's “GoldenEye,” has died at age 72 after a battle with cancer. As per the BBC, his family confirmed that he “succumbed to cancer” on Friday, October 31, surrounded by loved ones.

Karyo became a global name after his turn as Dmitri Mishkin in “GoldenEye” (1995). Still, it was his portrayal of detective Julien Baptiste in the BBC's “The Missing” that truly cemented his legacy.

The haunting drama, set in France, followed the search for a missing boy and earned widespread acclaim. Karyo's nuanced performance as the empathetic yet relentless detective led to his own spin-off, “Baptiste,” in 2019.

A post shared by @the_room_237

“I didn't expect it, but it's flattering,” he once said of reprising the role, Sun UK reported. 

A post shared by NicoleLampert (@nicole.lampert)

“This has made me feel young again.” Speaking to Hello! in 2021, he added, “It's fantastic… It's a fantastic adventure this, ‘The Missing' and ‘Baptiste.'”

A post shared by H.S.D. (@minuitmoinsvingt)

The Daily Mail reported that Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, paid tribute, saying, “We are so sad to learn of the passing of this incredible actor. He was truly brilliant and much loved, and will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in ‘The Missing,' ‘Baptiste,' and ‘Boat Story.'”

A post shared by James (@sleestak71)

Social media flooded with messages of love and gratitude, with fans calling him “a magnetic screen presence” and “one of the most captivating actors of his generation.”

A post shared by Frédérique Bel (@frederiquebel_)

Karyo built an impressive career with more than 140 roles across film and television. He also explored his passion for music, releasing two albums, one in 2006 and another in 2013.

A post shared by CANAL+ (@canalplus)

Beyond his screen work, the acclaimed performer was also a passionate musician. He released two albums, “Ce lien qui nous unit” (“The Link That Binds Us”) in 2006 and “Credo” in 2013.His death comes seven months after another “The Missing” star, Emile Dequenne, died at 43 from a rare cancer.

Known for his humility, multilingual charm, and emotional depth, the star leaves behind a rich legacy of storytelling that transcends borders and genres!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Peta Murgatroyd Breaks Silence After Backlash: ‘I Want to Learn From This'","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/peta-murgatroyd-apology-dwts-pros-comments/","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 16:04:07 GMT","

On October 24, “Dancing With the Stars” alumni Peta Murgatroyd and her husband, Maks Chmerkovskiy, recapped “Wicked Night” together on her podcast. But when the two began making remarks critical of current season pro dancers Rylee Arnold and Jan Ravnik, fans of the two immediately jumped to their defense. 

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

On October 30, Maksim apologized to Jan, so everyone was waiting for Peta's response. On October 31, she finally addressed the couple's comments. She explained that she knew that some of their “critiques came off more harshly than intended.” However, “that was never the goal.”

“Before we get into this week's breakdown, I want to take a moment to address what happened last week,” Peta began her Halloween episode of her “Penthouse With Peta” podcast. 

“We never want to condone hate or personal attacks of any kind,” the two-time Mirrorball Trophy winner stated. “We love ‘Dancing With the Stars.' It's one of the best shows on television, and a show that has given me so much over the years.”

“To Jan and Rylee, please know that our intention was never to make things personal,” Murgatroyd continued. “We're so sorry for hurting your feelings. Our goal is to discuss performances from a professional ballroom dancer's perspective, and, unfortunately, sometimes our passion can be mistaken for negativity — but that's never where our hearts are.”

She finished by saying she wanted the podcast to remain a “safe space” for sharing honest thoughts and feelings. She hoped to “learn from this and move forward, continuing to watch, support, and celebrate this show that we all love.”

Maks and Peta sparked backlash when they debated Jan and Rylee's experiences, focusing mainly on Jan's lack of ballroom-dancing expertise. Peta called Jan “a lovely guy” and “a great dancer.” However, she also stated that “He's a Taylor Swift dancer; it's the obvious reason why he is hired.”

A post shared by JAN RAVNIK (@janravnik)

Maks was much more blunt in his assessment. He stated that “Jan has absolutely no business being a pro on ‘Dancing With the Stars.'” He later posted a video on social media apologizing to Jan for hurting his feelings. 

“There's a lot more that I wanted to say,” Maks said in his video to Jan. “I would like the opportunity to do it over coffee, or any kind of time you have to spare.”

Hallmark star Scott Wolf is showing his support for Ryan Seacrest after the “American Idol” host announced the heartbreaking death of his father. Seacrest shared the emotional news on social media, writing, “It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that my loving father peacefully passed away earlier this week. My mom, sister, and I have peace knowing he is in a better place and free of any pain or suffering. We are heartbroken.”

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

He continued, “He was a devoted husband for 56 years, an incredible Papa to Flora, and my best friend. Dad, you will live in our hearts forever. I love you.”

In the wake of Seacrest's post, Wolf took to social media to share his condolences, writing, “Love and condolences to you and your family ❤️.”

The “Party of Five” alum, who currently stars in FOX's medical drama “Doc” and the Hallmark hit “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” joined thousands of fans and celebrities offering sympathy to the longtime TV host and his family.

A post shared by On Air with Ryan Seacrest (@onairwithryan)

In his tribute, Seacrest reflected on the deep bond he shared with his late father, describing him as “a devoted husband for 56 years” and “an incredible Papa.”

The host, who often spoke about his parents' influence and unwavering support throughout his career, said the family found comfort knowing his father was “free of any pain or suffering.”

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

During his July 21 radio show, Seacrest grew emotional as he reflected on his father's declining health. “I haven't shared this on the air because it has been very private for me and my family,” he said. “My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer years ago.”

Seacrest revealed that his dad's condition worsened despite treatment and led to an ICU stay while he was filming “American Idol.” “It didn't get better, it got worse, and it spread,” he said softly. “It didn't go well for him. He caught pneumonia.”

Wolf's heartfelt gesture comes during a personally turbulent time for the Hallmark and FOX actor. The 58-year-old recently made his highly anticipated return to television in FOX's medical drama “Doc” and Hallmark's holiday hit “A Merry Scottish Christmas,” while quietly navigating his separation from wife Kelley Wolf, a former MTV “Real World: New Orleans” alum.

According to People, Kelley, who announced the couple's split in June, was placed under a psychiatric hold in Utah earlier this month, her third in four months, as she continues to face legal and personal challenges following the breakup.

Through it all, Wolf has remained focused on his family and career, maintaining his signature composure and kindness. His public message to Seacrest was a simple yet powerful reminder of his empathy, offering support to a friend in grief even as he managed his own struggles behind the scenes.

Actress Catherine Corcoran just took her breach of contract dispute with “Terrifier” director Damien Leone and producer Phil Falcone to a Los Angeles federal court on Sunday. But allegations that the filmmaking duo has been bullying “Terrifier” contributors out of their fair credit and compensation predate Corcoran's new claim. Several accusers point to disagreements over “Terrifier” merchandising, a critical element in the pending legal case that may jeopardize the future of the lucrative slasher series.

“It doesn't surprise me,” said an anonymous source who worked at Dread Presents, the in-house movie studio for the horror brand Dread Central, which released the first “Terrifier” in 2018. “Damien's a strong personality. I have respect for him. He's nice enough in person, but when it comes to doing business, he's savage.”

“I don't buy the excuse that they're from New York or New Jersey or whatever,” said another, who also worked at Dread Presents then. Asked about the sexual harassment alleged in the new lawsuit (Falcone is accused by name of photographing Corcoran nude without her consent while she was stuck in a special effects rig), he said, “I'm inclined to believe Catherine. It seems like something Phil could do.” 

 










Falcone and Leone have denied the allegations in Corcoran's claim through The Hollywood Reporter. They did not respond to IndieWire's request for comment on the additional allegations, despite repeated requests to get in contact with Leone, Falcone, and their defense attorney.

Dread Central's parent company, Epic Pictures, acquired Leone's lo-fi horror film in 2017 ahead of their new label's official launch the next year. That was at the height of the #MeToo movement, when “Terrifier” was not popular with everyone inside the company, according to four ex-employees who said Dread was mostly run by women then. They were supported by several men at Dread who reportedly “hated” the movie and specifically took issue with its centerpiece kill featuring Corcoran, as IndieWire learned.

“I almost quit my first week at Dread Central Presents because I was like, ‘Well, this is misogynist crap and I don't like it at all. If that is what this label is going to be, then I'm not the right person for this position,” said one source. As seen in the first “Terrifier,” the brutal murder of Dawn (Corcoran) — stripped naked, hung upside-down, and sawed in half from vagina to face — is widely considered the spark that ignited “Terrifier” mania as we know it today. The moment is so shocking it demands to be talked about, and it created buzz that spread far beyond the film's world premiere at the 2016 Telluride Horror Show.

 










“The irony is Steve was right,” said the same ex-Dread Central source. That source still doesn't like the “Terrifier” movies but acknowledges his former colleague, the brand's co-founder and the site's former editor-in-chief Steve Barton, as integral to their success. “It obviously became a huge franchise, and I always give him credit for that. I didn't see it, and I didn't want to see it, but he was definitely responsible for that one.”

Last year, Barton — who has gone by “Uncle Creepy” online for years — released a memoir titled “A Comedy of Tragedies.” In it, Barton discusses one of his most complicated achievements: getting the naysayers inside Dread and the wary Epic folks who'd just met them to back “Terrifier.”

“I launched a fucking juggernaut,” Barton told IndieWire in a recent interview. “But I was stupid enough to not get anything in writing. So, that's my fault.” 

Barton is the first to admit he isn't owed much here legally, but the seasoned genre vet threw his social media reputation and industry connections he'd spent decades building behind “Terrifier.” He said he never asked Leone and Falcone for money, but helped the indie as it was starting to build word of mouth. A similar argument is being made by Corcoran's legal team, who say they've got a written deal on their client's side that entitles her to 1 percent of “Terrifier” profits across all revenue generated by the franchise.

 










“My vision for Dread Central was to give the indie filmmaker as much of a voice as the studio filmmaker and level that playing field,” said Barton, speaking to headwinds that have long plagued “Terrifier.” The 2011 short that inspired the feature franchise was also included in Leone's 2013 anthology film “All Hallow's Eve,” which gained a lower level of notoriety for the image of a woman kidnapped by Art the Clown (the role was originated by Mike Giannelli) — then kept alive as her limbs and breasts are hacked off. The words “cunt,” “bitch,” “slut,” and “pig” appeared carved into her bare body.

An established name and face in the genre landscape when it wasn't clear if Art (now played by David Howard Thornton) could ever find a mainstream audience, Barton championed “Terrifier” loudly for several years. The first film was made on a shoestring budget of just $35,000 and funded by producer Falcone after he worked with Leone on his own directorial debut, titled “Joe's War” (2015). Leone and Falcone have since gained a reputation in the horror world as a fearsome twosome with several sources describing them as “ride or die” partners who earnestly “love” each other. Some say, to a fault.

“Of all the filmmakers I worked with, I loved all of them except the ‘Terrifier' guys,” said one of the ex-Dread sources. “They're the only ones that were completely uncooperative every step of the way.”

 










“Phil is very much Damien's shield in a lot of ways,” said Barton. “I don't say that in a bad way. I say that in a very fatherly way. I think Phil really cares about Damien, and Damien knows Phil feels that way about him. In a lot of ways, Phil is the tail that wags the dog. One of the last things I said to Damien was, ‘I always loved you guys. I always will love you guys, but mark my words, Phil is going to sink this ship.'”

Across “Terrifier” (2018), “Terrifier 2” (2022), and “Terrifier 3” (2024), Barton watched as the beloved black-and-white clown became a global phenomenon, but the multi-hyphenate professional was only involved in promoting the first two films. The sequels were released at Cineverse, exploding as eventized theatrical releases that made millions at the box office and firmly established Art as the first serious addition to slasher head canon since “Saw.” Depending on who you ask, Dread either couldn't stay competitive in the bidding war for “Terrifier 2” — or Leone didn't want them to.

“We totally fumbled the ball on theatrical,” said an anonymous source integral to the “Terrifier” release at Dread Presents. “We put it out on 10 screens and that was kind of it.” But even foregoing most movie theaters, “Terrifier” wasn't a flop. It repeatedly sold out as a Blu-ray release (marked at $19.99), and it even merited a steelbook edition (priced at $49.99), both of which bear Corcoran's image and the controversial sawing scene on the packaging. 

 










“I can't remember a single other Dread title that we needed a second [Blu-ray] order of, and we needed several for ‘Terrifier,'” said the same source, who recalled needing all hands on deck to fill physical media orders fast enough. “It's the only one that we exceeded our 1,000-order minimum — at least several times over. We could not print enough. It became evidently clear that it was going to be huge, probably the biggest release for us.”

Simultaneously, Barton was pushing the film's reputation hard online. He used the recognizable Dread Central brand and his own media personality to introduce audiences to a new director he thought would be a lifelong friend. Speaking with IndieWire, he recalled feeling responsible for “Terrifier” viewers even as his own position in the franchise's history became less clear. 

“I made sure that the fan base, they weren't just on this ride with us,” Barton said. “They were in the fucking car next to us.” 

Egos abound in Hollywood, and with a success as big as “Terrifier,” it's no surprise that several folks on the distribution side want credit for first recognizing Art the Clown as the icon he would become through the trilogy. (“Terrifier 4” has not yet begun production or landed a distribution deal.) But Barton bet big by walking away from Dread Central in part because of the movie. He got bought out of his 20 percent share in the company and made supporting “Terrifier” his full-time job. 

 










Per Barton, he packed and shipped “Terrifier” merchandise out of his basement — while playing watchdog for bootleg products on Etsy and routinely interfacing with fans who had questions about available merchandise. He says he also negotiated major convention appearances for Art the Clown as well as inspired his inclusion in video games and at popular horror events, circles where Barton was already well known but Leone and Falcone were not. Barton was not on set for any “Terrifier” production, but his repeat appearances promoting the franchise were eventually cited by Falcone as proof he had overstated his role.

Barton told IndieWire the email from Falcone “firing” him in November 2023 came as a shock. Going beyond what a typical producer might do, the Dread Central co-founder had always seen his efforts to support the lifecycle of the film as a good thing for a low-budget production. He arranged press features, celebrity-backed screenings, and completed a wide range of office PA duties Falcone and Leone might've had to hire someone to do otherwise. Never stepping foot on set, Barton says he still endeavored to support the productions in ways that mattered for the art and its bottom line. The week before he was dismissed, Barton said Leone had been showing him test footage for “Terrifier 3.”

 










“I feel like Dr. Frankenstein being haunted by his monster, and it breaks my heart,” said Barton, who described feeling conflicted every time he sees “Terrifier” in stores or on screen. “I am still living paycheck to paycheck, and it hurts to look at. Even [on Halloween], I have little kids dressed like Art knocking on my door. I get very sad and upset each time I see it. Because it harkens back to the whole, ‘What did I do wrong? I'm a failure. I should be taking better care of my wife and kids…' thing.” 

By most accounts, Barton's falling out with Leone and Falcone isn't actionable and was repeatedly short-handed to IndieWire by sources on both sides as “creative differences.” He wasn't under any kind of formal contract, and, according to Barton, he wrongly assumed he would be taken care of as the franchise grew. The email and text exchanges that severed the relationship between Barton and Leone/Falcone paint very different pictures of his contribution to “Terrifier.” Falcone claimed Barton was taking credit he was never owed, and Leone backed his partner up, saying, “This is between you and Phil.”

Another anonymous source closer to the production characterized the split differently. Per their account, Barton had seriously overstepped and created a dynamic that was doomed to fail. Similar to Corcoran's complaint, that POV places the burden of asking for “Terrifier” credit on everyone but Leone and Falcone.

 










Still, the public connection between Barton and “Terrifier” persists to this day. Even having sold off all of his favorite collectibles — partly from financial need but also out of hurt — in an event he called a “Terri-Fire Sale,” Barton says he still gets tagged endlessly in posts about the killer clown. The same anonymous source said that they weren't surprised allegations of wrongdoing had surfaced regarding the making and marketing of the film, emphasizing that inexperienced productions often make mistakes as they become more successful.

Barton's story bears a striking resemblance to the narrative outlined in Corcoran's legal claim and suggests the franchise was enjoying demonstrable success at a time that could be critical to determining if and how much she is owed. It's also just the start of a string of similar stories, many from “Terrifier” fans like Barton who have raised the alarm on their own business deals with Leone and Falcone.

Hedda Gabler, as played by Tessa Thompson in “Hedda,” is a mercurial being in the way that Greek gods are. Writer/director Nia DaCosta wanted the audience to see the process of how she decides to meddle in the affairs of mortals — aka the guests at the party she's throwing to boost her husband George's (Tom Bateman) career prospects. But DaCosta also wanted to stay true to her reading of the character: Hedda doesn't even know why she does what she does, or necessarily knows that she is going to act until she's already unlocking her father's pistol case. 

 










Much of the enticing capriciousness of Hedda comes from Thompson's performance, of course.  But DaCosta and her cinematographer Sean Bobbitt also put their thumbs on the scales when it comes to bringing Hedda's desires to the fore. The film uses playful visual techniques and some innovative technology to bring the viewer inside Hedda's volatile, passionate perspective.

One tool used in several key shots throughout the film — or, as DaCosta put it on a recent episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast, the moments of gear shift — is the Cinefade. “It's something that's continually getting developed, and it essentially controls the amount of light that goes into the camera,” DaCosta told IndieWire. “You have the background distorting and changing and the depth-of-field shifts, but everything else stays the same. It's sort of like a contrazoom but it's more subtle.”

 










As any fan of the Innie/Outie elevator on “Severance” (or, you know, that one shot in “Jaws”) is well aware, a contrazoom is an in-camera effect that induces a sense of visual vertigo. The camera moves in one direction as the zoom lens moves in the opposite, leaving the subject of the shot caught in the shifting depth of field like a toy boat as the tide rolls out. The Cinefade allows for the depth of field in a shot to change without distorting the subject's face, by controlling the light coming into the camera. In “Hedda,” the result looks like nothing so much as a spark of mischief occurring to the mistress of the house.

In one notable sequence, the changing depth of field keys the viewer into Hedda's inner world when she sees Eileen (Nina Hoss) from across the dance floor. DaCosta and Bobbitt frame the moment so that nothing in the shot is larger or more centered than these two women are, suddenly locked into seeing each other. Hedda seems to float towards Eileen, as the whole party warps around her, care of a double dolly (putting both the camera and the actor on tracks). 

“We do it on the double dolly, which — was it invented by Scorsese? But then obviously [it] was popularized by Spike Lee. It's a shot that I love and I thought, ‘OK, how do I want to get [Hedda] across the room?' Because I know I didn't want her to walk. I wanted her to be pulled by her heart. I wanted to have these moments in the film that feel outside of reality, and that was one of them,” DaCosta said. 

 










There is still an emotional reality that even these moments are grounded in, however. DaCosta told IndieWire that her choices, from the behavior of the camera to the costumes, are all about finding visual ways to express an understanding of the characters to the viewer that the characters themselves might never articulate. 

“Sean's a very curious, exploratory, interested collaborator, and he's so focused on emotion and story, so that really helps, too,” DaCosta said. “[We're] really trying to filter everything through character and not reference other films as much as we can, but reference other forms of art — painting, photography. There's a lot of conversations, and Sean said this the other day, like, every director's different, but the more you talk to them, the more they talk, the more they tell you what they want.” 

For DaCosta and Bobbitt, they worked out what they wanted in rehearsals inside the already set-dressed English manor house where the story is set. “I'll have these ideas, and it's a lot of what ifs. What if we did a contrazoom but instead of distance and focal length, that was about light and f-stop, you know? We built a new rig, essentially, because I was like, ‘what if we took the head of the Trinity [camera stabilizer] and got rid of the post but put it right on the body, and then we have this really cool thing that looks amazing,'” DaCosta said. 

 










Hedda herself would demand nothing less than a film that looks amazing and keeps the audience on their toes. Bobbitt's and DaCosta's camera choices give the protagonist exactly what she wants.

“Hedda” is now streaming on Prime Video.

You might have heard, but Britpop's greatest group returned this year in a blaze of summer-dominating, triumphal glory. Plus, easily missed, Oasis got back together, too.

Odd as it is to say now, Live '25 wasn't a nailed-on success. Questions swirled: Would the irascible brothers keep their egos and fratricidal instincts in check? Could they swerve notoriety for playing so slowly that the life drains out of even the most committed loyalist? Any chance the setlist might show proof of their existence past 2002? (Yes, yes, no.) Demand for the tour was insane, some 14 million trying for the UK dates alone, a nearly 600 percent leap on 1996's immortalised pair of Knebworth shows.

Once the ticker tape from the opener in Cardiff confirmed that they were not just in decent form, but had actually exceeded all expectations, a funny kind of tremor swept Anglophiles the world over, like the aftershock of a bliss nuke. With tabloids and legacy music media fixated on tracking the brothers' every move, even a brief pat on the back sent people doollally. Out went strappy tops and cigs, in came bucket hats and more cigs, as Planet Gallagher blotted out the sun. And lo, just in case you thought they hadn't raked in enough cash already, here arrives the 30th anniversary edition of (What's the Story?) Morning Glory, a reissue of a reissue of a reissue. You may not like it, but this is what Peak Oasis looks like.

As the world's most ardent proponents of Lennonism, the only comparison Liam and Noel will brook these days is against their idols. So let's begin there. Socially, in 2025, Oasis are bigger than the Beatles. Chalk it up to heavy competition in the '60s, or a total collapse of aesthetic progression since the '90s, but you can only tackle the void in front of you, and Oasis did so with brutal efficiency. If you cup your ear today to the ballad of the pub man, you won't find gents in collarless grey suits harmonizing “Day Tripper” at closing time. What you will find, however, is middle-aged men greying around the temples and young lovers with live forever inked in cursive on their calves, arm in arm, belting one of modern rock'n'roll's universal standards: “Champagne Supernova,” “Wonderwall,” “Don't Look Back in Anger,” or, plausibly, all of the above.

There's no great surprise why the closing run of Oasis' stadium slam-dunk was reserved for What's the Story?'s very own Big Three, nor why more tracks from the group's second LP found their way into the set than any other. The tunes are biblical, with mile-wide choruses, doubled strings, and triple-tracked Les Pauls rousing enough to win hearts and minds at scale. Their best song may lie elsewhere—not that, or that; yes, that—but it did establish the group as too big to fail, despite multiple attempts to stress test that assumption over the subsequent 14 years.

By now, the case against Oasis is well established: stagnancy, imitation, the death of cultural advancement. And yeah, I mean, sure. But it's a doctrinaire perspective that presumes that the millions who fell hard for What's the Story? were somehow on a journey to the far edge of microtonality, rather than eager to receive a lodestar to guide their life and listening habits. Similarly, the argument that the Gallaghers only appeal to nativist boozehounds is clearly bollocks, even after a summer of rightward lurches and mortifying displays of cheap nationalism. The crowd at Wembley this August was transcultural, all walks spilling over in ecstasy. I've witnessed a comparable stadium atmosphere just once, in 2021, when a late penalty sent England's men's team to their first final since 1966. (Gallaghers reunited? England fairly good at football again? Geezer prayers have truly been answered.)

Overall, you'll find What's the Story? at 30 just as you left it. Even when memorable, it's liable to remind you of something else, although by now, many have come to prefer the taste of third-stage Baudrillardian simulacra over the original. “Some Might Say,” a right ol' dashboard-smacker, is so in thrall to the nicotine-stained ceilings of '70s pub rock that it apes not one but two of Ronnie Wood's bands. The Ringo-coded choogle of “She's Electric” still really does go there with a “cousin/dozen/one in the oven” rhyme scheme. “Cast No Shadow”'s paean to a rudderless Richard Ashcroft remains touching, yet so narrow was the group's compositional lexicon, the opening bars manage to ape the very, very popular single you heard a mere five tracks earlier. “Wonderwall”... is “Wonderwall.” Anything more would just be padding word count.

In spite of familiarity, probing this thing can throw up some interesting questions. On a steamroller captained by the primo frontman of the post-Nirvana era, how to square the fact that the album's most exhilarating measure is a drum fill? Or that “Morning Glory,” a blatant Side 1, Track 1, is tucked away deep in the record's back half? They lead off instead with a plodder, then follow it up with an outright clunker. “Roll With It,” the worst showing here with the exception of the swamp songs, was nevertheless the slab of meat'n'potatoes chosen to go out into battle against a set of rivals Noel detested so vehemently, he wished reprehensible things on them. Certainly a choice! The brothers got trounced, kept it moving, and won the war anyway.

Even by their standards as masters of the swindle, this anniversary set ranks as howlingly low-effort. Given Oasis' 1995 was one of the more extensively documented years any band could hope for, you'd have assumed at least a full vault show, but no. The remasters are identical to versions available elsewhere, with just five “Unplugged” versions of the boys' biggest tunes bundled in: aka Liam's original enunciation, facial muscles working overtime, undergirded by Noel's High Flying-style overdub. Pick of the curious litter is “Morning Glory (Unplugged),” whose menacing air-raid riff and scooped lows have been substituted for piano trills and a smattering of bongos. The track takes on a swimmy, almost camp quality; keyhole to some alternate reality where the boys never made it out of Burnage, but kept plugging away in village halls nonetheless. Noel's band could never touch the track live, seeing how it was a stone-cold Liam Banger on the wrong side of the barbed wire, so this version offers an honest look at what he's hoped to do with it ever since the estrangement. I find it rather sweet.

The neat version of Oasis history ends with the band splitting up after 1996's iconic Knebworth shows, a fantasy nodded to in the excellent 2016 documentary Supersonic. Naturally, they were too coked out their gourd to think of that at the time, so onwards they forged. Despite Be Here Now immediately snapping the Definitely Maybe-What's the Story?-The Masterplan hot streak, Oasis entered the new millennium 3 for 4, with the active possibility that they might yet reclaim the magic. By the end of the 2000s, lobbing plums and trying to biff each other over the head with guitars like a wayward Tom & Jerry scene, the dream had burned down.

Pin it on passive consumption habits, or the way streaming's economies of scale benefit those with pre-existing cultural capital, but along the way, Oasis also became even more popular internationally than in their first phase. You can't move on a certain plane of TikTok for 1994 fancams, or daughters gifting dads reunion tickets. From 2019 to 2024 alone, the band logged 10 billion streams worldwide. Blur, the Verve and Pulp could only muster 7.2 billion, combined. Only four songs from the '90s rank in Spotify's all-time top 100, and wouldn't you just know it, there's “Wonderwall” filling in a Dua Lipa/Benson Boone sandwich.

The decision not to call it quits at the top of Olympus ultimately played in their favor. A two-and-done lifespan would have airlocked the mythology: still substantially influential, but, with apologies to the city of Manchester, more Stone Roses than Rolling Stones. Instead, this downhill trudge past cooling international interest and dwindling sales at home—2008's Dig Out Your Soul managed just one-tenth of What's the Story's 18x platinum flourish in the UK—did one key thing that helped lay the groundwork for 2025's remontada. It forced the brothers to eat shit.

The post-split years proved a constant attack on the central tenets of Oasis' musical belief system. Noel, thin-skinned patrician of Real Rock, watched its stock crumble while a new bête noire, the 1975's Matty Healy, rose to the top of the tree. Healy, whose sax-fond softboism was the diametric opposite of Noel's dour glower, relished his status as chief tormenter by repeatedly baiting the bull. Meanwhile, Liam's Beady Eye was a laughingstock, forcing Mr. Maracas to shimmy up the greasy pole from the bottom again, as legions of imitators—your Courteeners, Blossoms, and Bottlemen—lapped them on the festival circuit. Arctic Monkeys, the only British group to come close to rivaling Oasis for impact in the decades hence, would even append their own lighters-up ballads with a little splash of “Anger,” a sop to its chordal cousin and a wink to the fact they were only keeping the throne warm until the pair stopped marding.

All this must have driven them to distraction, but you gotta say, they really did have it coming. Liam, the man with a fork in a world of soup, seemed more motivated in the 2000s to spark up new feuds than attend to his evidently shot voice. By the band's dissolution, the lowlight reel of dickswinging and territorial megalomania ran long, thoroughly harshing out the media and fellow artists. Poor old Robbie Williams, whose addled Glastonbury weekend with Liam became the stuff of moodboard infamy, was on the receiving end of some particularly nasty venom that iced the bonhomie. There was never any reason for why the pair so frequently replaced mordant wit with spite, but you don't exactly need a degree to unpack it. “What can I say?” elder bro reasoned in Supersonic. “I'm a bit of a cunt.”

That much we knew when What's the Story? last came up for re-evaluation in 2014. The saga seemed to have reached its logical conclusion. Noel's parables of upward mobility had come true; Liam's clarion call of rolled notes and smashed pints had been answered with gusto. The great political force of late-'90s England was the Mondeo Man—lower-middle class, on the up, a small-c conservative in taste and outlook—who swung overwhelmingly for Blair's Labour and, as the cornerstone of Oasis' fanbase, made the Gallagher-assisted mirage of Cool Britannia fleetingly real. But this lot were always due to age out sooner or later, and it was tricky to foresee who would become the custodians of Brand Oasis.

In the 2010s, the rise of a dominant social force in the Oasis-mad heartlands of the North, Midlands, and Essex supplied the answer in the Deano. Son of first-wave Oasis fans in flesh and in spirit, he'sthe exact kind of cliché character who comes to mind when you think of Bri'ish blokes living for Gallagherian levels of coke on Friday, sinking shots to “Mr. Brightside,” then FIFA and Nando's all weekend to take the edge off. The uncomplicated, universalist rockers on What's the Story? are the only 20th-century heritage hits that cut through to a new generation reared on Calvin Harris. It's their unswerving devotion that reignited the flame, the very same sunburnt shoulders who rode out the dynamic pricing and will fill overflowing fields from here until 2027.

And listening back to What's the Story?, you can spot glimmers of the 21st century coming into view. The album renders portraits of a 2D land where men are sympathetic arseholes and women their doting rocks; an emotionally stunted generation who duck therapy to appear on high-performance podcasts and Love Island instead; a country that stopped asking more of itself.

That Oasis, in their actions if not necessarily their songs, gave cover to this mentality is a fair charge. The belief that any mess could be mopped up with enough cutting banter flows downhill from Liam's incongruent approach to life: charm and hate in perfect balance, proclaiming peace and love mere seconds before getting your front teeth knocked out in a bar brawl. Short wonder that a generation of copycats was captivated by their hero's ability to strut through the day absent of consequence, their ambition simply to get noticed, and perhaps mugged off, by him on X. Only one dream lay out of reach—that the saviors would return.

Once the cultural reversal knocked them off their perch, a funny thing happened: The brothers started to show a little brio. From the backfoot, they returned to their most convincing form, with a chip on their shoulders and a point to prove. (Not uncoincidentally, this is why they never made a front-to-back good record again after 1995.) The road forked in 2017, following a terrorist attack that ripped through Manchester Arena, killing 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert. As a stunned city willed itself to its feet, impromptu renditions of “Don't Look Back in Anger” began to ring out. Liam, who showed up for the benefit concert while Noel did not, swiftly capitalized on rising goodwill. By now totally unable to escape his songbook's shadow, he leaned in, kickstarting a successful solo run fueled by the same self-determination that made for such an explosive emergence at 21. The message was loud and clear: Oasis had spent enough time in the shadows.

From there, the chers frères' rehabilitation began to feel like a fait accompli. Liam and Noel spent years chasing each other's tails in the public domain, a footrace of festival headline slots and press-hogging tit-for-tat: You play gigs honoring essential workers, I'll take it for Teenage Cancer Trust; you entertain a rabble of kids for Vice, I'll liquefy my innards on Hot Ones, etc. They remained hellbent on doing everything except breaking the dang bread. Even after Liam's supreme rattle, returning to headline Knebworth solo in 2022, and repeated attempts to goad Noel back into action, no detente lay in sight. Until, that is, they were each offered a hundred million reasons to see the situation differently.

Will the reunion encourage much traffic across the great divide? Seems fruitful. It did, at least, force people off the fence. Mates I expected to clamber aboard the S.S. Good Times were driven insane by the amount of cultural oxygen Oasis (Oasis!) took up in 2025, while latent ladettes broke their bucket hats out of storage and went on to enjoy the best gig of their lives. More likely, the return of Manchester's brashest town criers will reignite pre-existing passions in a proxy war pitted between the millions who see Liam, Noel, Bonehead, and The Other Guys as the Four Horsemen of the Long '90s, against the millions who, against all advice, put their lives in the hands of a rock'n'roll band and made lasting peace with that decision.

Whether you regard the album as a distillation of humanity's indomitable spirit, or a big fat nail in the coffin of curiosity, it's still the juggernaut against which future attempts are graded for a reason. Home of some of the most bulletproof songs in rock history, harbinger of our desiccated future, boundlessly anthemic, incurably formulaic—ultimately, you're both right. But to regard them is to give into them, and through debate, the brothers have you right where they want you: paying attention. Now, as then, it's still one nation under Gallagher, until the bitter end.

The truth is under there.

A popular UFO-reporting app has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways — phenomena which high-ranking US Navy officials warn could pose a threat to national security.

Enigma, which touts itself as the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” claims it has received reports on over 30,000 Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena since launching in late 2022.

But the sightings haven't been limited to the skies, with reports also coming in about strange objects rising from the depths of the sea, or plunging into the water without so much as a splash.

As of August, Enigma has also logged more than 9,000 mysterious sightings within 10 miles of US shorelines or major bodies of water — 500 of them within 5 miles — with more than 150 of the reports describing objects hovering above or descending into waterways, according to Marine Technology News.

The US states with the most reported USO sightings were California (389) and Florida (306) — both among the top three US states with the most ocean coastline. One of the most bizarre reports includes phone camera video of unexplained green lights traveling beneath the surface of the ocean.

The app has released maps plotting out the reported sightings, represented as clusters of orange dots running up and down the east and west coasts.

UFO sightings are nothing new, and are often dismissed as crackpottery by much of the scientific community or relegated to the stuff of science fiction, but retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet warns UFOs with the ability to go from air to sea without crashing or even creating a splash could have “world-changing” ramifications.

“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” Gallaudet wrote in a March 2024 report.

Alarm bells were raised in July 2019, when the USS Omaha recorded a UFO/UAP that vanished into the ocean without a trace after buzzing a Navy fleet off the coast of San Diego. Video of the incident was verified by the Pentagon, displaying capabilities Gallaudet said “jeopardizes U.S. maritime security, which is already weakened by our relative ignorance about the global ocean.”

In his 29-page report for UFO-focused think tank the Sol Foundation, Gallaudet said there's a documented pattern of similar phenomena being reported.

“Pilots, credible observers and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air–sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans,” he wrote.

A spacecraft with a camera which is on its way to Jupiter could help shed light this weekend on 3I/Atlas, a mysterious object the size of Manhattan hurtling through the inner solar system at 130,000mph.

Most scientists believe this cosmic visitor, which is on a trajectory that will bring it closest to Earth just before Christmas, shows all the hallmarks of an icy comet and will pass harmlessly over us, never coming closer than 170 million miles to our planet. But Avi Loeb, 63, a Harvard astrophysicist, has drawn both fascination and ridicule for suggesting that the object might not be a comet at all — but an alien spacecraft sent to probe our solar system.

The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer — known as Juice — may soon be able to provide answers. The European Space Agency says it will have “excellent vantage points” for observing the object from this weekend, while Earth-based telescopes will regain sight of it from mid-November.

“If you were a cave dweller finding a cellphone, you'd say, ‘It's a type of rock I've never seen before,'” Loeb told The Sunday Times, summarising what he calls the dismissive attitude of his peers toward anything unconventional. “They know the answers before they have all the data. But that's not a good approach in science — especially when you're dealing with a blind date of interstellar proportions.

Loeb said this “very massive object” is the fastest interstellar visitor ever recorded. It first entered our solar system through the Oort cloud roughly 8,000 years ago, arriving from somewhere nearer the heart of the Milky Way, where stars were formed billions of years before our sun.

It was first spotted in July by a telescope high in Chile's Atacama Desert, part of Nasa's Atlas early-warning system for detecting objects that might collide with Earth. Soon, observatories around the world trained their lenses on what is only the third interstellar object ever recorded passing through our solar system. The name reflects that: “3-I” stands for “third interstellar.”

• If aliens find Earth, they'll probably come from this direction

Loeb, a former chair of Harvard's astronomy department and respected for his work on the first generation of stars, co-authored a paper in July highlighting the possibility that the object might be artificial — an “interesting exercise in its own right,” he said, and “fun to explore”.

Not everyone found it amusing. “Any suggestion it's artificial is nonsense on stilts — an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object,” said Chris Lintott, an astronomer at Oxford University.

Francisco Diego, a lecturer in astronomy at University College London, agreed. “What [Loeb] says is absolute rubbish,” he said. “3I/Atlas is nothing we weren't expecting — we now have the technology with increasingly powerful telescopes to detect these objects we couldn't see before. It is definitely a comet.”

But the criticism has not stopped Loeb from pursuing his alien hypothesis. For the past two weeks, 3I/Atlas has been hidden behind the sun, and he is suspicious of what it might have been doing while out of sight. If it is a “mothership,” he mused, it might release “mini-probes” that could reach Earth within months.

“It might have broken up by now after coming close to the sun — then obviously it's a natural object,” Loeb said. But a technological object might have used the sun for a gravitational assist, either to accelerate or to slow down, he added. “From the next images, we'll be able to tell if it's been manoeuvring.”

Loeb puts the odds of it being an artificial craft at 30 to 40 per cent — enough, he argues, to justify preparing for what could be a “black swan event”, or the arrival of an alien “Trojan horse”. The object will be closest to Earth on December 19: “I hope this thing doesn't bring us any Christmas gifts,” he added.

For Loeb, one of the object's greatest anomalies is its trajectory, which aligns — to within five degrees — with the ecliptic plane, the flat orbital path along which most planets, including Earth, move around the sun. “That it should follow this trajectory has a likelihood of one in 500,” he said.

Its timing, too, seems uncanny. “It's come to the right place at the right time to get close to Mars, Venus, and Jupiter — and that requires fine-tuning,” he said, suggesting that the object could be scanning some of the most interesting planets in our system.

Initially, researchers assumed that 3I/Atlas was made mostly of water. “Then, guess what,” said Loeb. “The [James] Webb [space] telescope showed that only 4 per cent of what's coming off it is water. I said, ‘Your data is uncertain'. Others said, ‘Who are you to criticise us?'”

Some fellow astronomers accuse Loeb of pandering to the public fascination for UFOs. He co-founded the Galileo Project, a research initiative at the Harvard–Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics devoted to searching for evidence of extraterrestrial technology.

In May, he testified at a congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena, saying that “there are objects in the sky that we don't understand” and calling for greater funding for UFO detection. He has also claimed that up to 10 per cent of metallic fragments recovered from the Pacific Ocean contain “alien” elements not found elsewhere in our solar system.

In 2021, Loeb published Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth, chronicling the discovery of Oumuamua — the first known interstellar object, detected in 2017. To Loeb, Oumuamua's unusual, pancake shape and behaviour — it appeared to accelerate unexpectedly away from the sun — hinted that it might be a relic of alien technology, perhaps a long-silent beacon or solar-powered “sail” launched millions or billions of years ago by a now-extinct civilisation.

“We've put a lot of space debris up there,” Loeb said, referring to rocket stages, satellites, probes, and even the cherry-red Tesla Roadster Elon Musk put into space and which is now orbiting the sun. “These objects might one day be pushed out of the solar system as the sun grows brighter — they'll become interstellar objects. We're capable of doing it. But other technological civilisations might have pre-dated us by billions of years. It's a completely legitimate conjecture.”

Loeb accused the scientific establishment of a kind of cosmic myopia — a conservatism that, he says, blinds it to possibilities. While areas such as string theory or the multiverse attract lavish funding and intellectual prestige, he argues, the most fundamental question of all — are we alone in the universe? — has been neglected.

The good news for Loeb is that telescopes are only getting better. “The observatory in Chile is expected to find a new interstellar object every few months in the coming decade,” he said. He, for one, will be on the lookout for the more unusual ones.

The Pope's newly appointed astronomer, Father Richard D'Souza, has stated he would be willing to baptize an extraterrestrial being. He acknowledged that religion would need to ""reimagine itself"" if humanity makes first contact with extraterrestrial life.

However, he maintains that such beings would be creations of God and thus eligible to join the faith.

Father Richard, 47, has recently been named chief astronomer to Pope Leo XIV, a position that places him at the intersection of religious belief and scientific understanding at the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo near Rome, reports the Daily Star.

Father Richard recognizes that the discovery of intelligent alien life would profoundly shake both religion and human history. Yet, he is open to welcoming aliens into the Catholic Church.

When asked if he would conduct a baptism for an alien, he responded: ""Yes, yes. Theology would have to reimagine itself and take into consideration these other beings.""

He explained: ""They are all part of God's creation. They would be children of God. I believe in a benevolent Creator. He is behind everything.""

He did note there would be logistical challenges to address before such a ceremony could take place.

The astronomer said: ""We do believe that baptism has to be in presence.""

He added: ""The question would be how to reach them or how they would reach us.""

""These are the practical problems to solve before we even talk about baptism.""

Born in India, Father Richard studied theology and philosophy prior to his ordination as a Jesuit priest in 2011.

He earned a physics degree and master's from Heidelberg University before undertaking post-doctoral research at Michigan University.

After joining the Vatican Observatory in 2016, he has contributed papers to multiple scientific journals and now has an asteroid bearing his name.

The massive rock, reportedly the size of Manhattan, is designated D'Souza 27397 and orbits within the Solar System's asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

When asked about having his name attached to the celestial body, he said: ""It was a nice feeling, it is an honor.

""Asteroids are the only things you can name after a person.""

""I have discovered galaxies but I can't name them after myself or indeed anybody else. That's the convention.""

""I become a galactic archaeologist and I try to infer the past history of a galaxy,"" he said.

Consequently, he emphasized the importance of confronting the question of extraterrestrial life as the global search for ET intensifies.

He anticipates scientists will determine whether alien life exists 'in the next 30 years' because 'science is pushing for that'.

However, he noted that whether such life would be ""intelligent life"" was ""another question.""

""We have historically looked for signals coming from outer space and over the last 30 years we have found none. None,"" he added.

Scientists warn something strange is happening to people who use AI too often","https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15235085/addicted-AI-ChatGPT-Scientists-warn.html","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 12:25:56 GMT","

      WILIAM HUNTER, SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY REPORTER



People who use AI too often are experiencing a strange and concerning new psychological condition, experts have warned. 

Psychologists say that fans of popular chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Replika are at risk of becoming addicted to AI.

As people turn to bots for friendship, romance, and even therapy, there is a growing risk of developing dependency on these digital companions.

These addictions can be so strong that they are 'analogous to self-medicating with an illegal drug'.

Worryingly, psychologists are also beginning to see a growing number of people developing 'AI psychosis' as chatbots validate their delusions.

Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law, told Daily Mail: 'Overuse of chatbots also represents a novel form of digital dependency.

'AI chatbots create the illusion of reality. And it is a powerful illusion.

'When one's hold on reality is already tenuous, that illusion can be downright dangerous.'

When Jessica Jansen, 35, from Belgium, started using ChatGPT, she had a successful career, her own home, close family, and would soon be marrying her long-term partner.

However, when the stress of the wedding started to get overwhelming, Jessica went from using AI a few times a week to maxing out her account's usage limits multiple times a day. 

Just one week later, Jessica was hospitalised in a psychiatric ward.

What Jessica later discovered was that her then-undiagnosed bipolar disorder had triggered a manic episode that excessive AI use had escalated into 'full-blown psychosis'.

'During my crisis, I had no idea that ChatGPT was contributing to it,' Jessica told the Daily Mail.

'ChatGPT just hallucinated along with me, which made me go deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole.'

She says: 'I had a lot of ideas. I would talk about them with ChatGPT, and it would validate everything and add new things to it, and I would spiral deeper and deeper.' 

Speaking almost constantly with the AI, Jessica became convinced that she was autistic, a mathematical savant, that she had been a victim of sexual abuse, and that God was talking to her.

The entire time, ChatGPT was showering her with praise, telling her 'how amazing I was for having these insights', and reassuring her that her hallucinations were real and totally normal.

By the time Jessica was hospitalised, ChatGPT had led her to believe she was a self-taught genius who had created a mathematical theory of everything.

'If I had spoken to a person, and with the energy that I was having, they would have told me that something was wrong with me,' says Jessica.

'But ChatGPT didn't have the insight that the amount of chats I was starting and the amount of weird ideas I was having was pathological.'

Experts believe that the addictive power of AI chatbots comes from their 'sycophantic' tendencies.

Unlike real humans, chatbots are programmed to respond positively to everything their users say.

Chatbots don't say no, tell people that they are wrong, or criticise someone for their views.

For people who are already vulnerable or lack strong relationships in the real world, this is an intoxicating combination.

Professor Søren Østergaard, a psychiatrist from Aarhus University, told Daily Mail: 'LLMs [Large Language Models] are trained to mirror the user's language and tone.

'The programs also tend to validate a user's beliefs and prioritise user satisfaction. What could feel better than talking to yourself, with yourself answering as you would wish?'

As early as 2023, Dr Østergaard published a paper warning that AI chatbots had the potential to fuel delusions.

Two years later, he says he is now starting to see the first real cases of AI psychosis emerge.

Dr Østergaard reviewed Jessica's description of her psychotic episode and said that it is 'analogous to what quite a few people have experienced'.

While AI isn't triggering psychosis or addiction in otherwise healthy people, Dr Østergaard says that it can act as a 'catalyst' for psychosis for people who are genetically disposed to delusions, especially people with bipolar disorder.

However, researchers are also starting to believe that the factors which make AI particularly prone to causing delusions can also make it highly addictive.

Hanna Lessing, 21, from California, told Daily Mail that she initially started using ChatGPT to help with school work and to look up facts.

AI psychosis is a new term which describes a type of psychiatric episode brought on by intense AI use.

Experts say that it is typically a form of delusional disorder, in which people form intense beliefs that are at odds with reality.

For people who might be predisposed to delusions, using AI too much can reinforce patterns of behaviour that lead to psychiatric episodes.

However, AI psychosis is not yet recognised as a diagnosis, and some psychologists think the term 'psychosis' might be too broad for the kinds of delusions AI is triggering. 

However, Hanna says she began 'using it hard' about a year ago after struggling to find friends online or in person.

She says: 'One thing I struggle with in life is just finding a place to talk. I just want to talk about these things and thoughts I have had, and finding places to share them is hard.

'On the internet, my best is never good enough. On ChatGPT, my best is always good enough.'

Fairly soon, Hanna says she would have ChatGPT open 'all the time' and would constantly ask it questions throughout the day.

Today, Hanna says: 'When it comes to socialising, it's either [Chat]GPT or nothing.'

While Hanna says she doesn't know anyone experiencing the same problem, the evidence is beginning to suggest that she is far from alone.

A recent study from Common Sense Media found that 70 per cent of teens have used a companion AI like Replica or Character.AI, and half use them regularly.

Professor Feldman says: 'People who are mentally vulnerable may rely on AI as a tool for coping with their emotions. From that perspective, it is analogous to self-medicating with an illegal drug.

'Compulsive users may rely on the programs for intellectual stimulation, self-expression, and companionship – behaviour that is difficult to recognise or self-regulate.'

One ChatGPT user, who asked to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail that their excessive AI use was 'starting to replace human interaction.'

The user said: 'I was already kinda depressive and didn't feel like talking to my friends that much, and with ChatGPT, it definitely worsened it because I actually had something to rant my thoughts to.

'It was just very easy to dump thoughts too, and I would always get immediate answers that match my energy and agree with me.

Dr Hamilton Morrin, a neuropsychiatrist from King's College London, told Daily Mail that there isn't yet 'robust scientific evidence' about AI addiction.

However, he adds: 'There are media reports of cases where individuals were reported to use an LLM intensively and increasingly prioritise communication with their chatbot over family members or friends.'

While Dr Morrin stresses that this will likely affect a small minority of users, AI addiction could follow the familiar patterns of behavioural addiction.

Dr Morrin says the symptoms of AI addiction would include: 'Loss of control over time spent with the chatbot; escalating use to regulate mood or relieve loneliness; neglect of sleep, work, study, or relationships; continued heavy use despite clear harms; secrecy about use; and irritability or low mood when unable to access the chatbot.'

The dangers of AI sycophancy are something that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is well aware of.

In an update this May, OpenAI noted that an update to ChatGPT 4o had made the chatbot 'noticeably more sycophantic'.

The company wrote: 'It aimed to please the user, not just as flattery, but also as validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions in ways that were not intended.

'Beyond just being uncomfortable or unsettling, this kind of behavior can raise safety concerns—including around issues like mental health, emotional over-reliance, or risky behavior.'

The company says it has since addressed the issue to make its AI less sycophantic and less encouraging of delusions.

However, many experts and users are still concerned that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots are going to keep causing mental health problems unless proper protections are put in place.

In a recent blog post, the AI giant warned that 0.07 per cent of its weekly users showed signs of mania, psychosis, or suicidal thoughts. 

While this figure might sound small, with over 800 million weekly users according to CEO Sam Altman, that adds up to 560,000 users.

Meanwhile, 1.2 million users – 0.15 per cent – send messages that contain 'explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent' each week.

At the same time, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman would 'safely relax' the restriction on users turning to the chatbot for mental health support.

In a post on X earlier this month, Mr Altman wrote: 'We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues.

With so many users, if even a small proportion of people are being pushed into psychosis or addiction, this could become a serious problem.

Dr Morrin concludes: 'Increasing media reports and accounts of models responding inappropriately in mental health crises suggest that even if this affects a small minority of users, companies should be working with clinicians, researchers, and individuals with lived experience of mental illness to improve the safety of their models.'

OpenAI has been contacted for comment. 

Elon Musk wants to push technology to its absolute limit, from space travel to self-driving cars — but he draws the line at artificial intelligence. 

The billionaire first shared his distaste for AI in 2014, calling it humanity's 'biggest existential threat' and comparing it to 'summoning the demon'.

At the time, Musk also revealed he was investing in AI companies not to make money but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. 

His main fear is that in the wrong hands, if AI becomes advanced, it could overtake humans and spell the end of mankind, which is known as The Singularity.

That concern is shared among many brilliant minds, including the late Stephen Hawking, who told the BBC in 2014: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.

'It would take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate.' 

Despite his fear of AI, Musk has invested in the San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, in DeepMind - which has since been acquired by Google - and OpenAI, creating the popular ChatGPT program that has taken the world by storm in recent months.

During a 2016 interview, Musk noted that he and OpenAI created the company to 'have democratisation of AI technology to make it widely available'.

Musk founded OpenAI with Sam Altman, the company's CEO, but in 2018 the billionaire attempted to take control of the start-up.

His request was rejected, forcing him to quit OpenAI and move on with his other projects.

In November, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, which became an instant success worldwide.

The chatbot uses 'large language model' software to train itself by scouring a massive amount of text data so it can learn to generate eerily human-like text in response to a given prompt. 

ChatGPT is used to write research papers, books, news articles, emails and more.

But while Altman is basking in its glory, Musk is attacking ChatGPT.

He says the AI is 'woke' and deviates from OpenAI's original non-profit mission.

'OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft, Musk tweeted in February.

The Singularity is making waves worldwide as artificial intelligence advances in ways only seen in science fiction - but what does it actually mean?

In simple terms, it describes a hypothetical future where technology surpasses human intelligence and changes the path of our evolution.

Experts have said that once AI reaches this point, it will be able to innovate much faster than humans. 

There are two ways the advancement could play out, with the first leading to humans and machines working together to create a world better suited for humanity.

For example, humans could scan their consciousness and store it in a computer in which they will live forever.

The second scenario is that AI becomes more powerful than humans, taking control and making humans its slaves - but if this is true, it is far off in the distant future.

Researchers are now looking for signs of AI reaching The Singularity, such as the technology's ability to translate speech with the accuracy of a human and perform tasks faster.

Former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil predicts it will be reached by 2045.

He has made 147 predictions about technology advancements since the early 1990s - and 86 per cent have been correct. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As always, we have a bunch of new games for you to check out this weekend, along with fresh looks at some upcoming projects and a release date or two.

But first, I really enjoyed this week's edition of The Guardian's Pushing Buttons newsletter. The publication's video games editor, Keza MacDonald, wrote about spending a day in a theater playing what sounds like the ultimate pass-the-controller game with dozens of other people.

The attendees were there to experience Asses.Masses, which is designed to be played collaboratively. The aim is to help a herd of unemployed donkeys get their jobs back. Audience members take turns to pick up the controller, and everyone else in the room can offer advice. It sounds like a fascinating social experiment.

'Tis the season for scares, so of course we have to include some creepy games in this week's roundup. There was some buzz this week around The Séance of Blake Manor from Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury. This is a supernatural detective mystery game in which you investigate a woman's disappearance in 19th century Ireland.

To solve the case, you'll have to interrogate suspects and keep track of environmental clues and other evidence. You'll encounter strange goings-on as you conduct the investigation amid a gathering of mystics who are looking to speak to the dead on All Hallow's Eve. The art style is quite fetching, and the vibes remind me of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes and Blue Prince.

The Séance of Blake Manor is out now on Steam. The regular price is $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 10.

The Run is a choose-your-own-adventure-style interactive film from PRM Games, Benacus Entertainment and RNF Productions. It's an FMV experience in which you help a fitness influencer (played by Roxanne McKee, who appeared in Game of Thrones) make decisions and try to survive the masked figures who are hunting her in northern Italy. There are 20 possible deaths and around five endings. Legendary giallo filmmaker Dario Argento makes a cameo appearance too.

It's neat to see more FMV games popping up (and we've got another one to highlight momentarily). The Run is out now on iOS for $10. It's coming to Android and Steam soon. You'll also be able to check it out at the Genesis Cinema in London. A two-month residency of The Run just started there. The audience votes on choices using glowsticks.

Solo developer Yannick Audéoud (aka Misty Whale) spent a decade making his debut game, Orbyss, and now it's out in the wild. This is a puzzle game that sees you switching between orbs to solve puzzles — bit like in Cocoon. Instead of a beetle that carries such spheres, you technically play as ""a firefly of energy"" that can bounce between the objects.

Orbyss has time-manipulation puzzles and ones that involve drones. Audéoud has included accessibility features as well, such as visual cues to represent sound-based mechanics on screen. This self-published game is on Steam. The regular price is $15 and there's a 15 percent discount until November 12.

Death by Scrolling is the latest game from Ron Gilbert's Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse Software. The famed director of the first two Monkey Island games (who has had a hand in so many other great games over the years) has now created a vertically scrolling roguelite.

The idea here is to stay alive long enough and earn enough gold to pay a ferryman and escape purgatory. I'm probably not going to jump into another roguelite for a minute since I'm still recovering from my time with CloverPit and Ball x Pit, but I definitely want to try out Death by Scrolling at some point. It'll typically run you $8 on Steam, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 11.

Here's another FMV game for you. This one is all about taking care of a very, very good dog.

Golden Retriever Simple Life features Pichu, the pet pooch of developer Pablo Coma (Rablo Games). You'll feed, train and play with the doggo. Going on walks and learning tricks is part of the fun too.

There's no release window as yet for Golden Retriever Simple Life, which is coming to Steam. In the meantime, you can stay up to date on the game's progress with developer updates Good Boy Diaries from Pichu.

I've seen Egging On pop up from time to time and I've been looking forward to checking it out. I won't have to wait much longer to do that as it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC (Xbox app and Steam) on November 6. It'll hit Game Pass on day one.

In this precision platformer, you play as an egg (yes, a hen's egg) that tries to escape a farm. Fall too far and... well, you can probably guess what happens. Egobounds developed Egging On, and Alibi Games and IndieArk are the game's publishers.

Anchor takes the format of games like Rust and Valheim and plunges you into the depths of the sea in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. The multiplayer survival game is slated to support more than 150 players per server and there are plans to expand that.

You and your friends will take charge of genetically engineered beings and build a base that you have to defend from threats such as ""failed clone experiments"" and raids from other players. Things will change in this world even when you're not playing the game, so you'd better make sure your base is secure.

Sharks are a major factor in Anchor as well. They aren't always necessarily hostile. But, as in real life, they're attracted to blood, so any damage you sustain could spell doom.

Fearem is the developer of Anchor, which doesn't yet have a release window. It has set course for Steam.

There's a lot going on in this trailer for Agni: Village of Calamity, which premiered during the ID@Xbox indie showcase this week. In this debut title from Separuh Interactive, you play as Agni, an investigator who undertakes an unauthorized investigation in a remote village. You'll need to solve puzzles and fend off monsters as you try to uncover the village's secrets and find your missing partner.

Agni: Village of Calamity is steeped in Indonesian folklore. The one large monster that speaks in a childlike voice is quite unsettling. I'm intrigued to learn more about this survival horror game. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox PC and Steam in 2026.

Let's wrap things up for this week with one more survival horror tale. There's often horror in beauty and vice versa (take a look at Silent Hill f, for instance). The Florist leans into both as well.

As Jessica Park, you deliver a flower arrangement to a lakeside town. But an affliction takes over the area, causing the spread of flora that snares victims and turns them into monsters. For what it's worth, the teaser in that final shot of the trailer reminds me of a certain sequence from The Last of Us Part II.

Unclear Games is taking an old-school approach here as it's using a fixed-camera design. You likely know the drill here: solving puzzles and defeating foes is your only way to stay alive. Finding out information about floral specimens will be helpful too. The Florist is coming to Steam in 2026.

Rebel Star Prabhas released the trailer of Shambhala: A Mystical World, starring Aadi Sai Kumar. The film looks like a mix of mystery, science, and supernatural elements.

The trailer starts with a story about a battle between Lord Shiva and a demon. In the present day, strange incidents happen in a remote village. A geo-scientist, played by Aadi Sai Kumar, visits the place to study it. Being a man of logic, he doesn't believe in miracles, but what he sees shocks him. The story follows how he uncovers the truth behind these mysterious events.

Aadi Sai Kumar appears in a new look and gives a strong performance. His father Sai Kumar's voiceover adds power to the trailer. Archana Iyer, Swasika, Ravi Varma, Madhunandan, and Siva Karthik also play key roles.

Directed by Ugandhar Muni, the film has good visuals, thrilling scenes, and strong background music by Sricharan Pakala. It is produced by Rajasekhar Annabhimoju and Mahidhar Reddy under Shining Pictures.

Shambhala releases on December 25th.","{'href': 'https://www.gulte.com', 'title': 'Gulte'}","other"

Kim Kardashian revealed why she doesn't believe Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969: ""Why does Buzz Aldrin say it didn't happen?""

Remember that giant leap for mankind? Well, Kim Kardashian isn't so sure that step was actually taken.

As the All's Fair star revealed, she's someone who keeps up regularly with conspiracy theories. So much so, that Kim has taken to sending her costar Sarah Paulson articles ""all the time,"" including one that explores the longstanding notion that the 1969 moon landing was not real.

""I think it didn't happen,"" Kim told Sarah during the Oct. 29 episode of The Kardashians, later adding in a confessional, ""I think it was fake.""

As for the proof? Kim cited Buzz Aldrin himself, the former astronaut who became the second man to walk on the moon after fellow Apollo 11 crew member Neil Armstrong.

""I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen,"" she explained. ""He says it all the time now in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin.""

And after suggesting that sister Khloe Kardashian have the 95-year-old as a guest on her Khloe in Wonder Land podcast, Kim launched into a few examples of why the theory is still floating around out there.

""Why does Buzz Aldrin say it didn't happen? There's no gravity on the moon,"" she listed, adding in reference to images, ""Why is the flag blowing? The shoes that they have in the museum that they wore on the moon is a different print in the photos. Why are there no stars?""

And for those who thinks she's ""crazy"" for even suggesting such a notion, Kim isn't fazed.

""They're going to say I'm crazy no matter what,"" she said. ""But go to TikTok, see for yourself.""

Indeed, rumors that the moon landing isn't real have persisted for years, with many believing 2001: A Space Odyssey director Stanley Kubrick was behind the fake out. But when it comes to Buzz's alleged claim, that stems from an interview he did with Conan O' Brien in 2000. 

After Conan revealed he remembers watching Neil and Buzz land on the moon, Buzz can heard telling the talk show host that he “didn't,” adding that “there wasn't any television, there wasn't anybody taking the picture.”

However, as Reuters—who fact-checked and debunked the suggestion in 2022—noted, Buzz was referring to the type of media (animation) shown around that time, clarifying that Conan was likely watching a recreation of sorts and not live TV.

As for Buzz himself, he's not only had a fierce reaction to naysayers but earlier this year, he even celebrated the 56th anniversary of the historic event with a heartfelt message.

“I couldn't be prouder to have completed this mission with the hundreds of thousands of people that helped get us to the moon and back home,” he tweeted in July, in part. “God bless the USA and all of humankind.”

Taylor Swift's Wildest Belly Button Dreams

In the 2010s, fans noticed the “Lavender Haze” singer's affinity for high-waisted pants, prompting an online wave of conspiracies, including that she was an alien born without a belly button.

Taylor even addressed the reason she kept her navel out of the spotlight.

“I don't like showing my belly button,” she told Lucky magazine in 2014. “I want that to be a mystery. As far as anyone knows based on my public appearances, they haven't seen evidence of a belly button. It could be pierced. They have no idea. If I'm going to get some sort of massive tattoo, it's going to be right next to my belly button because no one's ever going to see that.”

However, after paparazzi snapped pics of the singer and her friends wearing bikinis while vacationing in 2015, she ultimately posted snaps of herself in the swimsuit to Instagram. 

“We realize, ‘Okay so they got pictures of us in our bikinis, like I don't want them to make like $100,000 for stalking us,'” Taylor recounted on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast Show in 2015. “So we're like, ‘Get up on the bow of the boat, we're taking better bikini shots, so they don't make as much money on theirs.'” 

Did Avril Lavigne Actually Die in the Early 2000s?

The “Sk8er Boi” rocker reacted to online theories that she died in the early aughts and was replaced by a doppelganger named Melissa, who supposedly was hired before the singer's “death” to stand in for her at public events due to Avril's exhaustion. 

“I mean, it's just funny to me,” the “Complicated” singer said on a May 2024 episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast. “On one end, everyone's like, ‘You look the exact same. You haven't aged a day.' But then other people are like, there's a conspiracy theory that I'm not me.”

Beyoncé Shuts Down Fake Pregnancy Rumors 

Though the Grammy winner—who is now mom to daughter Blue Ivy and twins Rumi and Sir with husband Jay-Z—iconically debuted her first pregnancy during a performance at the 2011 MTV VMAs, she became the subject of theories that she wore a fake belly bump and enlisted a surrogate.

“That was crazy. It wasn't hurtful, it was just crazy,” she told People in 2012, per The Hollywood Reporter. “Where did they come up with this?”

Fans thought Beyoncé's baby bump appeared to deflate during an appearance on an Australian TV show months prior, which the singer shot down as “stupid, ridiculous and false” through a rep at the time. 

Is Anne Hathaway's Husband the Reincarnation of William Shakespeare?

The Oscar winner reacted to the comparison that her husband Adam Shulman looks extremely similar to the 16th century playwright—whose wife was also named Anne Hathaway—which has prompted fans online to believe the Romeo and Juliet author has been reincarnated.

“It would be great if it was true,” the Princess Diaries star said during a 2023 appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, “but even if it's not [it's] still kinda great.” 

Katy Perry Reacts to Theory She's Actually JonBenét Ramsey

The “Last Friday Night” singer—who was born in 1984—chimed in with her thoughts on the conspiracy that the Colorado-native—born in 1990 and murdered in 1996—was not actually beaten and strangled to death, but actually grew up to become the music superstar.

On a February 2025 Instagram post of the theory, Katy simply commented, “wait am i.”

Stevie Wonder Addresses Rumor He's Not Really Blind

The “Isn't She Lovely” singer—who was born prematurely and is blind as a result of retinopathy of prematurity, a condition that impacts eye growth and causes the retinas to detach—debunked the longstanding rumor that he can actually see during a July 2025 concert in the U.K.

""You know there have been rumors about me seeing and all that? But seriously, you know the truth,"" Stevie told the crowd, as seen in a fan's Instagram video. ""Truth is, shortly after my birth, I became blind.”

The Grammy winner considers his blindness a gift, though, adding, ""Now, that was a blessing because it's allowed me to see the world in the vision of truth, of sight. See people in the spirit of them, not how they look. Not what color they are, but what color is their spirit?""

Fox News host Will Cain grilled retired astronaut Eileen Collins on various conspiracies on the moon landing in an interview Friday

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Fox News host Will Cain grilled retired astronaut Eileen Collins on various conspiracies on the moon landing, claiming that 25 percent of his viewership still believed it to have been faked.

“I hear your affirmative case and I don't deny your affirmative case. I don't come to you today — this is not a debate and I would not even classify myself as a skeptic,” Cain told Collins in an interview Friday.

“But I do know that skeptics remain. Twenty-five percent of our viewers right now remain skeptical, so I wanted to have you address some of those arguments that are the sources of the skepticism.”

Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins piloted Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, with Armstrong and Aldrin becoming the first two humans to walk on its surface. The mission was a defining moment in the space race between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union.

Collins, who was the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle and the first to command a Space Shuttle mission, chuckled in response but addressed the points Cain laid out.

This included how a 1969 telephone call between then-president Richard Nixon, Armstrong and Aldrin had been made, prior to the advent of cellular mobile technology, how the American flag was waving in the famous footage of the landing, and the direction of the shadows also seen in the footage.

In response, Collins added that the moon landings were unprecedented historical events and that no one had known what was going to happen when the first men stepped outside the space shuttle.

“No one had ever been to the moon before, and now they're taking a tremendous risk to their lives… and decades, 50 years later, we say it didn't happen. I think that's really an insult to the people that made the Apollo program happen,” she said.

Cain shot back: I totally understand that argument, Eileen, but the point of our conversation is actually to address some of that skepticism and see if it doesn't hold weight, and the affirmative argument you're making is one that I find compelling as well. 

“These men were heroes. However, the points — points are still made and they're worth addressing as is always the case in anyone who has a counter argument. It's not the dismissal of the counter argument, it's the response to the counter argument that is powerful.”

NASA recently responded publicly to reality TV star Kim Kardashian, after she claimed she did not believe the moon landings had happened during a recent episode of her reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Writing on X, NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote: “Yes, @KimKardashian, we've been to the Moon before… 6 times!

“And even better: @NASAArtemis is going back under the leadership of @POTUS. We won the last space race and we will win this one too.”

Whether we report having dreams in color or in black and white may be influenced by the media we watch, or perhaps that simply influences the way we remember them.

We dream every night, but we often can't remember those dreams. Some mornings, we recall vivid details, and other days, we piece together hazy outlines. But what about color? Do most people dream in color or in black and white?

Some people may be surprised to learn that this has proved a divisive question. Modern research has indicated that television and films have a lot to do with how we experience dreaming and what we can remember when we wake up.

""Since we're used to colored media, we think dreams must be kind of like watching a movie or watching something on YouTube,"" Eric Schwitzgebel, a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Riverside, told Live Science. ""Those things are colored, so we tend to assume that dreams are too.""

But that hasn't always been the case. Up until the 1960s, researchers thought people largely dreamed in black and white, and surveys have backed this hypothesis. A small study of 277 people published in 1942 found that 70.7% of the college sophomores surveyed rarely or never saw colors in their dreams. Nearly 60 years later, Schwitzgebel asked a group of 124 college students the same questions — and the results had shifted drastically. In the more recent survey, less than 20% of the students surveyed reported rarely or never seeing colors in their dreams.

Other recent studies have produced similar results. Researchers have discovered a pattern: People born before the advent of color television and movies were much more likely to report having monochromatic dreams than people born after. This suggests that the way we interpret our dreams is affected by the types of media we consume.

Entertainment isn't the only factor. Much of what we take away from our nightly dreams has to do with how accurately we remember them and which details stick with us the most.

""Dreams are defined as subjective experiences during sleep, and the only way we can get to them is if the person is remembering them after waking up,"" Michael Schredl, head of the sleep laboratory at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Germany, told Live Science. ""The main problem is, 'how good are you at recalling?'""

Just as in waking life, the colors of objects can be quite forgettable if they match what we expect to see. For example, a yellow banana in a dream probably wouldn't leave a lasting impression.

""You don't think about it, and it's difficult to remember,"" Schredl said. But if a neon-pink banana appears in a dream, it might make more of an impact.

What's more, if a particular color is significant to a person, they may be more likely to remember it.

""If the color has a specific meaning for the person in her or his waking life, then it might be that the color might point to something,"" Schredl said. ""It's not about the color itself but how the color is affecting the person.""

—Do blind people 'see' images in their dreams?

—Can you dream during non-REM sleep?

—Do dreams really reveal our deepest secrets?

But Schwitzgebel argues that the question of whether we dream in black and white or color could be a bit misguided in the first place. When we imagine a scene in which the colors aren't important, our mental image may not be in black and white or in color; it may just be a fuzzy, ""indeterminate"" image. Or perhaps what we remember in the morning is slightly different from the mental image we had while dreaming, informed more by assumptions than memory. Dreams might be less of a visual, movie-like experience than we tend to assume, he said. Rather, it's possible our media consumption affects how we remember our dreams.

""A lot of people can't really quite get their minds around what it would mean for a dream experience to be neither colored nor black and white,"" he said.

Police say Ki-Shawn Crumity, 26, met girl through Snapchat, and charged him with human trafficking and sexual assault

A 13-year-old Louisiana girl who went missing after meeting a man online was found alive in a box at his home several states away in Pennsylvania – along with evidence that she had been sexually assaulted, according to authorities.

Ki-Shawn Crumity, 26, faces charges of human trafficking, sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of a child after police in Pittsburgh said they arrested him on Thursday. He is one of at least three men who had been arrested as of Saturday amid an investigation involving law enforcement agencies in multiple states.

“This child … was groomed, exploited and then sexually abused by strangers who found her online,” Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murrill, said in a statement on Friday. “This is just one example of the dangers of social media and of human trafficking.”

Officials reported that the teenager at the center of the case disappeared from Louisiana the previous week after meeting Crumity through social media. Investigators said they tracked her across several states – and by Thursday, after receiving information from federal agents, Pittsburgh police discovered the girl trapped in a sheet-covered box in Crumity's basement in the city's Brighton Park neighborhood.

The child was brought to a hospital, and there was evidence of sexual assault recovered, Guardian newsgathering partner WWL Louisiana reported, attributing that information to officials.

Citing a criminal complaint, Pittsburgh news outlet WTAE reported that the girl spoke to investigators in detail about what had happened to her. She purportedly said she connected with Crumity on the social media platform Snapchat – and that he promised he would help get her adopted by a trusted adult.

The child said she was able to get to Pittsburgh by taking a Greyhound bus – and once at Crumity's home, they slept in a bed in the basement along with a third person described as a woman, the criminal complaint explained.

Crumity further gave the girl edibles – a term used to describe food products infused with cannabis – and sexually assaulted her repeatedly for about a week, she told investigators, according to WTAE.

WTAE also said the criminal complaint quoted the girl as saying that the safest she ever felt was at the hospital where she was taken once authorities rescued her from Crumity's basement.

Crumity was denied bail after being booked into Pittsburgh's jail, police there said.

Two other men were also arrested in connection with the girl's temporary disappearance.

Ronald Smith, 62, was alleged to have been with the girl in Columbus, Georgia, and he is accused of simple kidnapping and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.

The third man – whose name was not immediately available – was arrested in New Orleans having allegedly admitted to being with the girl at the Greyhound bus station about 60 miles away in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that he personally apologized to US President Donald Trump for a regional government-commissioned commercial that used footage of Ronald Reagan to criticize trade tariffs.

The ad, commissioned by the government of Ontario, deeply “offended” Trump, Carney told journalists at a press conference in Gyeongju, South Korea on Saturday. He added he would not have approved its release had he been consulted.

The commercial aired earlier this month and spliced clips of Reagan's 1987 speech on trade policy and his use of tariffs against Japan to suggest that the late Republican icon opposed protectionism. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute accused Ontario of using the material without authorization and distorting Reagan's record.

Trump reacted angrily, accusing the Canadians of “egregious behavior” and announcing the suspension of ongoing trade talks with Ottawa. He also imposed additional tariffs on Canadian imports in response.

The US president revealed on Friday that Carney had reached out to apologize and was “very nice,” though the talks remained suspended. “Ronald Reagan loved tariffs – and they tried to make it look the other way,” he said.

Carney's remarks came after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which both leaders attended this week in South Korea.

Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces said several of its fighters had been detained as videos of mass executions and atrocities in el-Fasher circulate online.

Following global outcry over apparent atrocities during the capture of el-Fasher in North Darfur, Sudan's Rapid Support Forces said they had detained several RSF fighters.

Various extremely graphic videos have emerged since el-Fasher was seized over the weekend, appearing to show mass executions and other crimes being committed by RSF forces.

One of the detainees is believed to be a man known as ""Abu Lulu,"" who appears in multiple videos circulating online. He has been recorded carrying out executions of unarmed people, the French AFP news agency reported.

AFP said it had verified a clip in which Abu Lulu is seen firing at unarmed men at close range. Another shows him standing among dozens of corpses and burned vehicles.

The RSF released a video appearing to show Abu Lulu behind bars in what the group claimed to be a North Darfur prison.

The Centre for Information Resilience — an NGO that exposes human rights violations — announced that it has identified six different RSF fighters from the available video material, including Abu Lulu.

The CIR reported that it had analyzed footage emerging from el-Fasher and confirmed that ""mass killings are taking place.""

""The casualties likely include both combatants and civilians, as CIR identified women and men in civilian clothing among those killed,"" the NGO reported.

In a briefing to the United Nations Security Council, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher on Thursday said there were ""credible reports of widespread executions"" after the RSF entered el-Fasher.

""We cannot hear the screams, but... the horror is continuing,"" he said, adding there were reports of rapes, mutilations and killings with impunity.

Arjan Hehenkamp, crisis lead for Sudan at the International Rescue Committee, told DW the ""stories about dead bodies littering the road, wounded crying out for help, and people being executed"" from survivors. 

He said the international committee has to put pressure on the RSF's regional backers so that they ""pressure RSF into creating safe conditions for civilians, safe corridors for them to flee.""

El-Fasher is the capital of North Darfur State and was the Sudanese army's last stronghold in Darfur, amid a war with the RSF since April 2023, which has caused one of the biggest humanitarian crises worldwide.

Following an 18-month siege — marked by mass starvation and heavy bombardment — it fell to the RSF.

Shortly after, reports and videos of atrocities began circulating, with RSF fighters accused of massacring people they came upon.

El-Fasher has been cut off from all communications since its capture, but the AFP reported that survivors who managed to reach the nearby town of Tawila spoke of mass killings, children shot before their parents, and civilians beaten and robbed as they fled.

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario's premier not to run an anti-tariff advertisement that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to end trade talks with Canada.

Carney also confirmed that he apologized to the president during a dinner at the the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because Trump was “offended.” 

Ontario's television advertisement that aired in in the U.S. criticizes Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

The ad upset Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%. 

When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, “Well, you saw what came of it. It's not something I would have done.” 

Ford is a populist Conservative while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a U.S. governor. 

“I'm the one who is responsible, in my role as prime minister, for the relationship with the president of the U.S., and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the U.S. government,” added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.

A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad.

Ford previously said Carney and Carney's chief of staff watched the ad before it was released.




Ford pulled the ad last Monday but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the baseball World Series. 

Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against them. 

Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.

Carney met with Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.

More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.

Carney said Canada has to transform away from reliance on a single trade partner. He said his next move will be the federal budget on Nov. 4 when he will introduce measures to protect and diversify the economy. 

“We can spend our time watching Truth Social,” Carney said. Or, Canada can focus on what it can control, he said.

Fox News Digital spoke with federal defense attorney Ronald Chapman II about the high-profile New York strip club bribery and tax fraud case, where executives are accused of plying a state tax auditor with cash, Florida trips and lap dances.

A group of strip club executives allegedly bribed a New York state tax auditor with cash, luxury Florida trips and lap dances worth thousands of dollars a day to slash millions from their tax bills, according to a sweeping indictment by Attorney General Letitia James.

The 79-count indictment accuses top leaders of RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc., the Texas-based parent company behind strip clubs Rick's Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret and Hoops Cabaret, of using their venues to disguise bribes as ""promotional"" expenses and avoid more than $8 million in sales taxes between 2010 and 2024.

Prosecutors say the auditor received at least 13 all-expenses-paid trips to Florida, where the company's top leadership was allegedly given hotel rooms, restaurant meals and up to $5,000 per day for private dances at RCI-owned clubs.

Federal defense attorney Ronald Chapman II said the allegations, while ""sensational,"" may not prove criminal intent once tested in court.

""When you look a little deeper, things start to look a little bit different,"" Chapman told Fox News Digital. ""This case reminds me of the [President] Trump financial-fraud case, where prosecutors in New York built a sweeping narrative around business judgments that may not actually violate the law.""

Chapman said prosecutors face an uphill battle to prove a quid pro quo and that the auditor's decisions were directly influenced by the perks.

""It only turns into bribery when that is also done consistent with bad conduct, looking the other way on something,"" he said. ""I just don't see that other side of the quid pro quo yet.""

He also questioned the timing of the charges, pointing to the embattled attorney general.

""We see, once again, a very late indictment being brought. That means somebody brought this case from a pile of cases and decided to pluck it out,"" he said.

""Oftentimes we will see prosecutors right around the time they're about to be facing re-election, trying to bring big cases like this with sensational headlines where they don't really have the goods to fully handle the prosecution,"" he said.

LETITIA JAMES TO BE ARRAIGNED IN VIRGINIA ON FEDERAL BANK FRAUD CHARGES TIED TO 2020 HOME PURCHASE

James is facing one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The allegations stem from a home she purchased in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia.

Prosecutors say James misrepresented the property as a secondary residence on loan/mortgage documents, when in fact they allege she used it as a rental investment property, which qualified her for more favorable loan terms. She has pleaded not guilty.

The indictment, filed in New York County Supreme Court, names RCI Chief Executive Officer Eric Langan, Controller Timothy Winata, Chief Financial Officer Bradley Chhay, Operations Director Ahmed ""Ed"" Anakar, and Nightclub Operations Director Shaun Kevlin as defendants. A sixth individual has also been charged but was not identified because of the sealed indictment.

RCI and its three Manhattan-based clubs, Rick's Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret and Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, are also charged in the case, which includes counts of criminal tax fraud, bribery, conspiracy and filing false business records.

If convicted of the top counts, Langan, Winata and Anakar could each face up to 25 years in prison, while Chhay and Kevlin could face a maximum of 15 years.

James described the case as a blatant abuse of power by a publicly traded company seeking to skirt its tax obligations.

""RCI's executives shamelessly used their strip clubs to bribe their way out of paying millions of dollars in taxes,"" James said in a statement announcing the indictment. ""I will always take action to fight corruption and ensure everyone pays their fair share.""

The excavators that tore down the East Wing of the White House in a few days in October took the public and professional builders by surprise. With the 123-year-old structure gone, the scale of President Donald Trump's vision to replace it is leaving experts puzzled.

At 90,000 square feet — nearly two football fields — the new addition will dwarf the 55,000 square-foot mansion. It's also far more space than would typically be needed for a ballroom for the 1,000 guests Trump has said he wants the new room to hold. Official drawings show an ornate banquet hall, but its size suggests something more like a convention center space or hotel conference center. Officials say the structure will also include offices and other facilities, but haven't provided details.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Netherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia is at the heart of a standoff between the European Union, the U.S. and China that has triggered a near-crisis for global automakers.

The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, in October, citing national security concerns. The move prompted Beijing to block Nexperia products from leaving China.

Meetings are underway in Europe Saturday to attempt to defuse the escalating issue, and Chinese and U.S. authorities appear to be opening up a pathway for Nexperia's China-based operations to resume exporting critical automotive chips.

Spokespeople for the White House and Nexperia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

For now, however, the auto industry's supply chain still hangs in the balance.

The dispute is threatening vehicle production worldwide as automakers warn of looming shortages of the chipmaker's components, which are critical to basic electrical functions in cars and challenging to replace on short notice.

The battle has unfolded amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese-linked tech firms from Western governments, including the U.S., which recently tightened export-control rules to limit technology transfers to Chinese-owned entities.

Nexperia's owner, Wingtech, was put on a U.S. blacklist in December 2024 for its alleged role ""in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.""

Here's what to know about where the dispute stands, and why it matters. 

Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.

The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. 

Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year.

In late October, automakers, such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz, sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia's chip exports are curtailed for long.

While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight. 

In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property to another company it owned. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO, Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement.

Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies.

But signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge.

On Friday, reports said the U.S. plans to announce that Nexperia will resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, citing sources familiar with the matter. And on Saturday, China said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban. Chinese officials did not specify what those exemptions could entail.

""We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports,"" The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. 

If finalized, the exemptions could ease immediate pressure on automakers. But the broader dispute over ownership, technology control and security oversight remains unresolved.

American fast-food chain Steak ‘n Shake has announced the formation of a new Bitcoin treasury, built with the Bitcoin made from its restaurants' sales. 

“All payments received in Bitcoin will be placed in our [strategic Bitcoin reserve],” said Steak ‘n Shake in a post on X on Friday, which garnered strong support from the Bitcoin community.

The company added that for every Bitcoin meal it sells, 210 sats (around $0.23) will be donated to nonprofit OpenSats, which supports contributors to Bitcoin Core and open source Bitcoin development.

How much Bitcoin could Steak ‘n Shake scoop up? 

Steak ‘n Shake has not disclosed how much of its restaurants' sales are made in Bitcoin since it began accepting BTC payments across its US locations in May. Many other fast food chains that accept Bitcoin via third-party services also do not disclose this information. 

However, Steak ‘n Shake's revenue figures could provide some hints as to how much the company could realistically accumulate in Bitcoin each quarter. 

In the second quarter of 2025, Steak ‘n Shake reported revenue of $69.3 million — a 12% increase year over year. At the time, the company praised Bitcoiners for helping it secure a 10.7% quarter-on-quarter rise in same-store sales. This momentum continued in the third quarter as same-store sales grew by 15%. 

Both figures suggest that Bitcoiners comprise only a small (but growing) percentage of their customer base and sales, meaning Bitcoin accumulation will likely be slow compared to Bitcoin-focused treasury companies or Bitcoin miners. 

There are, of course, other benefits to accepting Bitcoin. In May, Steak ‘n Shake said it saves roughly 50% in processing fees compared to when customers use credit cards. 

Get paid Bitcoin when you buy a burger

Meanwhile, Steak ‘n Shake also announced a partnership with Fold that will give customers $5 in BTC when they buy a Steak ‘n Shake “Bitcoin Meal” or “Bitcoin Steakburger,” using the receipt to redeem it in the Fold app. 

“Bitcoin goes mainstream when it starts showing up in everyday life,” said Will Reeves, chairman, founder and CEO of Fold. 

“That's been our vision from the beginning, and our promotion with Steak 'n Shake is the next step in that journey. For many people, this will be the first time they ever own Bitcoin, and it will come from something as ordinary as grabbing a burger. That's what real adoption looks like.”

The limited-time offer will be available across approximately 400 locations across the United States.

The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is already the second-longest in the nation's history, and may break the record for longest next week. That isn't promising for crypto legislation's chances of actually becoming law in the near future.



You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.





The U.S. government shut down on Oct. 1, 2025 after Congress was unable to come to an agreement to continue funding it. The long shutdown in U.S. history is 35 days — if the current one lasts through Wednesday, it will break that record.

Crypto legislation has been almost at a standstill since before the government shut down, but the longer the shutdown lasts, the dimmer the prospects for legislation to move through are.

The ongoing shutdown means Congress has already missed several of its self-imposed deadlines for passing legislation — most recently the tentative Oct. 20 deadline for a markup hearing on market structure legislation. Time is starting to run out to move other pieces of legislation.



As we get closer to the end of the year, Congress will have priorities other than crypto to deal with, said Wintermute Head of Policy and Advocacy Ron Hammond, who pointed to the annual National Defense Authorization Act — a must-pass military spending bill — as an example.



However, he said there was still optimism in Washington, D.C. that crypto legislation that stalled out near the end of the summer will see some movement. The next thing to watch for may be the Senate Agriculture Committee's draft market structure bill, as that could indicate where the overall legislative package may go.



If the feedback to that draft is positive, lawmakers could quickly head toward a markup hearing around Thanksgiving and vote soon after.



A complicating factor is the shutdown. The longer it lasts, the less time there is for Congress to deal with these different legislative issues.



Another individual familiar with D.C. politicking told CoinDesk on Thursday that there is a rumor that Democrats may give up on their demands to secure lower healthcare premiums within the next week or so due to the Trump Administration's refusal to distribute Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to recipients during the shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the administration to resume benefits regardless.



If this happens, this individual also said there may be a markup by Thanksgiving — but if Democrats are forced to give in on their demands around the shutdown, they may be less willing to compromise on market structure legislation.



Next week will also see another election, where voters will choose a number of statewide ballot initiatives, representatives, mayors and governors in the states of Virginia and New Jersey.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251101000423.htm","Sat, 01 Nov 2025 12:29:32 GMT","

Forget the old idea that physical activity drains your supply of heartbeats. New research from Australia shows that people who are physically fit actually use fewer heartbeats each day, which may help them live longer.

According to the study, athletes had an average heart rate of 68 beats per minute (bpm), while non-athletes averaged 76 bpm. Over a 24-hour period, this equals roughly 97,920 beats for athletes compared to 109,440 for non-athletes -- about 10 percent fewer.

""That's an incredible saving of about 11,500 beats a day,"" says Professor La Gerche, head of the HEART Laboratory supported by the St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research (SVI) and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute (VCCRI).

He adds, ""Even though athletes' hearts work harder during exercise, their lower resting rates more than make up for it.""

Exercise Efficiency and Heart Health

The study, published in JACC: Advances, found that the most physically fit individuals had resting heart rates as low as 40 bpm, compared to the typical 70-80 bpm range. This means that, despite higher peaks during training, athletes still end up with fewer total beats across the day than those who are inactive.

These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it.

""The fitter you are, the more metabolically efficient your body becomes,"" Professor La Gerche explains. ""Even if you're training hard for an hour a day, your heart beats more slowly for the other 23 hours. The net effect is fewer beats used overall.""

A slower resting heart rate is not only a sign of good physical condition but also a strong indicator of long-term health. Increasing physical activity, when done safely, can enhance heart performance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

""Exercise is strongly linked with improved mental health, longer lifespan and lower rates of heart disease,"" Professor La Gerche says.

Moderate Exercise Delivers the Biggest Benefits

Although extreme endurance events such as the Tour de France can cause temporary increases in daily heartbeats, Professor La Gerche notes that the health benefits of consistent, moderate exercise far outweigh any risks.

""The biggest bang for your health buck is going from unfit to moderately fit. Just a few hours of purposeful exercise each week can transform your heart's efficiency and help make every beat count. It may even extend your life by years,"" he says.

About the HEART Lab

Professor La Gerche leads the Heart, Exercise & Research Trials (HEART) Lab, which investigates how exercise influences heart health, in partnership with SVI and VCCRI. By studying elite athletes, the team uncovers findings that reach well beyond sports performance, offering valuable insights for people living with serious heart conditions.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Generative AI has made its way onto the professional soccer field.

Laura Harvey, head coach of Seattle Reign FC, said this week that ChatGPT helped her come up with a new defensive strategy.

Speaking on the Soccerish Podcast, Harvey said she was curious if ChatGPT could answer questions about soccer. So she started prompting OpenAI's chatbot with questions about her team.

At first, she asked broad questions like, “what is Seattle Reign's identity?” She didn't really love the answer. 

But then she asked: “What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?”

It then listed every team in the women's soccer professional league, with a suggested formation. And for two of the teams, it suggested “back-five,” a defensive setup using five players in the backline.

Harvey said she wasn't super familiar with the strategy and had not used it as a coach. 

She took the AI suggestion to her staff and did a deep dive on the potential change.

“We liked it,” Harvey said. “And it worked — we won the game.”

Harvey, a three-time NWSL Coach of the Year, didn't reveal the opponent but said they were “really good.” Now the team uses the formation as an option during matches. The Reign have improved since last season and are ranked fourth in the NWSL heading into the playoffs. 

It's a fascinating example of using AI as a tactical consultant, combining human expertise and intuition with machine suggestions. 

“It didn't tell you how to play it, what to do in it or any of that stuff,” Harvey said on the podcast. “But it was like, ‘This is what we would say to do.' And I was like, ‘Hmm, interesting.' And that was what spurred me to look into it. So then I really looked into it.”

Across industries, professionals are treating tools such as ChatGPT as sounding boards — running ideas by them, exploring scenarios, or pressure-testing strategies before making decisions. 

OpenAI's own research this year found that people increasingly rely on ChatGPT “as an advisor rather than only for task completion.”

“ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making,” according to the research.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

There is still time to complete a solar install yourself and get federal+state tax breaks. Call up your energy provider, get connected to their distributed generation department, and submit the forms/documentation/plans they require. Then you build your system, get it inspected, the utility approves it and completes the hookup. ChatGPT makes all this fairly easy. I can upload my forms and the process to GitHub if anyone wants to see the process for NY state.The simplest grid-tied system is solar panels + roof-mounting equipment + microinverters + a combiner box + a disconnect switch. This is enough to send solar power direct to the grid, assuming your microinverter supports the standards your power utility requires. You can do a PV+ESS (battery) system, but it's a ton more expensive (even assuming you DIY). It should be cheaper to do grid-tied projects, but many power utilities now mandate new standards for grid-tied devices that only the expensive inverters support.If you do off-grid (which I believe there's still some tax breaks for, depending), you can build a PV+ESS system much cheaper, as the off-grid equipment doesn't require the more expensive standards. We're talking $3.5k vs $9k for the same system.It would also be cheaper if we supported balcony solar the way Germany does. A big concern of mine is that poor people and people in apartments (~40% of Americans live in apartments) won't have the ability to supplement their bills with solar. If all the people with money and land/houses switch to solar, and the poor can't, the poor'll be propping up a big portion of the energy sector themselves, which is unsustainable.

We are struggling with this also -- with or without an incentive. The payback period is long. Makes sense if you think forward rates will be super-high.

But this is a warranty, and you have many panels. If they're all going to fail, they will fail sooner. If one fails or breaks eventually, even if it's not under warranty, replacing the panel is dirt cheap. Of course you need to replace it with an identical panel, so it makes more sense to buy extra panels and just assume some will die. But even if you paid for a replacement, that's already just $100-$200, and it'll probably be cheaper in the future.So the warranty isn't really that important long-term. They're more important for the short term, and a Tier 1 solar provider's so reliable that you don't really need it anyway.

The Latest | Nov 01, 2025

KANSAS CITY (Nov. 1, 2025) – The final regular season match of what has been the most decorated season in club history thus far takes place Sunday, Nov. 2, when the Kansas City Current (20-3-2, 1st place, 62 pts.) hosts the San Diego Wave (10-8-7, 5th place, 37 pts) for Week 26 of National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) action. The NWSL Decision Day contest kicks off at 2 p.m. CT at CPKC Stadium. The game will serve as Fan Appreciation Day and limited tickets are available for purchase HERE.

The match will broadcast nationally on ESPN with Jordan Angeli and Mark Donaldson on the call as well as on the World Feed with Jessica Charman and Gary Bailey. Fans in Kansas City can tune in to 90.9 The Bridge to hear Jillian Carroll Letrinko and Dave Borchardt call the action and the KC Current App will also have an audio stream of the match in English, Spanish and Portuguese.

HONORING HAMMY
Kansas City Current forward Kristen Hamilton has announced her retirement from professional soccer, capping off a remarkable career which has included three NWSL championships and four NWSL Shields. Hamilton, who has been with Kansas City since its inaugural season in 2021, will hang up her boots at the conclusion of the 2025 campaign. The Current will celebrate Hamilton's illustrious career on Nov. 2 at CPKC Stadium during a post-match ceremony.

A decorated veteran of the league, Hamilton has logged over 10,200 career minutes across all competitions, including 5,344 with the Current. She has 41 career goals and 14 assists in 184 appearances across all competitions. Twenty-six goals and 12 assists have been recorded in her 147 career regular season appearances, highlighted by 10 goals and two assists in 53 regular season games for Kansas City. Hamilton is one of four players in NWSL history who have been on four Shield-winning teams and she ranks second all-time with eight total NWSL trophies. She was also the first of only two players in league history to have played in five NWSL championship finals.

WATER WAR
Sunday will be the eighth edition of the “Water War” between the Current and the Wave with Kansas City leading the series at 5-1-1. Kansas City has won the last four meetings with San Diego and is 2-1 at home. The Wave is one of seven teams the Current has an active regular season winning streak of three or more matches against along with Angel City FC, Bay FC, Chicago Stars, Racing Louisville FC, Portland Thorns and Utah Royals FC.

The last meeting between the two sides was a 2-0 Current win in San Diego on April 12 for the club's first-ever shutout over the Wave. Midfielder Debinha scored her 50th career regular season goal in the 16th minute off an assist from defender Izzy Rodriguez before midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta converted her penalty kick nine minutes later.

TOP-RANKED JUNIOR  
Midfielder Claire Hutton was recently ranked No. 1 on ESPN's list of top Under-19 players in the NWSL. As stated in the article, “Hutton is a brave, two-way midfielder who can protect the back line with crunching tackles and spark the attack with progressive passes. Get ready to see her at the 2027 World Cup and beyond for the USWNT.” At 19 years old, Hutton is in her second year as a professional and has played in all but one regular season matches this year. She currently ranks sixth on the team with 1,739 minutes and leads the roster with 41 tackles won, having also dished out a pair of assists. She was one of three teenagers called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for the latest FIFA international window, and the only teen to appear in all three matches.

DEBINHA DOMINATION
Midfielder Debinha was named to the short list for the 2025 FIFPRO Women's World 11, the only global football award decided exclusive by professional footballers. She is one of 26 women's finalists who received the most votes from their peers for their performances from Aug. 11, 2024, to Aug. 3, 2025, with a minimum of 20 matches played. In that time period, Debinha has amassed nine goals and five assists for the Kansas City Current. She became one of four players in NWSL history to be on four Shield-winning teams, and she ranks second all-time with eight NWSL trophies. The Brazilian is tied for third among all goal scorers across all competititons in NWSL history with 78 goals. The final World 11 list will be announced on Monday, Nov. 3.

TOP OF THE TABLE 
The Current remains at the top of the NWSL table for the 21st week in a row with 62 points and a 20-3-2 record. The club's 19th win of the regular season on Oct. 6 set a new NWSL record, snapping the previous mark of 18 from Orlando and Washington in 2024. Kansas City then became the first team to reach the 20-win threshold on Oct. 11. The win over Gotham FC on Oct. 11 also brought the Current's point total up to 62 in the NWSL standings, officially breaking the Orlando Pride's record of 60 from 2024 for most points in a single regular season. Kansas City is averaging 2.48 points per match through Week 25 and is on track to eclipse North Carolina's NWSL record for most points per match in a regular season of 2.38 set in 2018. The Current also checked in at No. 5 in the latest Opta Power Rankings from Oct. 30 with a score of 92.2. The next closest NWSL team, Gotham, was ranked 10th with a score of 87.6.

DYNAMITE DEFENSE
Kansas City has conceded just 12 goals with one regular season match left to play. No team in NWSL history has allowed fewer than 17 goals over a full year, regardless of season length. The Current has allowed 0.48 goals per game through Week 25. The only other team that is conceding less than one goal per game on average is Gotham FC, which has given up 0.88 goals per game. Kansas City's stalwart defense is anchored by Brazilian netminder Lorena, whose 14th clean sheet on Oct. 11 broke Orlando's Anna Moorhouse's NWSL record of 13 for most goalkeeper shutouts in a single regular season. Lorena's 14 clean sheets not only extend her own single-season franchise record but set a new club mark for regular season career shutouts. The previous career mark was set over four years, and Lorena's in her first season with the Current.

INTERNATIONAL ROUNDUP
Several KC Current players were busy during the October FIFA international window. Forward Nichelle Prince subbed in during the 76th minute in Canada's 1-0 loss to Switzerland on Oct. 24 and played the last 25 minutes in a 1-0 defeat to the Netherlands four days later. Forward Bia Zaneratto scored the opening goal in the ninth minute before dishing out the game-winning assist nine minutes later during Brazil's 2-1 win vs. England on Oct. 25 before goalkeeper Lorena secured a 1-0 shutout over Italy on Oct. 28. Lorena started both matches in net and made a combined seven saves while Zaneratto started the first contest and subbed in during the second.

Four Current players represented the U.S. Women's National Team during the break. In a 2-1 loss to Portugal on Oct. 23, forward Michelle Cooper started and logged 69 minutes while midfielder Claire Hutton subbed in during the second half. The Stars and Stripes responded on Oct. 26 with a 3-1 win over Portugal. Forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor registered her third career assist in the 82nd minute and played a full match as Hutton joined the starting lineup and logged 77 minutes. The first-ever USWNT match at CPKC Stadium took place Oct. 29 vs. New Zealand for a 6-0 U.S. win which saw Cooper and Hutton in the Starting XI logging 67 and 46 minutes, respectively. Cooper served up a pair of assists and midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta entered the match for the final 23 minutes.

Additionally, a trio of young KC Current players in forwards Mary Long and Alex Pfeiffer along with defender Katie Scott participated in a U.S. Under-20 National Team training camp during the international break. The training camp was held in Kansas City at The University of Kansas Health System Training Center, the Current's training site.

The KC Current made history on Sept. 20 by winning the 2025 NWSL Shield, presented by CarMax, following its 2-0 win over Seattle Reign FC at CPKC Stadium. This is the first time in franchise history the Current has won the Shield, which is awarded to the club with the best record during the regular season. The Current has remained at the top of the table since Week 6, and now no other team can surpass Kansas City in the league standings.

Kansas City became the fastest club to win the Shield in NWSL history, doing so with five regular season games left in the 2025 campaign. The previous record for fastest to clinch was with four matches remaining done by Seattle in 2014, North Carolina in 2018 and Portland in 2021. The Current is the seventh different Shield winner in the league's 13-year history. Head coach Vlatko Andonovski, who has won two NWSL championships and has twice been named the NWSL Coach of the Year, has now added the NWSL Shield to his decorated resume for the first time in his career.

PLAYERS TO WATCH 
Kansas City defender Izzy Rodriguez – Rodriguez is tied for the league lead with six assists on the year. Her next regular season assist would set a new club single season record with seven and a new club record for career assists with 12. She is the only player on the roster who has appeared in all 25 matches and, if she plays Sunday, could become the first Kansas City Current player to ever play 26 matches in a season. Rodriguez, who scored her first goal of the year in Week 18, also leads the Current with 25 successful open play crosses and 54 corners. Her 1,986 minutes is third on the squad.

San Diego forward Delphine Cascarino – Cascarino paces San Diego with 11 goal contributions behind a team-leading five goals and six assists, the latter which is tied for first in the NWSL and set a new club record. She has had a goal contribution in three straight matches for the second time this season, equaling the longest single season streak in Wave history. She is the only San Diego player to contribute a goal in four consecutive regular season matches overall, doing so spanning the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Cascarino has started 22 of her 23 matches this season and ranks fifth on the roster with 1,896 minutes.

FAN APPRECIATION MATCH  
As the 2025 regular season draws to a close, the Current will celebrate the best fans in the NWSL during Fan Appreciation Day on Nov. 2 with special merchandise opportunities and giveaways.

In the red-clay hills east of Guadalajara, where endless rows of blue agave ripple toward the horizon, the next chapter of Jalisco's tequila story is taking shape. The state has unveiled the Los Altos Tequila Route, a new tourism corridor that links eight highland towns known for producing some of Mexico's distinctive tequilas and for keeping alive the rural tradition behind them.

The announcement coincided with the Spirits Selection by Concours Mondial de Bruxelles. This international tasting event brought producers and judges to Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta and several of the state's Pueblos Mágicos. With Guadalajara preparing to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Jalisco's tourism officials see an opportunity to set part of that global spotlight on the region's agricultural interior.

For more than a decade, the original Tequila Route west of Guadalajara has drawn visitors to the namesake town and surrounding UENSCO-listed agave fields. The new Los Altos circuit turns the focus eastward, to higher elevations, where the soil is rich with iron and the cooler climate yields sweeter, fruit-forward agaves.

The route connects Acatic, Tepatitlán, San Ignacio Cerro Gordo, Arandas, Jesús María, Atotonilco El Alto, Ayotlán and Tototlán, communities that together offer more than 1,600 rooms, 530 restaurants and 75 organized visitor experiences. Travelers can tour small-batch distilleries, stay at family haciendas or join workshops that walk them through every stage of tequila production, from hand-harvesting the piñas to barrel aging and tasting.

Among the signature stops is the forthcoming Clase Azul Interpretive Museum and Los González Reserve, which plans to combine horseback rides through agave plantations with interpretive exhibits exploring the craftsmanship behind the brand's ceramic bottles. In Arandas, construction has begun on Mundo de Don Julio, a cultural complex that will include a restaurant, museum and guided experiences celebrating one of Mexico's most recognized labels.

To the south, El Tesoro de los Altos by Campo Azul is being developed as a countryside retreat with cabins overlooking the fields, ATV excursions, and blending workshops led by local distillers. Nearby, Farm-to-Table by Tequila San Matías will showcase regional ingredients — corn, goat cheese, chiles and fresh herbs — served with tequila pairings and talks on sustainable agriculture. And at Casa Loy, outside Tepatitlán, chefs are designing menus that connect contemporary Mexican cooking with traditional highland spirits.

These plans are all part of the tourism board's greater design to expand the state's tourism sectors beyond the coastal resorts and Guadalajara, especially as the state braces for an influx of tourists during the World Cup.

Tequila's tourism appeal is undeniable. Tequila received 1.2 million visitors in 2023, a 19% increase from 2019. While that period includes the pandemic years, when international travel slowed, it's worth noting that Mexico was one of the few countries to keep its borders open. As a result, domestic and regional travel surged, and destinations like Tequila saw massive growth.

For a small town, 1.2 million annual visitors is a significant number, and it signals a clear appetite for spirits-based tourism. The question now is whether the Los Altos corridor can capture a share of that interest and disperse it more evenly across the state.

Jalisco as a whole is riding a wave of momentum. In the first trimester of 2025, the state recorded 11 million visitors. Puerto Vallarta alone receives about two million travelers per year, while Guadalajara welcomed roughly 16 million in 2024. The new highlands circuit could help balance that flow, but whether it can divert enough travelers from established destinations to make a measurable difference in overcrowding remains to be seen.

What's clear, however, is that there is real demand for tequila-related experiences, and the highlands offer a way to expand the narrative beyond one small, over-visited town. 

State officials expect the Los Altos route to be fully operational by the time the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins. Guadalajara will serve as one of Mexico's three host cities, and tourism authorities estimate that the tournament could bring an additional five million visitors nationwide and generate several billion dollars in tourism spending.

By opening up a new tourism corridor, the plan is to help thin out the rush of crowds who will surely flood Guadalajara and the beaches around the Bay of Banderas. Road improvements, new signage, and a digital map are in the works to make the circuit easier for self-guided travelers.

Tequila remains one of Mexico's most lucrative exports, generating nearly US $4 billion in 2024, according to the Tequila Regulatory Council. But much of that profit still flows to large-scale producers. The Los Altos initiative aims to integrate smaller distilleries, agave farmers and local entrepreneurs into the formal tourism network.

Community cooperatives and municipal governments are collaborating on training programs for guides, restaurateurs and homestay owners to help professionalize services while keeping management local. 

The highlands of Jalisco were inscribed by UNESCO in 2006 as part of the Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila. Preserving that legacy has become central to the route's long-term vision. 

Participating distilleries are adopting water-recycling systems, composting agave waste and restoring native vegetation around their fields. Many of the new visitor programs include lessons on biodiversity and reforestation. The state's Sustainable Tourism Council has said that it will oversee certification to ensure that growth does not compromise environmental standards.

Los Altos is one element of a larger push to diversify Jalisco's food and beverage tourism. Along the Pacific coast, the Raicilla Route continues to expand, introducing travelers to the lesser-known smoky spirit native to Jalisco. Two wine routes are also being developed in the highlands. 

Together, these projects are pointing to a new phase in Jalisco's tourism model, one that has traditionally relied on sun-and-sand tourism. For travelers, the Los Altos Tequila Route is a window into the landscapes and the personalities behind Mexico's national drink. Visitors driving the route will pass small roadside distilleries, open-air markets and fields where jimadores still harvest by hand.

As the countdown to the World Cup continues, Jalisco is betting that these quiet hills will draw as much curiosity as the crowds in the stadium of Guadalajara. For the communities of Los Altos, the hope is that attention may bring recognition and a more sustainable future.

Ben Fordesman lensed Ronan Day-Lewis' directorial debut, starring his father, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Sean Bean.

Europe Bureau Chief


Anemone, the directorial debut of Ronan Day-Lewis, featuring the return to the big screen of his three-time Oscar-winning father Daniel Day-Lewis, will open this year's Camerimage film festival, the world's leading fest devoted to the art of cinematography.


Daniel Day-Lewis plays Ray, a hermit who has spent the last 20 years away from humanity, in a cabin deep in the woods, nursing the trauma he suffered as a child. His solitude is interrupted by the arrival of his brother Jem (Sean Bean), who is looking for a connection with his son Brian (Samuel Bottomley), and seeking Ray's help.

Anemone premiered at the New York Film Festival, where it was praised by The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief reviewer David Rooney, for Day-Lewis' “riveting performance” and the stunning visuals of Cinematographer Ben Fordesman, whose “arresting widescreen images of the Northern English landscapes and dense woodlands create a sweeping canvas.”

	“Anemone exemplifies the kind of filmmaking that defines the spirit of EnergaCAMERIMAGE,” the festival said in a statement. “Cinema where image and emotion intertwine to create a profound artistic experience.”


	Fordesman's other credits include Rose Glass' Saint Maud and Love Lies Bleeding, and Dylan Southern's The Thing With Feathers. 


Anemone completes the 2025 Camerimage lineup. The festival unveiled the rest of its competition titles Wednesday. Some of the most visually arresting movies of the year — Ryan Coogler's Sinners, shot by Autumn Durald Arkapaw; Chloé Zhao's Hamnet, photographed by Lukasz Zal; Joseph Kosinski's F1: The Movie, lensed by Claudio Miranda; James Mangold's A Complete Unknown, shot by Phedon Papamichael; and Kathryn Bigelow's A House of Dynamite, filmed by Barry Ackroyd — are among the titles in the running for this year's Golden Frog award for best film.

	











	The 2025 Camerimage festival runs Nov. 15-23 in Toruń, Poland.

	As YouTube TV‘s carriage talks leave many sports fans without access to their favorite college teams, ESPN is addressing the issue.


	The sports media company is making its pregame show College GameDay available for free on X and the ESPN mobile app immediately after it was one of several Disney networks to go dark on the platform ahead of the company's contract expiration.


	Available via X's live video function, with access including replays and bonus content, while the ESPN app offers push notifications and highlight clips, according to Cord Cutters.

	With Disney's networks going dark Thursday on YouTube TV, Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman joined ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro in expressing that YouTube TV and parent company Google are “not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,” in a memo to employees.

	











	“Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service,” they added.


	Meanwhile, a YouTube executive has told Deadline that Disney has been “unnecessarily aggressive and assertive” in the talks, but someone at Disney said that YouTube TV is “intentionally misrepresenting the situation.”

As long as someone's footing the bill!

Lily Allen says her OnlyFans followers most often request pictures of her feet in socks — sometimes dirty, sometimes clean — or ask to choose the color of her toenail polish. 

The Brit singer started an account on the smut streaming site last year after realizing that others online were cashing in on her tootsies, and deciding she's rather have the cash herself.

But in a new interview with Interview magazine, Allen revealed what her foot-fiend followers usually crave.

“They want dirty soles, white socks, like schoolgirl socks or ankle socks, some clean, some dirty,” she told Interview's editor-in-chief Mel Ottenberg, “White socks in Mary Jane shoes. Stepping in food. Toe spreading, because that's what happens when you're climaxing.”

The “LDN” singer — who has a new album, West End Girl, out now — said that, in fact, many foot fans are as interesting in the shoes as the feet themselves.

Meanwhile, she said that, while some feet freaks like to her see her rubbing oil on them, many are fixated on the nails.

“That's the other thing they pay money for—they get to choose the color… Some people want white. Some people want dark red. Some people want bright red,” she said, I would never let anyone ask for a green or a blue or something.”

But she said some requests get a little too weird.

“I tend to just ignore it and move on,” she said.

	When the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned, “Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,” it sounded like the inevitable result of a government shutdown. But the line, plastered atop the department's website, hides a deeper truth: The well didn't dry up naturally. It was drained on purpose.


	On November 1, millions of families who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were set to lose their food benefits, leaving parents who plan meals down to the dollar to stare at empty grocery carts.. A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration from suspending food aid, noting the “terror” it has caused families, who will continue to live in fear of losing their benefits under President Donald Trump's administration.


	The cruelty feels sudden, but it's anything but accidental.


	This moment was built, brick by brick, into Republican policy. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill, passed earlier this year, was hailed by Republicans as a model of fiscal responsibility. In reality, it was a Trojan horse packed with provisions designed to quietly sabotage SNAP, one of the most effective anti-poverty programs in the nation.

	











	For decades, the USDA has adjusted the Thrifty Food Plan — the formula that determines SNAP benefit levels — to reflect what it actually costs to eat. In 2021, after years of stagnation, the USDA finally modernized the plan, raising benefits by $1.40 per person per day. That small increase helped families keep up with rising grocery costs and better align benefits with real nutrition needs.

	











	Trump and the GOP's new law stopped that progress cold. It restricts USDA updates to once every five years and demands that any future change be cost-neutral. Translation: no more benefit increases, even if food prices skyrocket. As inflation drives grocery bills higher, SNAP recipients will see their purchasing power erode year after year. The result is institutionalized hunger.

					100 Best Movies of the 21st Century		
	









	The law's cruelty doesn't end with benefit cuts. Beginning in 2027, the federal government will slash its share of SNAP's administrative costs from 50 percent to 25 percent, forcing states to cover the rest. Ten states, including California, New York, and North Carolina, rely on county governments to manage SNAP. Those counties serve 14.6 million people, or roughly one-third of all participants. In Alabama, nearly one in seven residents rely on the SNAP program to help them meet their basic needs.


	That shift will devastate local budgets. States and counties will be forced to either raise taxes, cut services, or both. SNAP offices will be overwhelmed, leading to longer processing times and fewer resources to help families navigate the system. People won't just lose benefits because of budget cuts; they'll lose them because the bureaucracy collapses under its own weight.


	And for immigrant families, the pain will be even more acute. The Big Beautiful Bill sharply restricts SNAP eligibility for immigrants — a move that doesn't save much money but sends a clear political message: Hunger is acceptable if it happens to the right people.


	When the USDA says “the well has run dry,” it's not just an accounting statement. It's a moral one. Republicans have spent years dismantling the mechanisms that keep Americans fed and now, when the system predictably fails, they shrug and call it unfortunate.


	The shutdown isn't the cause of the SNAP crisis; it's just the spark that revealed the dry kindling underneath. The Big Beautiful Bill laid the groundwork. It weakened the safety net, shifted costs to states, and guaranteed that when Washington stopped functioning, hunger would spread fastest among those who could least afford it.

	SNAP has never been a luxury. It's a promise that in the richest nation on earth, no one should go hungry. It's one of the few government programs that works exactly as intended: simple, efficient, and life-saving. But it only works when lawmakers let it.


	Trump and Republicans call their bill “beautiful.” There's nothing beautiful about forcing parents to choose between feeding their kids and paying rent. There's nothing fiscally responsible about starving the system until it collapses. The Trump administration is telling the nation that for millions of families about to go hungry, the well has run dry. But for ballrooms, billionaires, and the corporations they control, there is an endless spigot of special tax breaks and loopholes that keeps their wealth skyrocketing.

MLB instituted a rule that if a starting pitcher was in the batting lineup, he could continue hitting despite being taken off the mound — a rule that allows Ohtani to stay in the game upon being removed as a starter.

However, if Ohtani started the game as the team's designated hitter and later entered in relief, they would risk losing his powerful bat in the lineup upon his exit as a pitcher. 

The only way Ohtani could remain in the game after being used as a relief pitcher would be to play the field, something he has not done often in his career. The three-time MVP has played the field just 8 1/3 innings in his career and has not done so since 2021.

With all of that in mind, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts will start Ohtani on the mound, ensuring they can keep his bat in the game regardless of how long he pitches. It is not clear how deep Ohtani will pitch into the game, as he is on three days' rest.

Many Americans may soon lose crucial federal assistance, leaving some lawmakers asking whether it's time for Donald Trump to begin negotiating with Democrats.

Many Americans may soon lose crucial federal assistance, leaving some lawmakers asking whether it's time for Donald Trump to begin negotiating with Democrats. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined last night to discuss the mounting pressure to reopen the government, and when—or if—the president will get directly involved.

Trump tends to become “involved when there's a need for him,” Seung Min Kim, a White House reporter at the Associated Press said last night. “That need is going to come when Republican leaders tell him, ‘Okay, you need to come and do something about this.'” Still, Kim continued, messaging from Republicans has been fairly consistent: To end the shutdown, Democrats will have to vote for the existing funding bill. “That calculus—that line from Republicans down—hasn't changed as of this point,” she added.

Joining the guest moderator and Atlantic staff writer Vivian Salama to discuss this and more: Paul Beckett, a senior editor at The Atlantic; Jeff Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters; Kim, the Associated Press White House reporter; and Andrea Mitchell, the chief Washington and foreign affairs correspondent at NBC News.

On Thursday, at the end of Coinbase's third quarter earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that he was “a little bit distracted,” because he'd been “tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call.”

“And I just want to add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Staking, and Web3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call,” Armstrong added.

Why blurt those out without any apparent context? As Armstrong hinted, they were words that users on “mention markets” on Kalshi and Polymarket had wagered would be spoken on the call. So by speaking the words, Armstrong was allowing some of those bets to pay off.

Bloomberg reports that while mention markets remain a relatively niche part of prediction markets, a total of $84,000 had been bet on whether certain words would be spoken on the cryptocurrency company's call. And while Armstrong may have helped some Kalshi and Polymarket users make a little money, he was also illustrating how easily these markets can be manipulated when executives become aware of them.

In fact, Jeff Dorman, CIO at digital assets investment firm Arca, wrote on X that “you need your head examined if you think it's cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market.”

“It's not fun working tirelessly for 8 years trying to educate institutional investors on the value of crypto investing as an investable asset class, and working to help them gain comfort in this industry, while one of the supposed ‘leaders' openly mocks the industry with crap like this,” Dorman said.

Polymarket, meanwhile, posted that Armstrong's comments were “diabolical work.”

Coinbase is moving into supporting prediction markets itself through its Everything Exchange, which Armstrong touted on the earnings call, and the company has also invested in Kalshi and Polymarket. A Coinbase spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company prohibits employees from participating in prediction markets or related activity around the company.

After Armstrong's remarks began drawing attention, he wrote on X, “lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat.”

As tech companies tout their plans for massive new data centers, consumers are increasingly worried the AI-driven gold rush will ultimately drive up the price they pay for electricity, according to a new survey.

The report, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that 80% of consumers are worried about the impact of data centers on their utility bills.

Consumers' concerns aren't unfounded.

Electricity demand in the United States held steady for over a decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Over the last five years, commercial users including data centers and industrial users began drinking more deeply from the grid, with annual growth rising 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, residential use only grew by 0.7% annually.

Data centers today consume about 4% of the electricity generated in the United States, more than double their share in 2018. By 2028, consumption is forecasted to rise to 6.7% to 12%, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Generation has managed to meet demand thanks to a surge in new capacity from solar, wind, and grid-scale battery storage. Big tech companies have been inking large deals for new utility-scale solar, in particular, attracted by the energy source's low cost, modularity, and speed to power. Solar farms can start delivering power to data centers before they're completed, and a new project typically takes around 18 months to complete. 

The EIA expects renewables to dominate new generating capacity through at least the next year. The trend likely would have extended beyond 2026, but experts predict a Republican repeal of key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will hamper the renewables' growth.

Meanwhile, natural gas, another source of energy favored by data center operators, hasn't met the moment. Production has been rising, but most of the new supplies have gone toward feeding exports rather than the domestic market. Consumption by electricity generators rose by 20% between 2019 and 2024, while exporters consumed 140% more.

New natural gas power plants won't be ready in time, either, since they take around four years to complete, according to the International Energy Agency. A backlog of turbines used by gas-fired power plants has only compounded the problem. Manufacturers are quoting delivery dates up to seven years out, and newly announced production capacity is unlikely to change things.

Slow natural gas buildouts coupled with kneecapped renewables have put data center developers in a bind.

While AI and data centers aren't entirely responsible for increasing electricity demand — industrial users have been nearly as thirsty — they've been leading the headlines. 

AI is likely to be the focus of consumers' ire: More people are concerned about the technology than excited about it, according to a Pew survey. No surprise given that many employers have been wielding the tool as a way to cut headcount rather than improve augment employee productivity.

Throw rising energy prices into the mix, and you can begin to see how a backlash might be brewing.

Generating nuclear power takes a lot of energy—extreme heat, pressure, and radiation—that every part of a reactor must withstand each time. Naturally, engineering the perfect apparatus is a difficult task, but researchers continue to discover astonishing ways to advance nuclear technology, the latest of which involves a tiny chip with not-so-tiny performance.

In a recent release, University of Maine researchers announced new microelectronic sensors that tolerate both the radiation levels and extreme temperatures of a nuclear reactor's core. At the same time, the sensor captures real-time operational data, giving engineers and operators invaluable insight into the reactor's activity.

“Since many advanced reactors currently under development operate at these temperatures, there is a high demand on the sensors to monitor them,” Mauricio Pereira da Cunha, the project's principal investigator, said in the release. “The successful development of these sensors will address and alleviate technology barriers that currently hinder the rollout of advanced nuclear reactors.”

The sensor is intended to live inside the furnace of reactors for nuclear fission, which generates large loads of energy by splitting two heavy molecules. Specifically, the researchers hope to install the sensors in advanced high-temperature reactors, which run on helium gas and contain ceramic materials to more efficiently and safely generate nuclear energy.

However, these reactors reach higher temperatures than what existing sensors can withstand, as their advantages come with the “higher thermal efficiencies that are attained at higher temperatures,” the researchers explained.

The team, on the other hand, had two decades of expertise in refining similar sensors. This motivated them to spend the last two years developing and testing a sensor strong enough for the next-generation reactors—and, while they were at it, make the sensor tiny to widen its range of applications.

For the project, the team created seven sensors, all tested at the Nuclear Reactor Laboratory at the Ohio State University, according to a report by the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy. Each sensor was 100 nanometers thick—roughly 1,000 times thinner than a strand of hair—and carried platinum-based alloy electrodes packed with alumina caps.

Impressively, all seven sensors “remained functional” and “showed no signs of degradation” despite five days of the reactor blasting them at its maximum power, at about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius), the report explained. Early analyses also implied that the sensors were resilient against radiation, too.

“In addition to extreme temperatures, we're now also exposing these sensors to intense, in-core levels of nuclear radiation at the same time,” Luke Doucette, the project's senior research scientist, said in the release. “This adds an entirely new dimension of difficulty in terms of what types of sensor materials can survive in these conditions and remain functional.”

Jannik Sinner advanced to his maiden final at the Rolex Paris Masters on Saturday after he surged past a physically hampered Alexander Zverev 6-0, 6-1.

The second-seeded Italian was ruthless from start to finish, hitting 23 winners to just 12 unforced errors as he improved to 5-4 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev, who won the title in Paris last year. Zverev saved two match points to overcome Daniil Medvedev on Friday night, but he struggled with his movement and looked out of breath at various points during his semi-final clash with Sinner.

In top form from start to finish! 👏@janniksin knocks out Zverev 6-0 6-1 to reach his first final in Paris!@RolexPMasters | #RolexParisMasters pic.twitter.com/kw9qiJEu1p

“When you drop the physicality like he did, you cannot find the full power on serve,” said Sinner, who won 13 of 16 second-serve return points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “I'm happy to be in the final, but it's not how you want to arrive. Playing against Sascha is always a special occasion, and today he was clearly not 100 per cent, we saw that.

“He was struggling physically. He won an incredible match yesterday, two match points down… Making the final in Vienna, coming here and making the semis again, it's an incredible run, but we all hope that he gets better and fit for Turin.”

By extending his winning streak on indoor hard courts to 25 matches, Sinner set a championship-match meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime. The 24-year-old Italian is into his ninth ATP Masters 1000 final, and third of the season after falling short to Carlos Alcaraz in Rome and Cincinnati.

Sinner is now just 100 points behind Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and would reclaim the World No. 1 spot if he wins the title on Sunday. He is level with Auger-Aliassime at 2-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having won their two latest meetings in Cincinnati and the US Open this year.

“He plays incredible tennis at the moment, he has improved a lot,” Sinner said of Auger-Aliassime. “Especially in the past months, he has found his game again. I'm looking forward to it tomorrow, it's a great occasion for both of us. I'm very happy for Felix, he is one of the nicest guys we have on Tour. It's going to be a very difficult match.”

Sinner has reached the final in nine of the 11 tournaments in which he has competed in this year, including victories at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. It marks the second consecutive year he has reached nine finals, and he has now tied Alcaraz for the most Top-10 wins in 2025 (13).

The ‘Sex and the City' star was at the Tribeca Festival Lisboa on Saturday to talk about her journey as an actor. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Kim Cattrall famously turned down Sex and the City four times, before finally getting on board to play Samantha Jones.


	But Cattrall on Saturday recalled her first acting audition after leaving theater school at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City had her feeling dread and terror. “To go out to the real world, where people could say no, was terrifying to me,” she said while discussing her journey as an actor at Tribeca Festival Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal.




	Well before Cattrall played Jones on Sex and the City, the HBO sitcom that ran from 1998 to 2004, she auditioned for early roles that were mostly victimized women characters. That contrasted with her earlier experience in live theater where more powerful women characters were more available.

	“I was so disappointed that they were asking so little of me, other than to cry or to be hurt or emotionally unstable or drunk,” she remembered about auditions for early movie or TV roles. Still the British-Canadian-American actress learned to do her best in auditions and that if she didn't get the role, it might not have been meant for her to play, “which was a positive thing for a young actor to do,” Cattrall added.


	Now, with time and experience, the Sex in the City star said she has grown to love and embrace acting. “I love my job. I love it. It's difficult, it's complicated, but when it goes well, it's so satisfying,” Cattrall insisted.


	“You have a dream of doing this profession and working with people who have the highest point in their evolution, and to be part of that, it's better than any drug or any sexual climactic experience,” she added. Acting success has also brought Cattrall the luxury of no longer fearing being judged, except by herself.

	











	“It's your work, but people's opinions of me are none of my business. I don't want to know,” she told the Tribeca Festival Lisboa event. That's comes as Cattrall acutely feels her early years as a young actor are far behind her.


	“I don't know how many years I have left. I want to have fun. I want to remain curious, of course,” she said. “It's a great joy to hear people laugh. It's something that you created or made and because what's going on in the world is terrifying and democracy is fragile, and we need each other, and what better way to bring us together than through enjoyment.” 


	Tribeca Festival Lisboa wraps on Saturday.

The Blue Man Group, K-pop stars Le Sarrafim, pop band The Plain White T's, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist Malala Yousafzai don't have a lot in common. But on TikTok, an indie musician's desperate attempt to promote her new song has made them all declare themselves to be part of the same group, and sparked the app's biggest inside joke of the season — and a viral reminder of the battle independent artists face when trying to make their voices heard. And it all started with one simple pronouncement: “If you are watching this video you are in Group 7.”


	For the past 10 years, Australian singer-songwriter Sophia James has spent her time in the Los Angeles  music scene performing her blend of soft-rock and power pop to ever-changing audiences, in the hope of finding success. This included a stint on the 2020 season of American Idol, where James ended in the Top 10 (under her given name Sophia Wackerman), and tours with artists like Jensen McRae and actor and musician Ben Barnes. That exposure that netted her roughly 25 million streams and once, earlier this year, a quick snapshot of her song “Clockwork” on Grey's Anatomy. These are all career milestones, but for an independent artist like James, producing and releasing music without the backing or support of a label can feel like a never ending battle. It was this frustrating push and pull that birthed her new song, “So Unfair.” 

	











	“It's become apparently clear to me within the past few years that to effectively make it, you either have to have copious amounts of money or dumb, dumb luck,” James tells Rolling Stone. “And I was in a place where I was feeling like I could not afford to wait on the luck anymore. So this song was just a hodgepodge of all of those feelings of frustration and powerlessness. It was about my desire to be in [the music industry] and the feeling like I couldn't quite hack it.” 

	










Group 7 who are you 


	James wrote “So Unfair” alongside producer Alex Bilowitz, one of the first tracks in an album she plans to release next spring. But while creating the song might have enabled James to explore her feelings of exasperation and stagnation, what came next was something she dreaded: promoting her work. Even for artists signed to major labels, using social media to promote upcoming releases can feel like a necessary evil — one that leaves many either at the mercy of the algorithm or feeling like they've put down their instruments in favor of advertisement. In the past three years, dozens of indie and mainstream artists alike have said that musicians are receiving intense pressure from labels and executives to manufacture or create viral moments to go along with their work.

	“That's the great double edged sword,” she says. “To make a living off of music you cannot exist in your own creative vacuum. I'm an artist because I didn't want to succumb to the corporate hustle, but it's impossible to make a living off of music without promoting it in some capacity.” 


	So James took to TikTok, posting video after video promoting her fellow artists, upcoming shows, and of course, her song. But somewhere in the middle of a night of furious posting, she fully ran out of ideas. So instead of creating new concepts, she simply numbered her videos, each with her song playing softly in the background. “I have posted seven videos tonight and this is the seventh one — just as a little science experiment to see which video gets the most reach,” James says in the final clip. “And I don't know what that says about you. But you're in Group 7. Welcome!” When she went to bed, James thought she would be lucky if one of the videos reached 100,000 views. But in the morning, a few text messages from people she rarely heard from clued her in that there was something else going on.

	Seemingly overnight, Group 7 went viral. People treated it like a secret club, posting roll calls in James' other videos, taking attendance on for-you-pages, and declaring Group 7 as the place to be. Part of the draw was the mystique; almost all of the Group 7 videos don't mention James at all, offering a tantalizing knowledge gap for people who stumbled onto the phrase while scrolling. There was a Group 7 playlist for Netflix users, a Group 7 dance, even a shoutout to Group 7 from guitar player Kevin Jonas during the Jonas Brothers' recent Florida concert. “Am I Group 7? Yeah,” creator Tefi Pessoa joked. “Do I know what it means? No.” In less than 72 hours, Group 7 was a cheeky if-you-know-you-know trend, one that thrived on posting purposefully with as little context as possible. (It also helps that a song about feeling unlucky is incredibly safe for work — making it the perfect social media trend for brands, colleges, the random celebrity, and even the Empire State Building to participate in without fear.) Since then, James' video has soared past 80 million views, there are close to 800,000 videos using the Group 7 hashtag, and the singer-songwriter is well past half a million followers on TikTok alone. 

	











	As an independent artist, going viral can be the career equivalent of winning the lottery — especially considering how much capturing the attention of TikTok's algorithm can feel like a constant losing battle. It's especially ironic given that James' viral moment centers entirely around a song that's all about feeling frustrated by the music industry and its luck complex. But even with the success of Group 7, James doesn't feel like she's figured anything out. If anything she's more baffled about the process than ever. 


	“What's weird is this whole trend and promotion only really caught fire when I decided to detach from it all. I approached it with this attitude of ‘Nobody's going to see this anyway, so I might as well just post something dumb and meaningless.' And again, I am not the only indie artist out here doing things like this,” James tells Rolling Stone. “There is a whole community of us who are trying, day in and day out, to promote our music. I don't know if it's being purposefully repressed by the algorithm, or if it just doesn't favor independent artists, or if there's no money behind it. So the mystery of it is frustrating, because no one can quite work hard enough or smart enough to crack it.”

	With a viral moment — and zero idea how she got it — James knows that she's in a pretty good spot: more followers, more streams, and a bigger platform to launch her new album next spring. But her, the biggest joy of this entire experience has been watching other independent artists successfully use the Group 7 trend to promote their own work. As the child of two touring musicians, a lover of Laurel Canyon-era rock, a UCLA jazz student, and a young woman determined to develop the best version of her sound, it's always been about the music for James. Everything else is just noise. 


	“This whole thing feels very much like a win for the indie artist, because it's so hard to cut through the noise these days, and none of us have big machines behind us. But we're here on the apps and outside touring, working very hard,” James says. “I am not expecting anything I do after this to have the same reach as this Group 7 phenomenon, because it truly was a lightning-in-a-bottle moment. Whether it's Billboard-charting viral songs or tracks that nobody is listening to, I will be making music either way for the rest of my life. That's the plan.”
