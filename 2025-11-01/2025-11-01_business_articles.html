                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, in October, citing national security concerns. The move prompted Beijing to block Nexperia products from leaving China. The dispute is threatening vehicle production worldwide as automakers warn of looming shortages of the chipmaker's components, which are critical to basic electrical functions in cars and challenging to replace on short notice. The battle has unfolded amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese-linked tech firms from Western governments, including the U.S., which recently tightened export-control rules to limit technology transfers to Chinese-owned entities. Nexperia's owner, Wingtech, was put on a U.S. blacklist in December 2024 for its alleged role "in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability." Here's what to know about where the dispute stands, and why it matters. The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year. In late October, automakers, such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz, sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia's chip exports are curtailed for long. While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight. In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property to another company it owned. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO, Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement. Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies. But signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge. On Friday, reports said the U.S. plans to announce that Nexperia will resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, citing sources familiar with the matter. And on Saturday, China said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban. Chinese officials did not specify what those exemptions could entail. If finalized, the exemptions could ease immediate pressure on automakers. But the broader dispute over ownership, technology control and security oversight remains unresolved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food trucks have boomed in visibility and influence, but the road to success is getting rougher. But once seen as a scrappy alternative to brick-and-mortar restaurants, today's mobile kitchens are navigating many of the same financial pressures that traditional restaurants are facing. More cities are embracing food trucks due to a variety of factors, including consumers' increasing demands for innovative, affordable dining options, back-to-office mandates, and bureaucratic easing of regulations. However, inflation and tariffs mean operators are experiencing rising costs, from transportation to ingredients, often risking the push of menu prices to a breaking point for consumers. For trucks, it is not just imported food staples, but new tariffs on imported aluminum and steel in the trucks and equipment. Fast food and casual restaurants have seen menu prices increasing in the 5% range. Items that were once under $10 are now an average of $11.56, according to a recent Lending Tree report, and food consumers are pushing back. Chipotle recently reported weak results that sank its stock and can at least partially be attributed to consumer perceptions about rising menu prices across-the-board that have hurt sales, its executives said on an earnings call this week. "It's been affecting us a lot," said Angel Ruiz, general manager of Birria-Landia, a New York City-based food truck that launched in 2019 with multiple locations across the city's boroughs. "Prices are going up around 30% for some ingredients," he said. "We try to balance those costs so it doesn't impact the customer's pocket," he added. Some experts say the idea that food trucks are by their nature cheaper was always a false one. "The mainstream food truck, with branding, apps, and culinary innovation are always $10 and up," said Sandipan Sen, professor of marketing at Southeast Missouri State University. "The commercial food trucks were never meant to just be cheap," he said. Cities are becoming more friendly toward food trucks as an established part of the local culture, and more events are being designed with food trucks in mind. But despite relatively low startup costs compared to restaurants, running a food truck comes with major logistical hurdles. "A lot of people think it is easy," Ruiz said. "But the truck itself can cost around $160,000 to $170,000, plus permits and insurance." Along with purchasing the truck, managing one can drain operators' wallets before they ever open to sell their first meal. In fact, "the biggest misconception people have is that a food truck is a cheap restaurant on wheels,'" said Ben Goldberg, co-founder and president of the New York Food Truck Association. "You're talking about managing a mobile restaurant: purchasing the truck, outfitting the truck with kitchen equipment, obtaining all kinds of insurance, and health department permits," Goldberg said. "Between health department requirements, commissary regulations, parking restrictions, fire suppression standards, and individual event permits, the process can feel overwhelming," Goldberg said. "On top of this, there are parking challenges, staffing complexities, and many other pitfalls, all while competing in some of the busiest and most regulated cities in the country." Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not," Ruiz said, explaining that the only way to ensure you get your spot is to park your car there throughout the day. "They need to have a back up plan for everything," said Sen. "If the main chef falls ill, who runs the show that day? They need to have collaborations with complementary business, especially during winter months," Sen said. He added that the use of technology and social media in particular is key to finding a way to operate in winter "when there may not be a lot of crowd waiting to be served." Quality, creativity, and access are now more important to consumers, and "even though prices have increased slightly in recent years (due to inflation, tariffs, etc. ), a food truck lunch is still less expensive than the average quick service or sit down meal in New York City," he said. Think about design, customer experience, and storytelling from day one. And the extension of that brand into events is becoming more critical for sales success. "Many of our most successful members generate the majority of their revenue through private events, brand activations, and catering, not street vending," Goldberg said. The traditional restaurant and truck models are also converging in some cases, Birria-Landia among them. It's planning to open its first brick-and-mortar location in Flushing, Queens, in the Tangram Mall, which is home to retail, dining, and entertainment. That should not be a surprise, according to Sen: "Most [food truck] ventures that have survived for more than five years either have a brick-and-mortar presence or were originally a brick-and-mortar restaurant and the food truck is an offshoot," he said. "Food trucks are not a long term business," he said. "Don't be surprised if your favorite food truck goes out of business, or decides to be brick-and-mortar, or becomes a catering service." What are called fusion trucks are also trending, such as Roy Choi's Kogi BBQ, and New York's Korilla BBQ, blending Asian and Mexican cuisines. Goldberg says food trucks often lead the way with new cuisines. So while affordability and convenience remain core, the experience: discovering something new, eating outdoors, connecting with the chef directly is what makes food trucks so special today," he said. You just have to be passionate and careful," said Ruiz, who has been in the restaurant industry for two decades. "Success starts with understanding your concept's economics, local demand, and operational logistics," Goldberg said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The ship's fastest speed was a record-setting 35.2 knots, or a little over 40 miles per hour, in 1968. At 887 feet and 7 inches long, the USS New Jersey is almost three football fields long, and 5 feet longer than the Titanic. The USS New Jersey earned 19 battle stars throughout its career. After it was decommissioned for the last time, it was transformed into a museum based in its namesake state where visitors can explore spaces such as the combat engagement center, officers' staterooms, and gun turrets. "I've been here eight years now," Ryan Szimanski, curator of Battleship New Jersey, told Business Insider. "I still have not been in all 1,600 rooms." Take a look inside the USS New Jersey. The 45,000-ton ship cost around $150 million to build in the 1940s, or around $2 billion in 2025 when adjusted for inflation. Reagan was the first sitting president to commission a battleship. After serving in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, it was decommissioned for the final time in 1991. The museum, operated by Battleship New Jersey, offers daily self-guided and guided tours. Tickets can be purchased through Battleship New Jersey. The USS New Jersey's shore bombardment capabilities made it irreplaceable from World War II through the 1980s. "Even though aircraft carriers rendered battleships obsolete nominally in World War II, in the '50s, they bring the ship back. Because to this day, we haven't developed a platform that can cheaply provide that shore bombardment," Szimanski said. The explosive rounds weighed 1,900 pounds and armor-piercing rounds weighed 2,700 pounds — about the same as a Kia Soul. The 16-inch guns could hit targets up to 23 miles away. "Pull the trigger on that," Szimanski said, pointing to a M2 Browning machine gun on the deck. Far be it from me to disobey a direct order. This particular gun was a replica, but visitors to the USS New Jersey can fire blanks from its 5-inch or 40mm saluting guns upon making a donation to the museum. The red line focuses on weapons and navigation, with stops like the combat engagement center and missile deck. Szimanski guided me through a combination of these routes for a broader look at the ship, but if you do all four as they're laid out, it's 1 ½ miles long and covers 200 of the ship's 1,600 rooms. The USS New Jersey was designed to hold 2,000 crew members, but during War War II, there were 2,700 sailors on board. When there weren't enough bunks, sailors slept in hammocks. Around 3,000 former crew members have visited the museum since it opened in 2001, Szimanski said. Officers were seated by rank and only began eating once the executive officer, or XO, gave the signal. Unlike enlisted crew members, officers paid for all of their meals. Reason told the museum that he read classified information at a desk in his bedroom, but otherwise spent most of his time working at a larger desk in the stateroom. The spacious room was meant to impress foreign leaders … and intimidate them. "It's very specifically placed right here so that when dignitaries come across the gangway, they have to walk past the gun turrets to get here," Szimanski said. It featured more modern equipment such as the Tomahawk Weapons System for launching Tomahawk missiles, and sensors including Air Search and Surface Search radars. Volunteers worked to make the CEC as realistic as possible with screens showing mock-ups of how the computers functioned. Much of this equipment is still used on modern Navy ships. Upon closer examination, the museum realized the keys had brass tags that read "nuclear PTF," which stands for "permission to fire." "The Navy just left the original keys on board, the museum had them, and we didn't know we had them for over 20 years," Szimanski said. A ladder leads from the admiral's state room up to the admiral's bridge for easy access. Only four officers have ever been promoted to five-star fleet admiral in the history of the Navy. Since Halsey held the title, no other officer has been promoted to that level. If the conning tower was damaged or destroyed during battle, there were three other places on board where the ship could be steered from. "That's the real genius of this ship, the level of redundancy that they built in," Szimanski said. "Okay, you might be able to shoot through this and knock that out, but we've got four backups or six backups. We've found one system so far that has at least 46 different backups." The USS New Jersey measures 11 stories high. The museum offers special 90-minute in-depth tours of Turret II, spanning five stories. "My favorite thing about the computer is in the 1980s, they looked at replacing it with a modern digital computer and they chose not to," Szimanski said. "The modern computer was as accurate, but it wasn't more accurate, so why waste the money? Plus, if we lose power because we've been hit by the enemy, the modern computer dies. A screen also showed video footage of the guns firing, making it feel even more realistic. The hallway featured equipment such as oxygen breathing apparatuses and doors leading to fire rooms and engine rooms. If a torpedo from an enemy ship penetrated the ship's multiple layers of steel — three layers on the bottom and five on the sides — crew members in the fire room could make a quick escape via this four-story ladder. "We are not allowed to run our radar, because if we did, all of the cable TV within 50 miles would go out," Szimanski said. Enlisted crew members were served in buffet-style lines on metal trays, unlike officers who ate on china and silver. Enlisted crew members could choose between the meal of the day, which would have been entrees like ginger pot roast or steak and lobster, or fast-food-style items such as pizza, hot dogs, and cheeseburgers, which were always available. They had around 12 minutes to eat their meals. Since the crew was so large, they ate in at least three shifts. The USS New Jersey usually had two chaplains on board — one Protestant and one Catholic — but the chapel was a non-denominational space that held worship services for other faiths, as well. Male crew members' hair was not allowed to be any longer than 3 inches. The ship's washing machines could wash 100 pounds of uniforms per load, and the dryers held 50 pounds each. In the brig, prisoners received one ration of bread and water per day and had to be escorted to the bathroom by a Marine. The USS New Jersey carried different aircraft throughout its years of service. During World War II, it deployed Kingfisher and Seahawk seaplanes to monitor the aim of the 16-inch guns. Helicopters replaced seaplanes in the Korean War, when a Sikorsky HO3S-1 Dragonfly helicopter known as the "Jersey Bounce" assisted with search-and-rescue missions. Why did the Navy phase out battleships? Szimanski said the answer was simple: Battleships have large-caliber guns and thick armor, but neither can withstand missiles. However, President Donald Trump has expressed interest in bringing battleships back. At the September all-hands meeting called by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth featuring 800 military leaders, Trump said that he'd spoken to Navy Secretary John Phelan and that it's "something we're seriously considering." "Some people would say, 'No, that's old technology.' I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns," Trump said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Destroyers are equipped with high-range guns and missiles. Long-range strikes are carried out by aircraft carriers. And submarines have filled the role of anti-surface warships. However, there's no vessel that can execute shore bombardment as effectively and efficiently as battleships did with their large artillery. That's why the USS New Jersey was brought out of retirement again and again after World War II — and why it would still serve as a crucial asset if the need arose. "If we got into another first-class shooting war, there's a strong chance that they would fire me and bring the ship back," Szimanski said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a wave of big companies announcing steep job cuts, many laid-off workers may face a financially difficult and uncertain period ahead. Amazon said on Tuesday that it would eliminate around 14,000 corporate positions, and the United Parcel Service, or UPS, said it had reduced its operational workforce by 34,000 jobs this year. On Wednesday, General Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers, and Paramount terminated 1,000 people. "Now is a particularly challenging time to be unemployed," said Michele Evermore, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. Some companies have said they are trimming their headcounts as they redirect resources to artificial intelligence or respond to President Donald Trump's whipsawing tariff policies and his administration's other priorities. Following a job loss, often people need to figure out how to supplement their income, find new health insurance and continue paying their bills. CNBC spoke with experts about how unemployed workers can best navigate those steps. Despite the government shutdown, which began on Oct.1, states still have access to their state unemployment trust fund to pay out benefits, said Andrew Stettner, the director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation. "Eventually they will run out of federal funds to pay the staff that process the benefits, but we've not heard of that happening yet," Stettner said. As a result, those who've lost their job should "immediately file" for unemployment insurance, Evermore said. Before you do so, you'll want to gather the following information: your pay over the last 18 months, names of previous employers during that period and their addresses, your Social Security number, state-issued identification and any documentation from your last company. On a DOL-sponsored website, you can find the contact information for state unemployment agencies. State agencies should pay benefits within three weeks of your application, but delays have become more common since the pandemic, Evermore said. "It's probably going to get worse as layoffs increase," she added. In most states, claimants can get benefits for 26 weeks, she added — although the benefits last for just 12 weeks in some states, such as Florida. Your first step is to find out when your workplace insurance officially expires, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corporation. Some companies provide additional months of coverage under their plan after a layoff. Once your coverage lapses, you may be offered the chance to continue it under COBRA, shorthand for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, said Caitlin Donovan, a spokeswoman for the Patient Advocate Foundation. Other options for getting new health insurance include enrolling in a spouse's plan or seeking subsidized coverage on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or through Medicaid, Eibner said. Those who've lost their employer health benefits typically have 60 days to sign up for an ACA Marketplace plan, Eibner added. At the heart of the current stalemate in Washington is whether or not to extend Covid-era enhanced tax credits for ACA marketplace enrollees. Without that aid being extended, many people will see higher prices for marketplace coverage in 2026. "However, the tax credits aren't going away completely," Eibner said. Medicaid is the cheapest health-care option and may actually cost you close to nothing, experts said. Eligibility is based in part on your current income, which may allow many newly unemployed workers to qualify — although jobless benefits may have an impact. An exception: If you have less than $5,000 in your workplace retirement account, your employer may require that you move the funds. You may also be able to transfer your funds without taxation or penalties to another qualified retirement plan, including a 401(k) at your next company if that's allowed, or to an individual retirement account, Levit said. If your former employer isn't forcing a transfer, there's no need to rush into this decision. While cashing out your 401(k) is another option, it's not a desirable one, Levit said: "The distribution is taxable as ordinary income," and "depending on the employee's age, there could also be penalties for an 'early withdrawal.'" "401(k) loans are typically due in full at termination," she said. "If they are not repaid, the outstanding loan will be considered a taxable distribution subject to ordinary income taxes and potentially penalties." But it's worth talking to your plan administrator and learning what your options are, Levit added: "Some have flexibility about continuing payments even after termination." People who've lost a job and are worried about their student loan bill have options, too. You can enroll in an income-driven repayment plan that sets your monthly payment based on your earnings and submit proof that you've lost your job; while unemployment benefits will count as income, you're likely to get a low payment and some may not owe anything under their plan's terms. The U.S. Department of Education also offers an Unemployment Deferment, in which you can possibly pause your payments for up to three years after a job loss. "Lenders are often willing to work with you, especially if it's something temporary like a government shutdown, job loss or natural disaster." If you can manage it, making at least the minimum payments on all of your debts will avoid the start of any collection activity and possible risks to your credit, Rossman added. On top of taking care of your finances, it's also important to tend to your mental health after a job loss, Evermore said. That might mean sharing what you're going through with others, including family, friends and a therapist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp rebound in operating profit on Saturday, while its cash pile swelled to a new high with no buybacks. Berkshire's operating profit generated from the conglomerate's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads jumped 34% year over year to $13.485 billion in the third quarter. The gains were driven by a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which rose to $2.37 billion. Buffett once again refrained from repurchasing shares despite a significant pullback in the stock. Class A and B shares of the conglomerate are up 5% each in 2025, while the S&P 500 is up 16.3%. Without any buybacks, Berkshire's cash hoard swelled to a record $381.6 billion, surpassing the previous high of $347.7 billion set in the first quarter of this year. Berkshire also didn't find other stocks attractive, net selling equities in the third quarter for a taxable gain of $10.4 billion. The 95-year-old Buffett in May announced he's stepping down as CEO at the year-end after six legendary decades. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as chief executive, while Buffett will remain chairman of the board. Abel will also start writing annual letters in 2026. Last month, Berkshire announced a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal marks Berkshire's largest since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany. Overall earnings, which include gains from Berkshire's investments in other publicly traded companies, rose 17% to $30.8 billion year on year.

Jensen Huang speaks to the media on the sidelines of the APEC CEO Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, yesterday.

Even for Jensen Huang, it was an extraordinary week.

The Nvidia Corp. chief headlined his company's first developers conference in Washington on Tuesday and finished in South Korea where he tucked into a dinner of fried chicken and beer with the heads of Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Group. In between, he cut numerous deals with companies including Nokia Oyj, Uber Technologies Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business: Advanced Drainage Systems is a manufacturer of stormwater and onsite wastewater solutions. Its infiltrator segment is a provider of plastic leachfield chambers and systems, septic tanks and accessories, primarily for use in residential applications. Its international segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside the United States, with a strategy focused on its owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through its joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Impactive Capital is an active ESG investor that launched with a $250 million investment from CalSTRS and now has approximately $3 billion. In just seven years, they have made quite a name for themselves as AESG investors. Wolfe and Asmar realized that there was an opportunity to use tools, notably on the social and environmental side, to drive returns. Impactive focuses on positive systemic change to help build more competitive, sustainable businesses for the long run. Impactive will use traditional operational, financial and strategic tools that activists use, but will also implement ESG change that they believe is material to the business and drives profitability of the company and shareholder value. Impactive looks for high quality businesses that are usually complex and mispriced, where they can underwrite a minimum of a high teens or low 20% internal rate of return over a three- to five-year holding period, and have active engagement with management to set up multiple ways to win. On Oct. 21, Impactive said they had taken a position in Advanced Drainage Systems. Advanced Drainage Systems is the market share leader in plastic stormwater and onsite septic wastewater management solutions. The company is a pioneer in the development and manufacturing of plastic drainage products, primarily utilizing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene. Recycled materials made up 46% of WMS' purchased inputs in fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest recyclers in North America. Between its three segments, the company has a $15 billion addressable market and is the clear industry leader with 75% to 95% market share across its segments. There is a lot to like about WMS, as it is an extremely high-quality and well-run company with a long history of compounding growth and secular tailwinds. As a result, WMS has an impressive track record, having grown earnings per share almost 10x since its initial public offering, and has a 28% EPS compound annual growth rate with returns on invested capital consistently above 20%. Management is also very focused on shareholder value and are great capital allocators, increasing dividends and launching buybacks in most years where it does not see a compelling M&A opportunity. However, Impactive Capital believes that both concerns appear to be overblown or misplaced and that management has built this business to protect its top line from market cyclicality and make margin expansion structural, not cyclical. As to the cyclicality of construction spending, construction spending is down 3% year to date as higher interest rates and affordability concerns have dampened residential and non-residential construction spending, setting this up to be the worst year for construction in the past two decades aside from the global financial crisis. First, plastic pipes have been stealing market share from concrete and steel. Only about 20% of the market in 2010, plastic now exceeds 40% due to it being 20% cheaper than alternatives and offering superior performance. Third, billion-dollar storm events have quintupled since the 1980s, necessitating increased investment in resiliency and more complex stormwater infrastructure. The company also has a wide moat, enabled by its high brand loyalty from contractors, its vertical integration and excellent distribution network. However, this is something else that management has taken a lot of steps and adopted many initiatives to avoid. So, when oil spikes, they use recycled resin, and when it drops, they switch to virgin resin and capture better margins. WMS is the only one of its competitors who can do this at scale. Moreover, when construction is weak, oil and resin prices tend to decline. So, loss to the top line can be made up on the bottom line as the decline in resin prices is more than enough to offset end-market weaknesses (i.e., construction spending is down about 3% YTD, resin prices are down 15% to 20%). As a result, pipe and Allied Products adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded by about 8 percentage points since 2020, but some fear that this will eventually normalize. However, Impactive believes that this shift is structural, not cyclical and WMS will not only avoid margin compression but could see gross margin expand by 100 bps over the next 12-24 months; something that is not factored into forward consensus estimates.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When personal trainer Dani Coleman got an email in 2021 about working with Jennifer Aniston, she assumed it had to be a prank. "It was definitely a 'pinch me' moment," Coleman, the director of training at fitness company Pvolve, told Business Insider. It was, in fact, the Jennifer Aniston: star of "Friends," Primetime Emmy winner, Hollywood actress-turned-producer. Coleman told me that Aniston heard about Pvolve through a friend and had been quietly tuning in to livestreamed workouts during the first year of the pandemic. As in-person fitness made a comeback, Aniston reached out to Pvolve's Los Angeles studio for 1:1 sessions. She said Aniston, 56, is an impressive athlete who consistently works hard in the gym, whether she has an hour or 20 minutes to spare in her busy schedule. "I think you can make amazing progress with two full-body workouts a week," Coleman said. Resistance exercise to build strength and muscle is a cornerstone of Aniston's workouts, Coleman said. Her gym sessions focus on a technique called progressive strength training, which involves gradually increasing the challenge of a workout by adding more weight, sets, or reps — continually pushing the muscles to grow. Coleman said the workouts incorporate dumbbell weights, which help activate more muscle groups than exercise machines, requiring core strength to help control the weight. If Aniston is traveling, those exercises can be adapted, swapping free weights for a resistance band. Regardless of which equipment you choose, research suggests weight training is a good idea to improve longevity — preventing frailty, improving metabolic health, and staving off cancer and heart diseases by making the body more resilient. Progressive overload is key if you want to keep making progress. For best results, track your reps, sets, and weights to ensure you continue to build on your efforts over time without overdoing it. Coleman said she uses plyometric exercises, explosive movements that train the body to use fast-switch muscle fibers, in addition to amping up heart rate. For more joint-friendly options to work around previous injuries (Aniston has had knee surgeries and back problems), Coleman said she includes scaled options, such as a step-up or weighted step-up, instead of a box jump. One of Aniston's strongest attributes in the gym is impressive core strength, Coleman said. Ultimately, core strength is about stabilizing your body so everything works right — from metabolism to staying nimble as you age. "It's all about independence, the quality of life that you're able to keep for longer." Aniston previously said she gave up on the "no pain, no gain" approach to working out and stopped pushing herself through long, grueling cardio sessions. "It's knowing that, OK, I can get a really great workout, but leave feeling energized and I can consistently do this because my body isn't breaking down along the way, but still be challenged," she said.</p>

And yet, after testing it out a little bit, I was surprised to find that, in certain cases, it seems better than Wikipedia. Of course, its entries for hot-button things like "Elon Musk" or "gender" are exactly what you'd expect for its "unbiased" mission. But most pages are not hotbeds of "wokism," so they end up almost word-for-word identical to Wikipedia. xAI did not respond to a request for comment on how Grokipedia pages were chosen. As you can probably imagine, this isn't a particularly political entry. Like most movie entries, Grokipedia's has a plot summary, some production details, a cast list, and an overview of the critical reception. After browsing around Grokipedia for a while, I came across some things that seemed particularly promising. Where the writing lacks cohesion, tiny details are given equal prominence alongside big facts, and the result is generally a mess. The entry isn't short, but it's disorganized, with a lengthy "history" section that reads like a list of disjointed bullet points. Meanwhile, the Grokipedia version felt much more thorough and organized into sections about its history, academics, facilities, admissions, and impact. This is one of those things where there is lots of solid information about it existing out there on the internet — more than has been added so far to the Wikipedia page by real humans — and an AI can crawl the web to find these sources and turn it into text. I will note that there are some unusual aspects to the entry, however. There's a whole section that talks about the arguments for and against single-sex education and a discussion of the school's racial diversity that has more than a whiff of an anti-DEI agenda. My head hurts again, so let's set that aside for now. What I can see is a version where AI is able to flesh out certain types of articles and improve them with additional information from reliable sources. In my poking around, I found a few other cases like this: entries for small towns, which are often sparse on Wikipedia, are filled out more robustly on Grokipedia. One interesting example: By clicking "Random article" on Wikipedia and searching for corresponding Grokipedia entries, I found a curious case where the two entries differ slightly. But Grokipedia's was even longer, and formatted quite differently — and frankly, I thought it told a better narrative of the baroness's untimely demise. For example, Grokipedia used a citation for a Facebook page about royal history that seemed to be viral clickbait written by AI. But it's an interesting idea of how AI could help to improve Wikipedia itself. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikimedia, the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia, recently appeared on NPR's Open to Debate show, where he said that he's not opposed to AI helping out. He gives an example of an editor looking at a page that needs improvement and asking AI to identify additional relevant facts in the sources already on the page. Then the editor could verify those and add them himself. I'm not planning on switching to Grokipedia for factual information anytime soon, and I don't recommend you do, either. In a way, the best outcome would be for Wikipedia to observe what does or doesn't work on Grokipedia as a sort of sandbox, and take lessons from it.</p>

Patricia Willson, 93, stares intently at her leg as her nurse unwraps layers of bandages, revealing a scar that, to Willson's elation, is nowhere near as gruesome as it had been months ago. Hunched over from a fractured back, Willson scrolls through her phone to remind her nurse what the scar had looked like. Last December, she sliced her leg open on a box. A few months later, the three-inch gash got infected. "It scared me so bad when my legs started hurting," Willson tells her nurse, as Business Insider visited her home in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, earlier this year. Nestled between bills and medical records on one side of the desk sits a stapled-together printout of 50 websites for finding freelance work. Tucked away on the other side is a slightly wrinkled cover letter she's been sending to companies. "I really need a job," she says under her breath. There aren't too many people her age looking for work, she acknowledges somberly. Willson, a mother of six, worked in payroll at companies like Pfizer before opening a home rental business in 2006, which she runs with her daughter and her son-in-law. Until four years ago, Willson was on her feet doing chores around the property; she has since become less able to perform physical tasks. She's one of the nearly 1.4 million people over age 65 who have a disability and still work — whether by choice, like some, or by necessity, like Willson, who says that after paying all her bills, she sometimes struggles to have extra money left at the end of the month to buy a full cart of groceries. Business Insider's "80 over 80" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. On a recent group call AARP held about applying for jobs, Willson suspected she was the oldest there by at least a decade. With almost nothing in savings, even with Social Security, she's spent hours each day browsing remote jobs and educating herself on what may be out there, knowing full well that most companies might not consider someone at her age. It's a growing reality that older Americans are increasingly relying on work to make ends meet. Of the more than 175 people 80 and older who spoke to Business Insider about working later in life, most mentioned some health issue as a challenge. Common ones included arthritis, mobility impairments, heart disease, hearing loss, and memory problems. Most of these didn't prevent them from performing their job tasks. Their health issues have led them to either struggle throughout the day or find employment where they can work around periods of pain. For four decades, Patricia Moore, 81, has managed a gas station, earning about $36,000 a year despite suffering from neuropathy and swelling. It's exhausting some days, but she has to work to supplement her $2,800 monthly Social Security income, as she doesn't have sufficient savings. "Retirement is not in the near future, as it costs more every month to just survive," said Moore, who lives in California. Research by Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at The New School in New York, suggests that working later in life benefits those who want to work — and harms those with no choice but to work, especially as mortality risks and stress levels increase. Business Insider's analysis of Census data found that while many of the most common occupations for Americans 80 and older are less risky, meaning lower incidences of injuries or fatalities, thousands work in higher-risk professions, such as truck driving, personal care, janitorial work, and construction. In interviews, some workers in these professions said that while they mostly enjoy the work, they worry that their health could hinder their productivity — or that working could put their lives in danger. In a decade, estimates suggest, there will be more Americans 65 and older than below 18 — a flip of the current distribution of age, and a challenge when it comes to keeping an economy growing. "To offset those pressures on the workforce, people who continue to work into their 80s, beyond conventional retirement ages, help the equation," said Nicole Maestas, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, adding that the US has already seen substantial reductions in GDP growth due to an aging population. With fewer people available to work — and therefore fewer people paying the taxes that fund healthcare benefits — Maestas said companies and policymakers should consider "how we can take advantage of technology to complement work." During the pandemic, companies rushed to partner with health-based advisors and adopt more age-friendly benefits and health-related policies, said Talia Varley, managing director of global corporate advisory at the Cleveland Clinic. David Hugo Barrett, 82, begins every middle and high school class he teaches with life lessons about the importance of working hard and staying out of trouble. For a few hours each day, he feels young, learning Gen Alpha slang and staying in touch with the latest tech trends. He has lymphedema, which leads to swelling in his legs, and peripheral neuropathy, which causes nerve damage in his feet. "People say age is nothing but a number. "Aging is not something that can be taken lightly." His wife, 74, works as a substitute teacher for elementary school students. Staying retired was not an option, he said. "The financial part is not insignificant, and I look forward to getting those checks every two weeks," Barrett said. Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a resident scholar at Brandeis University in Massachusetts who studies aging, said that because people's incomes often peak in their mid-50s, it's much harder to earn an adequate salary in later years — which keeps people employed for longer, even amid severe health challenges. "Ethically speaking, if we had a good healthcare system in the United States that covered everybody from cradle to grave, we would have more healthy people," she said, adding that mid-career ageism can push back people's retirement ages. Additionally, about 26 million Americans under 65 are uninsured, so those who face medical challenges may have to work later to recover medical expenses, she said. Jane Way, 84, wanted to continue a professional career into her retirement years despite mobility limitations. She's been in a wheelchair for five years. She spent her retirement savings early, putting two grandchildren through college. But in 2022, she spiraled after a "perfect storm" of events — heightened competition in the real estate market that tanked her income, her husband's death in a car crash, and the sale of her rental properties at a meager profit. Now, Richter, who lives in north-central Arkansas, accepts whatever notary jobs she can find, often at a lower fee than she'd like. "Being tethered to a cellphone and/or computer isn't freeing, but it works, as there is no way I could cope with a job with set hours," Richter said. Although she considers her health good, the stress of work and some minor health issues make her feel more tired. She takes calcium supplements, struggles to lift heavier objects, and finds that daily tasks take longer than they did two years ago. "It's a tightrope walk with no net," Richter said. "Nor do I know how long the rope is." Jack Rowe, a former Aetna CEO and professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University, said the "forgotten middle," meaning those who earn above the poverty line but not enough to live comfortably, are particularly vulnerable to a dearth of geriatricians, changes to Medicaid policy, and care worker staffing challenges. Despite working for six decades in various roles, Kathy Curtis, 81, has found herself with limited savings and facing health issues. Because she lives in a rural area in Northern California, where seeing people out and about is less likely, the job is "like a social event," she said. Still, she regrets how tired it makes her feel. She gets out of breath easily, though she's grateful her health issues of the past, such as breast cancer and blood clots in her lungs, have gone away. "I've never made a lot of money, but I've also never looked, acted, or felt like a poverty case either, even though a great deal of the time I've stayed just barely above poverty," Curtis said. Some of those who don't technically need to work told Business Insider that it provides something necessary: a purpose. Clark Allan Blasdell, 81, works full-time for a nonprofit community development corporation he founded half a century ago and has no regrets about how he managed his finances. Actually getting to work, though, is much more of a feat than ever. It's been harder to stay on top of his type 1 diabetes since he regularly has to check his blood sugar levels. "I'm just hopeful that I'll be able to keep my ears open, my eyes open, and that they're working, and I'm trying to find somebody who can help me with this," Blasdell said. Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at the financial services company DA Davidson, said that financial advisors have worked increasingly more with clients on addressing long-term care and health planning instead of waiting until health deteriorates. Back in northwest Arkansas, Willson peers out the window, watching her daughter steering a riding lawn mower around her property. A groundhog stares back as she contemplates her future. "Everyone thinks their situation is pretty bad, but I know there are people a lot worse than I am," Willson said. She would like to have a full night's sleep and wake up refreshed. She would like to have a more stable part-time job that gives her purpose. There's only so much optimism someone like Willson can muster when missing a tax bill or credit card payment can have a domino effect. But like many workers in their 80s and 90s, Willson has no desire to give up on decades of effort, even if it means being stubborn. Willson walks cautiously down the steps to her small storage room, filled with boxes of old papers. She flips through the pages, pauses to read her mother's heavy cursive handwriting, then puts it back in the box. It's moments like this, she says, that give her the will to do everything in her power to stay around a little longer.</p>

Imatra town center has changed utterly, with most downtown stores gone, in Finland on Oct. 24, 2025.

In South Karelia, which lies closer to St. Petersburg than Helsinki, shock over Russia's actions is turning to apprehension at what comes next.

As a child during the Cold War, Sari Tukiainen would climb a hill in her hometown of Imatra and look over the border to the smokestacks of Svetogorsk, wondering about the Soviet Union that lay beyond.

Later, she was among the Finns who earned well from their neighbors, as Russian tourists poured over the frontier and filled Imatra's streets, stores, hotels and spas.</p>

Air traffic controller shortages are piling up as the government shutdown drags on, with delays and disruptions being reported at airports nationwide. The Federal Aviation Administration had issued staffing triggers —which signify an air traffic control center is understaffed — for an unusually long list of centers as of Friday evening. At least 11 airports that experienced delays on Friday evening cited staffing as an issue, according to FAA advisories. "JFK, Newark, and LaGuardia are all under FAA traffic restrictions this evening because of high winds and reduced staffing in multiple air traffic control centers," the New York City Emergency Management Department said, adding, "More restrictions are possible if conditions worsen. Travelers should expect widespread ripple delays and check with their airline for the latest flight status." Other airports that experienced staffing-related delays on Friday included Nashville International, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and George Bush Intercontinental in Houston. The FAA and Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>

Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled Friday afternoon that President Donald Trump must fund food stamps during the government shutdown. In a Friday night Truth Social post, Trump signaled he would comply with the judges' orders. "Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do," the president said on Truth Social. Patrick A. Penn, deputy undersecretary for US Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, said in a letter to state leaders on October 24 that the Agriculture Department is "suspending all November 2025 benefit allotments until such time as sufficient federal funding is provided, or until FNS directs State agencies otherwise." Because of previous budget allocations, using federal funds to pay for November benefits would pull money away from other important programs, like school lunches or disaster relief, the Department said. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is America's largest food safety net, helping around 42 million low-income households afford groceries each month. It's not yet been determined if these benefits will be partial or full checks. Any previous unused benefits will also be allowed to roll over this month, Penn said in his October 24 letter. "SNAP is the first best lifeline for folks to access food resources who are having trouble putting together meals on their own," Hall said. SNAP makes a big difference in many families' ability to afford basic groceries. Benefits can be used to buy fruits, vegetables, meat, and grains. Losing SNAP, even for a couple of weeks, can be devastating. Beneficiaries typically work and live near the federal poverty line, which is about $15,000 annually for a single person. About 12% of Americans receive SNAP, though enrollment varies by state. Other nutrition aid programs, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), could see a disruption of November benefits until the government reopens, although benefits for those programs have continued through October. Social Security checks, Medicare, and Medicaid will continue as normal. "We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats," a USDA spokesperson told Business Insider before the rulings. USDA did not immediately respond to comment on the rulings. With Republicans and Democrats at an impasse over healthcare funding, it's unclear when the government will reopen. States did not have federal funding to pay benefits early this time around. Hall said food banks have been bracing for a spike in need. Local rules vary, but food banks generally don't have income requirements, so anyone experiencing long-term or temporary food insecurity can use them as a stopgap. The Trump administration will also have an opportunity to appeal. Trump's spending plan, which he signed into law in July, will reduce funding for federal nutrition aid like SNAP by nearly $200 billion over the next decade. The plan will also require nondisabled adults without dependents to fulfill work requirements until they reach age 64 to qualify for aid, up from the current cutoff age of 54. That work requirement change is scheduled to begin on November 1. An estimate from the Congressional Budget Office found that over 2 million Americans could lose SNAP coverage with these adjustments. "One month of SNAP really dwarfs our work, and no single charitable organization can fill that gap," Hall said. "And, indeed, no single ecosystem of food assistance is able to fill the gap made by SNAP."</p>
