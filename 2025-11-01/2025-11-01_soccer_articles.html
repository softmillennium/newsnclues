                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY (Nov. 1, 2025) – The final regular season match of what has been the most decorated season in club history thus far takes place Sunday, Nov. 2, when the Kansas City Current (20-3-2, 1st place, 62 pts.) hosts the San Diego Wave (10-8-7, 5th place, 37 pts) for Week 26 of National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) action. The game will serve as Fan Appreciation Day and limited tickets are available for purchase HERE. The match will broadcast nationally on ESPN with Jordan Angeli and Mark Donaldson on the call as well as on the World Feed with Jessica Charman and Gary Bailey. Fans in Kansas City can tune in to 90.9 The Bridge to hear Jillian Carroll Letrinko and Dave Borchardt call the action and the KC Current App will also have an audio stream of the match in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Kansas City Current forward Kristen Hamilton has announced her retirement from professional soccer, capping off a remarkable career which has included three NWSL championships and four NWSL Shields. Hamilton, who has been with Kansas City since its inaugural season in 2021, will hang up her boots at the conclusion of the 2025 campaign. The Current will celebrate Hamilton's illustrious career on Nov. 2 at CPKC Stadium during a post-match ceremony. A decorated veteran of the league, Hamilton has logged over 10,200 career minutes across all competitions, including 5,344 with the Current. She has 41 career goals and 14 assists in 184 appearances across all competitions. Twenty-six goals and 12 assists have been recorded in her 147 career regular season appearances, highlighted by 10 goals and two assists in 53 regular season games for Kansas City. Hamilton is one of four players in NWSL history who have been on four Shield-winning teams and she ranks second all-time with eight total NWSL trophies. She was also the first of only two players in league history to have played in five NWSL championship finals. Kansas City has won the last four meetings with San Diego and is 2-1 at home. Midfielder Debinha scored her 50th career regular season goal in the 16th minute off an assist from defender Izzy Rodriguez before midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta converted her penalty kick nine minutes later. 1 on ESPN's list of top Under-19 players in the NWSL. Get ready to see her at the 2027 World Cup and beyond for the USWNT.” At 19 years old, Hutton is in her second year as a professional and has played in all but one regular season matches this year. She currently ranks sixth on the team with 1,739 minutes and leads the roster with 41 tackles won, having also dished out a pair of assists. She was one of three teenagers called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for the latest FIFA international window, and the only teen to appear in all three matches. She is one of 26 women's finalists who received the most votes from their peers for their performances from Aug. 11, 2024, to Aug. 3, 2025, with a minimum of 20 matches played. In that time period, Debinha has amassed nine goals and five assists for the Kansas City Current. She became one of four players in NWSL history to be on four Shield-winning teams, and she ranks second all-time with eight NWSL trophies. The final World 11 list will be announced on Monday, Nov. 3. Kansas City is averaging 2.48 points per match through Week 25 and is on track to eclipse North Carolina's NWSL record for most points per match in a regular season of 2.38 set in 2018. 5 in the latest Opta Power Rankings from Oct. 30 with a score of 92.2. The next closest NWSL team, Gotham, was ranked 10th with a score of 87.6. Kansas City has conceded just 12 goals with one regular season match left to play. No team in NWSL history has allowed fewer than 17 goals over a full year, regardless of season length. The Current has allowed 0.48 goals per game through Week 25. The only other team that is conceding less than one goal per game on average is Gotham FC, which has given up 0.88 goals per game. Kansas City's stalwart defense is anchored by Brazilian netminder Lorena, whose 14th clean sheet on Oct. 11 broke Orlando's Anna Moorhouse's NWSL record of 13 for most goalkeeper shutouts in a single regular season. Lorena's 14 clean sheets not only extend her own single-season franchise record but set a new club mark for regular season career shutouts. Several KC Current players were busy during the October FIFA international window. Forward Bia Zaneratto scored the opening goal in the ninth minute before dishing out the game-winning assist nine minutes later during Brazil's 2-1 win vs. England on Oct. 25 before goalkeeper Lorena secured a 1-0 shutout over Italy on Oct. 28. Lorena started both matches in net and made a combined seven saves while Zaneratto started the first contest and subbed in during the second. In a 2-1 loss to Portugal on Oct. 23, forward Michelle Cooper started and logged 69 minutes while midfielder Claire Hutton subbed in during the second half. The Stars and Stripes responded on Oct. 26 with a 3-1 win over Portugal. Forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor registered her third career assist in the 82nd minute and played a full match as Hutton joined the starting lineup and logged 77 minutes. The first-ever USWNT match at CPKC Stadium took place Oct. 29 vs. New Zealand for a 6-0 U.S. win which saw Cooper and Hutton in the Starting XI logging 67 and 46 minutes, respectively. Additionally, a trio of young KC Current players in forwards Mary Long and Alex Pfeiffer along with defender Katie Scott participated in a U.S. Under-20 National Team training camp during the international break. The KC Current made history on Sept. 20 by winning the 2025 NWSL Shield, presented by CarMax, following its 2-0 win over Seattle Reign FC at CPKC Stadium. Kansas City defender Izzy Rodriguez – Rodriguez is tied for the league lead with six assists on the year. Her next regular season assist would set a new club single season record with seven and a new club record for career assists with 12. She is the only player on the roster who has appeared in all 25 matches and, if she plays Sunday, could become the first Kansas City Current player to ever play 26 matches in a season. Rodriguez, who scored her first goal of the year in Week 18, also leads the Current with 25 successful open play crosses and 54 corners. San Diego forward Delphine Cascarino – Cascarino paces San Diego with 11 goal contributions behind a team-leading five goals and six assists, the latter which is tied for first in the NWSL and set a new club record. She has had a goal contribution in three straight matches for the second time this season, equaling the longest single season streak in Wave history. She is the only San Diego player to contribute a goal in four consecutive regular season matches overall, doing so spanning the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Cascarino has started 22 of her 23 matches this season and ranks fifth on the roster with 1,896 minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explore our soccer expert's Liverpool vs Aston Villa predictions, pre Saturday's 4pm ET Premier League clash (11/01). Our betting expert expects a difficult evening for Liverpool, as they try to rediscover last season's form, with the result hanging in the balance. Liverpool have become renowned for their attacking football. Notably, 78% of their league matches this season produced goals at both ends. Villa will take advantage of that, especially because they've scored at least one goal in their last five matches. Additionally, four of Villa's last five road trips saw both teams score on the day. Emery's troops can capitalise on that and maybe register their first win against Liverpool in 10 attempts. The Reds are still favourites to win this one, having done so in six of their last seven at Anfield. However, only two of Villa's last nine league games have been won by the pre-match favourites. Top-flight English champions have suffered five-game losing streaks just seven times. Even if they don't get the three points, you can't help but feel the Villains might take something away this time. Although he had a quiet spell, Mo Salah finally got onto the scoresheet last weekend. The Egyptian has 275 goal involvements, and 13 of those have come against Villa. However, his personal record against the visitors is staggering. However, even if the Reds don't win, Salah remains a threat and may well score. What began as another dominant campaign for Liverpool has quickly gone off course. However, it's still way too early to rule the Reds out of successfully defending their 20th title. A defeat here would not only equal that record but also set an unwanted new one. Liverpool will join Leicester City as the only reigning Premier League champions to lose five consecutively. Meanwhile, Aston Villa have had quite an opposite season. After a slow and dismal start to the campaign, Unai Emery's men have found their rhythm once again. Following last weekend's victory over Man City, they have a chance to make a little history of their own. If they beat Liverpool, they'll become just the second team - after Leicester in their title-winning season - to beat both sides in consecutive gameweeks. Liverpool expected lineup: Mamardashvili, Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez, Szoboszlai, MacAllister, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Ekitike Aston Villa expected lineup: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne, Kamara, Onana, McGinn, Rogers, Guessand, Watkins</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The state has unveiled the Los Altos Tequila Route, a new tourism corridor that links eight highland towns known for producing some of Mexico's distinctive tequilas and for keeping alive the rural tradition behind them. This international tasting event brought producers and judges to Guadalajara, Tequila, Puerto Vallarta and several of the state's Pueblos Mágicos. With Guadalajara preparing to host matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Jalisco's tourism officials see an opportunity to set part of that global spotlight on the region's agricultural interior. For more than a decade, the original Tequila Route west of Guadalajara has drawn visitors to the namesake town and surrounding UENSCO-listed agave fields. The route connects Acatic, Tepatitlán, San Ignacio Cerro Gordo, Arandas, Jesús María, Atotonilco El Alto, Ayotlán and Tototlán, communities that together offer more than 1,600 rooms, 530 restaurants and 75 organized visitor experiences. Travelers can tour small-batch distilleries, stay at family haciendas or join workshops that walk them through every stage of tequila production, from hand-harvesting the piñas to barrel aging and tasting. In Arandas, construction has begun on Mundo de Don Julio, a cultural complex that will include a restaurant, museum and guided experiences celebrating one of Mexico's most recognized labels. To the south, El Tesoro de los Altos by Campo Azul is being developed as a countryside retreat with cabins overlooking the fields, ATV excursions, and blending workshops led by local distillers. Nearby, Farm-to-Table by Tequila San Matías will showcase regional ingredients — corn, goat cheese, chiles and fresh herbs — served with tequila pairings and talks on sustainable agriculture. And at Casa Loy, outside Tepatitlán, chefs are designing menus that connect contemporary Mexican cooking with traditional highland spirits. Tequila received 1.2 million visitors in 2023, a 19% increase from 2019. While that period includes the pandemic years, when international travel slowed, it's worth noting that Mexico was one of the few countries to keep its borders open. The new highlands circuit could help balance that flow, but whether it can divert enough travelers from established destinations to make a measurable difference in overcrowding remains to be seen. What's clear, however, is that there is real demand for tequila-related experiences, and the highlands offer a way to expand the narrative beyond one small, over-visited town. Guadalajara will serve as one of Mexico's three host cities, and tourism authorities estimate that the tournament could bring an additional five million visitors nationwide and generate several billion dollars in tourism spending. Road improvements, new signage, and a digital map are in the works to make the circuit easier for self-guided travelers. Tequila remains one of Mexico's most lucrative exports, generating nearly US $4 billion in 2024, according to the Tequila Regulatory Council. But much of that profit still flows to large-scale producers. The Los Altos initiative aims to integrate smaller distilleries, agave farmers and local entrepreneurs into the formal tourism network. Community cooperatives and municipal governments are collaborating on training programs for guides, restaurateurs and homestay owners to help professionalize services while keeping management local. Preserving that legacy has become central to the route's long-term vision. Participating distilleries are adopting water-recycling systems, composting agave waste and restoring native vegetation around their fields. Many of the new visitor programs include lessons on biodiversity and reforestation. The state's Sustainable Tourism Council has said that it will oversee certification to ensure that growth does not compromise environmental standards. Los Altos is one element of a larger push to diversify Jalisco's food and beverage tourism. Two wine routes are also being developed in the highlands. Together, these projects are pointing to a new phase in Jalisco's tourism model, one that has traditionally relied on sun-and-sand tourism. Visitors driving the route will pass small roadside distilleries, open-air markets and fields where jimadores still harvest by hand. For the communities of Los Altos, the hope is that attention may bring recognition and a more sustainable future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup, kicking off June 11 across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, will feature 48 teams in 104 matches over 39 days, coinciding with America's 250th anniversary. While the event was expected to spark surging hotel demand in host cities, its impact has so far fallen short of expectations, more so in the United States to date, especially as prices for U.S. World Cup tickets are significantly more expensive than in Canada and Mexico. Tighter borders, trade tensions, and stricter visa requirements are driving a decline in U.S. tourism, affecting sectors ranging from hospitality to construction. Experts point to several factors behind the slowdown, but with nine months remaining, the U.S. hotel industry could see a sharp rebound in bookings after the final draw and full match schedule are released on December 5. Hospitality data firm Lighthouse reports that length-of-stay rules have limited hotel inventory for FIFA 2026, with occupancy in most host cities still in single digits, nine months before the event. Despite differing price surges across regions, average room rates remain well above typical 2026 levels and higher than the same period in 2025, signaling what Lighthouse calls a “clear anticipation of future demand.” "When viewed in context, current booking levels are higher than normal for this time of year, but still far below what a World Cup host market would typically expect," the report states. There is also a projected dip in international travel spending in the U.S. for 2025, with more restrictive visa conditions and tighter border procedures. For hotels in U.S. host cities, the FIFA World Cup has driven aggressive pricing strategies and heightened expectations, with year-over-year rate growth outpacing the national average. The report indicates that, while current booking levels exceed typical figures for this time of year, they remain significantly below what's expected for a World Cup host market. With roughly six million tickets, about 85%, still available, and several factors weighing on early demand, the main hotel booking surge, particularly in the U.S., is yet to come. The report also notes that many hotels appear unavailable during the tournament, either due to length-of-stay restrictions or withheld inventory. With both hotels and fans “on pause” until the final ticket draw on December 5, a surge in bookings is expected once fans learn where their teams will play. “Many hotels are holding back inventory and setting minimum-stay requirements in anticipation of higher-value bookings later,” the report also said. FIFA has also announced that its resale site is now open, and tickets for the World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are available on the FIFA website at prices ranging from $9,538 to $57,500 per seat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool manager Arne Slot addressed talk of him losing his job amid the Reds' torrid run of form as pressure cranks up on the Dutch manager. The reigning English champions got off to a flying start in their title defence campaign but are now struggling for form as they have lost six out of their last seven matches across all competitions and are already seven points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. Slot further bolstered his attack by securing a transfer for Hugo Ekitike, while he replaced Real Madrid-bound Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong. However, since their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on September 27, Slot's side has lost six out of seven matches, including four consecutive defeats in the league. They have fallen to seventh position in the table and are as many points behind league leaders Arsenal. Amid the club's poor run of form, there has been speculation over Slot's future at Anfield and the Dutchman has now addressed talk of him getting sacked. "For me they say similar things," the Liverpool head coach said. We always talk about the game and it's always nicer to talk about the game if you have won than if you have lost. "[I feel supported] not only in this period but also when things go well. Tell me if I'm wrong but I think during the week [the reaction] was about when I said something about the squad we are having, and that could have been seen as criticising or an excuse? "What I meant was, if these players are all fit we have so much quality. But – I've used Alex (Alexander Isak) as an example but I don't want to go into every single player because players sometimes don't like it when they are named as being fit or not – not all of them were ready from the start to play three games in seven days. "And then when you get four injuries like we have at the moment, it is a struggle going into a programme like this. I did it because Ibou (Ibrahima Konate) and Virgil (van Dijk) had to play a lot. Joe Gomez missed out on the whole of pre-season. Macca (Alexis Mac Allister) missed out on the whole of pre-season." When asked about the potential for a contract extension rather than an exit, Slot added: "That is the last question I was expecting. I think my focus can be completely on getting Liverpool back to winning ways. The second answer is that contract talks, if they are even there, we never speak about this here. But let us first start to win again, that's where my main focus is."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neil Ryan will hope to repeat England's Under-17 World Cup final triumph eight years ago this week Carlos Rodrigues - The FA/The FA via Getty Images Marc Guehi, Conor Gallagher, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Phil Foden and Morgan Gibbs-White are all in contention to be a part of Thomas Tuchel's England side bidding to be crowned world champions next July in the United States. Jadon Sancho, Emile Smith Rowe and Angel Gomes also featured, and have also gone on to wear the Three Lions at senior level. Not all of the party who travelled to that tournament in India went on to have such glittering careers — Curtis Anderson, the goalkeeper who was the hero of a penalty shootout victory against Japan in the round of 16, has given up the pro game and now works as financial advisor helping guide young players on what to do with their money, and several others have forged only modest careers in the lower leagues — but that side's collective achievement still serves as inspiration to the teenage generations following in their footsteps. Another crop of England Under-17s are about to try to repeat that feat in the age group's latest World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar on Monday. Former Manchester United youth coach Neil Ryan's England will compete against 47 other nations to lift the trophy on November 27, and he believes this experience could be invaluable in the development of players who have yet to experience big-game environments and atmospheres. Of course, there are players who haven't gone on to have such amazing careers, so you see the challenges they still face. There is certainly no guarantee this team will go on to play for the seniors in the future, but what you want to do is give them experience, put them under the pressure of a big tournament. Hopefully, at the end of it, they will go back to their clubs and it will aid them as they progress along the pathway to senior football.” It means that if they are eventually good enough to step up to senior level, the only thing that will be a shock to them will be the bigger stage. In 2014, the under-17s won that age group's European Championship. As well as that Under-17 World Cup in 2017, the under-20s also won their version and the under-19s were crowned European champions. Since 2014, the full England side have also got to two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final but are yet to lift silverware. “If our boys can do well at these tournaments, get that experience, that is something that you would hope eventually they can take with them to the seniors, and to the big tournaments,” Ryan says. England had to come through a tough qualifying campaign to reach this World Cup, and there is never a guarantee that they will be part of every age-group tournament going forward. They will also be facing some unknowns: there will be the heat of Qatar to acclimatise to, even though, as with the 2022 senior World Cup, it is being staged in the northern hemisphere's winter when temperatures in the Gulf state are lower than in summer and they held a warm-weather training camp in Cadiz, southern Spain, in September. England are in Group E, and will face Venezuela in their opening game on Tuesday, November 4, Haiti three days later and Egypt next Monday, November 10. If they are successful, it could mean playing a total of eight games in 23 days with a 21-strong squad, fewer than managers get for a senior World Cup, that includes three goalkeepers. “Our boys have not played these opponents in the group stages before, and they'll all bring such different challenges for us — the cultures, the different styles of play,” Ryan says. “Each game brings its pressure to both nations, and the world is watching. We will be prepared, but there is still that unknown element to it, and we want to do ourselves justice by knowing how well these boys can perform, make sure they perform and go out there and give themselves the best chance. Goalkeepers Lanre Awesu (West Ham United), Dylan Moody (Southampton), Jack Porter (Arsenal). Midfielders Bradley Burrowes (Aston Villa), Landon Emenalo (Chelsea), Reigan Heskey, ⁠Ryan McAidoo, Harrison Miles (all Manchester City), Louis Page (Leicester City), Seth Ridgeon (Fulham), Tynan Thompson (Tottenham Hotspur), Reggie Walsh (Chelsea), Luca Williams-Barnett (Tottenham Hotspur). Strikers Chizaram Ezenwata (Chelsea), Alejandro Rodriguez (Olympique Lyonnais), Igor Tyjon (Blackburn Rovers).
