                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Presented by TV and Film producer Dan Farah, the doc suggests that the United States have been subject to an 80 year cover-up, and includes interviews with multiple senior government officials. Rubio, a major Donald Trump ally, appears in the documentary and states that UFOs have been spotted flying over restricted nuclear facilities. He says in the trailer: “We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it's not ours." Stratton was the former director of the government's UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) Task Force and confirms that he has seen both alien craft and alien beings. He went on to add: “Clearly, the facts around this topic have been covered up for 80 years and kept from the public, and every single high-level, credible person I interviewed did not think that was right. The film has been highly touted, but some who have seen it so far are skeptical about the claims. Whilst Variety's Owen Gleiberman acknowledged that they ‘want to believe', they were not convinced by the arguments outlined in the doc. “It's that there couldn't be experts debunking anything here. “If somebody insists, without evidence, that there's an underground bunker somewhere with a thousand alien bodies and 50 alien spacecraft, it's impossible for anybody to refute.” For those X-Files fans who want to believe and thus want to judge for themselves however, the documentary will release on Prime Video November 21.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's an unidentified flying object straight out of the imagination of Stanley Kubrick or Ridley Scott, spaceships beyond Orion, C-rays glowing in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. Miriam Bäckström (Stockholm, 1967) is all this and nothing at the same time. Let's try to make sense of all this. His post-photographic work goes beyond a camera shot. The resulting image is converted into a weave and this is woven in silk, lurex and jacquard. Then this fabric becomes skin in new ways, 3D modeled geometries whose skeleton is made of wood. The result is not a photograph glued to a volume, but an image that becomes matter. Bäckström declines photography as open source. Elba Benítez hosts few but emphatic pieces, only four. one of them Advanced Cone (2019) looks like a ten-meter alien object. Pieces that are at the same time raster, pixel and skin: They are reminiscent of heat shields or armor plates seen by the camera of a space probe. It is not illustrative science fiction, but poetic engineering. His work consisted of photographing interior spaces such as apartments, restaurants and galleries, with great technical precision and without explicit human presence, but evoking their imprint as if they were settings in search of characters. Over time, these sets took her towards the theatre, cinema, performance and, more recently, textile art. Bäckström represented Sweden at the 2005 Venice Biennale (along with Carsten Höller) and has made tapestries for the Swedish royal house (Palace of Frederick VIII, official residence of the Danish royal family), public spaces and museums, and his work appears in collections such as Tate, Guggenheim, MoMA, or Moderna Museet. That, and nothing else, is the postphotographygo beyond the shot, be able to transform language. His works envelop the viewer in a hypnotic plot like the moiré of a fabric or the snow on an untuned television screen. When we move, our brain reads the plot as if it were in motion; when surrounding the pieces, the shine It turns on and off as if the fabric were breathing. Your email address will not be published.

Astronomers analyzing observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the W. M. Keck Observatory have discovered further unusual features of our third interstellar visitor, and confirmed the presence of a rare "anti-solar tail". On July 1, 2025, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object making its way through our Solar System. What was unusual, and highly interesting, was that the object appeared to be the fastest object of this type ever observed, and had an eccentricity of between 6.1 and 6.2. An eccentricity greater than 1 means it is an interstellar visitor, the third we have found so far, and will leave our Solar System once more. 3I/ATLAS has been subject to (dubious) speculation that it is not a natural object. Though there is little reason to suspect 3I/ATLAS is anything other than a natural object, it is of high interest to scientists and the public alike, having traveled alone through interstellar space for possibly 10 billion years. Interstellar objects enable similar studies for otherwise inaccessible stellar systems." By analyzing the spectra of light reflected off the comet, astronomers can figure out what elements and compounds it contains. We already have a few puzzles presented by 3I/ATLAS in this regard, with a previous paper finding it has an "extreme abundance ratio" of iron/nickel. "Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of Solar System comets, even at large heliocentric distances. "The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals." While the chemical ratios are unusual, perhaps this is to be expected from an object which may be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. “At the distances at which comets are observed, the temperature is far too low to vaporize silicate, sulfide, and metallic grains that contain nickel and iron atoms,” the team added. “Therefore, the presence of nickel and iron atoms in cometary coma is extremely puzzling.” The team suggests that nickel, which spreads out to around 594 kilometers (369 miles) and far less than cyanide at 841 kilometers (523 miles), may be released by an intermediate "parent" molecule which is quickly broken apart by solar radiation. These molecules are easily unbound by absorbing light and may produce centrally concentrated Ni, as observed in 3I/ATLAS," the team writes. As well as this the team found other mysteries, including that the production rate of nickel relative to cyanide is "higher than 2I/Borisov and orders of magnitude above the solar system comet median.” One particularly interesting aspect of the comet is that it has developed an "anti-tail" or "anti-solar tail", which is a tail pointed towards the Sun, backed up by the new paper. Previously, sometimes-controversial Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb caused controversy (see) by suggesting in a paper with colleague Eric Keto, "This phenomenon, observed at a distance of 3.8 au from the Sun, is not common and possibly observed for the first time in 3I/ATLAS." However, before you suggest aliens like Loeb, it is not entirely unheard of. "While such a morphology is certainly unusual – given that dust tails are typically directed antisolar due to radiation pressure acting on dust grains – it is not without precedent among distant active bodies," a paper on the topic explains. "Notably, Farnham et al. (2021) reported a similar sunward enhancement in comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli–Bernstein), which they interpreted as the result of the slow ejection of relatively large dust particles predominantly from the sunlit hemisphere." As always, more observations of these objects are needed to learn about them, and the environments they evolved in. We will learn more by looking for more interstellar objects, something that will hopefully become easier when the Vera C. Rubin Telescope begins searching the skies. The study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, is posted to preprint server arXiv. Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The facts had changed so MPs simply amended their conspiracy theories to fit the new evidence If Keir Starmer thought that releasing the three witness statements of the deputy national security adviser (DNSA) Matthew Collins late on Wednesday night was going to make the China spy case row go away, then he was in for a big disappointment. There was no way MPs were going to let a story like this out of their clutches. This was their moment to take centre stage. When they could bathe in their own importance. When they could believe that they and national security were one and the same thing. There again, whatever Starmer had put into the public domain would never have been enough. Even a letter from the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, falling on his sword and admitting he had taken his eye off the ball, would have been dismissed as irrelevant. When it comes to a choice between cock-up and conspiracy, most MPs naturally gravitate to conspiracy. Life's too dull when it's just some unelected apparatchik doing a job badly. As the facts change, MPs merely change their conspiracy theories to fit the new evidence. In her embarrassing tirades at Wednesday's prime minister's questions, Kemi Badenoch had insisted that Starmer was at the centre of a major cover-up. That he was basically a Chinese spy himself, doing the bidding of his masters in Beijing. Come Thursday morning, that particular narrative appeared dead in the water. There was just no evidence to support it. Because another conspiracy theory was at hand. In this exciting new version, it was Starmer's lack of involvement, his failure to nobble Collins that was compelling proof the prime minister was a Chinese stooge. A true red, white and blue patriot would have done whatever it took to secure a conviction. Putting a gun to Collins's and Parkinson's heads. Not that there was any recognition that the terms of reference for the conspiracy theory had just done a U-turn. On days like these politicians imagine themselves to be a tabula rasa. All that matters is what happens today. So it was almost inevitable there would be an urgent question in the Commons to give MPs a platform to air their new theories that had been developed overnight. You can generally gauge how much trouble the government reckons it is in by the minister it sends out to answer a UQ. Get a cabinet minister and the government is supremely confident of its position. And, to be fair, Ward did about as well as could be expected under the circumstances. He didn't die on his arse and only had to endure a modicum of faux pity from opposition MPs. It's just that he would much rather have been anywhere than in the Commons at 10.30 on a Thursday morning. It wasn't so much that he had nothing much to say – which he didn't really – it was more that he knew nothing he did have to say was going to make much difference. Try telling a UFO convention that UFOs don't exist will only make the audience even more convinced they do. All he could do was stand up and read the words in front of him. He wasn't entirely sure why Collins had added a line from the Labour manifesto about China being an economic opportunity. Presumably to give context that Labour's line on China was not that much different to the Tories. Then the onslaught, First from shadow minister for policy renewal, Neil O'Brien. To a layperson, this sounded very much like expecting the government to fabricate new evidence if the existing material was insufficient. But maybe spy trials don't count. There again, surely the Met could have knocked something up. They are old hands at that sort of thing. Emily Thornberry couldn't work out why the CPS had not just backed off and let a jury decide on the guilt. Just because the spies passed on information freely available elsewhere and gossip picked up in the coffee queue in Portcullis House, this didn't mean it was any less serious. This was MPs we were talking about. Tory Tom Tugendhat, one of the two MPs targeted, begged the prime minister to come to his rescue. How could he have abandoned Tom by not leaning more heavily on Collins? What was the point of being prime minister if you didn't bang up spies? Bernard Jenkin refused to believe Collins wasn't nobbled in some way. Bernie couldn't explain whether he had been nobbled to keep quiet or write rubbish witness statements. Jeremy Wright and Nick Timothy wanted the spies banged up regardless of whether they were guilty or not. Or that the case would have still collapsed if they had been in power. Ward just stood there and took it all. Come the end, there were points of order from Alicia Kearns, another spyee, Tugendhat and Graham Stuart. Stuart asked for an expression of sympathy to be shown towards Ward. A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar. On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.</p>

In his time at Collider, he has also helped drive diversity by writing stories about the multiple Indian film industries, with a goal to introduce audiences to a whole new world of cinema. Much has been written and revealed about the near-miraculous achievement of getting a television show off the ground. Anybody that is able to do so can consider themselves incredibly lucky; fewer can claim to have created a show that stands the test of time. And even fewer have gone on to create multiple hits. The Leftovers recently debuted in several European territories, and instantly secured a spot for itself on the HBO Max global viewership charts. Starring Justin Theroux and Carrie Coon, the show originally debuted in 2014, and was tragically canceled after just three seasons. However, Lindelof was allowed to conclude it on his own terms. While the first season proved to be divisive, the second and third seasons were hailed as landmark television. The Leftovers was acclaimed for its philosophical tone, and for its sweeping themes of grief, loss, and love. Lindelof followed The Leftovers up with his "remix" of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' seminal comic book Watchmen. The show ran, as intended, for one season. However, HBO has left the door open for Lindelof to pick it back up if he so desires. Since then, he has co-created the Peacock series Mrs. Davis, starring Betty Gilpin. The show ran for an eight-episode debut season, and there are currently no plans to bring it back. You can watch The Leftovers at home, and stay tuned to Collider for more updates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr Robin Corbet, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, thinks aliens got bored of trying to find us and simply stopped looking. 'In the mundane perspective, where other civilizations are not that much more advanced, a limit to exploration would arise,' said Dr Corbet. The expert says Proxima Centauri b – a planet in another solar system 4 light years away – could be a 'promising' location for life to exist. For decades, sci-fi films and comics have depicted aliens as sophisticated civilizations using technology beyond our comprehension. This may have fueled the assumption that they are capable of successfully beaming messages to other planets, including our own. For example, they could send out 'swarms of interstellar robotic probes' or powerful beacons in the form of light or sound that could be detected across the galaxy. Films like 'ET' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' even suggest they're able to visit other worlds in their high-powered spaceships. In fact, their technology may not include 'significant leaps equivalent to harnessing electricity or rely on as yet unknown laws of physics', he says in his paper. Even if aliens do have a capable beacon transmitter, it is not clear that there would be 'much motivation' to operate it for millions or billions of years until their signal is noticed. The universe is mind-bogglingly vast and we have only explored a very tiny fragment of it, so there's bound to be some other form of life out there. So the very fact we exist here on Earth would make it incredibly unlikely that nowhere else in the universe has some kind of conscious life too. However, some detractors cite the Fermi paradox - the fact there's a lack of evidence for extraterrestrials despite various high estimates for their probability. In other words, if there is alien life, why have we not found any evidence for it? In effect, the paradox asks, if there is so much extraterrestrial life, why have we not found any evidence for it? Alternatively, some aliens do have the technology but are so far away from us to make it impossible. 'The Fermi paradox may be explained if the galaxy contains a modest number of technological civilizations, with technology levels that, while more advanced than contemporary Earth, are nowhere near the 'super-science' levels that could result in readily detectable astro-engineering,' Dr Corbet concludes in his paper, yet to be peer-reviewed. While it might sound compelling, Professor Michael Garrett, director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics in Manchester, voiced reservations regarding the radically mundane theory. 'I find it hard to believe that all intelligent life would be so uniformly dull.' Dr Gordon Gallup, a biopsychologist at the University of Albany, said in a 2022 paper: 'If there is intelligent life elsewhere, they may view humans as extremely dangerous. 'Maybe this is why there is no proof or compelling evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence – we pose too great a risk, and they do not want to be discovered.' On Earth, scientists have already tried to beam messages towards other solar systems in radio or light signals, akin to sending information in an email via the internet. 'And there are many ways to send signals of a kind that do not get changed by any natural process, so another civilization would see them as coming from an intelligence,' he told the Daily Mail. The Fermi Paradox questions why, given the estimated 200-400 billion stars and at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy, there have been no signs of alien life. The contradiction is named after its creator, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. Fermi believed it was too extraordinary that a single extra-terrestrial signal or engineering project has yet to be detected in the universe — despite its immense vastness. Fermi concluded there must a barrier that limits the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced space-colonising civilisations. This barrier is sometimes referred to as the 'Great Filter'. Professor Brian Cox believes the advances in science and engineering required by a civilisation to start conquering the stars will ultimately lead to its destruction. Other possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox include that intelligent alien species are out there, but lack the necessary technology to communicate with Earth. Some believe that the distances between intelligent civilisations are too great to allow any kind of two-way communication. If two worlds are separated by several thousand light years, it's possible that one or both civilisations would become extinct before a dialogue can be established. The so-called Zoo hypothesis claims intelligent alien life is out there, but deliberately avoids any contact with life on Earth to allow its natural evolution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Johnny Dodd is a senior writer at PEOPLE, who focuses on human interest, crime and sports stories. After months of speculation — and even frustration — from fans over why their much-anticipated UFO documentary The Age Of Disclosure hadn't yet been released, producers have announced a date for its commercial launch. The documentary features dozens of prominent voices from the U.S. government, military and intelligence communities as it sets out to corroborate a purported 80-year global coverup of non-human intelligent life. Disclosure drew huge audiences at the SXSW Film Festival, which helped push its trailer to more than 20 million views. Now it will be released on Nov. 21 for a theatrical run in New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. “I had to make this film in secrecy and faced numerous hurdles because there are people who would prefer that this film not exist," he says. "I could not be prouder for the world to see it.” Their first-hand accounts — such as those from Jay Stratton, former director of the government's unidentified aerial phenomena task force — are both intriguing and disturbing. “I ask people to think about why would any of these extremely high-level people like our Secretary of State [Marco Rubio] have to gain by participating in this film and shedding light on this?” Farrah told PEOPLE earlier this year. Mike Rounds and Kirsten Gillibrand on the issue — recently said. “The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence and unexplainable phenomena,” Schumer said. Disclosure, according to Farah (who produced Spielberg's 2018 sci-fi action feature Ready Player One), comes on the heels of a paradigm shift in the way Americans think about UAPs, once seen as a fringe issue. “We interviewed dozens of very high-level, credible officials who said these unknown threats [posed by UAPs] could basically destroy our way of life forever,” Farah previously told PEOPLE.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The film will also get awards-qualifying theatrical screenings in Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C. The Age of Disclosure has earned a limited theatrical run in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to quality for Oscar season and an exclusive VOD streaming release on Prime Video. A new trailer for the project (below) was released Thursday. 'The Age of Disclosure' Review: Dan Farah's Polished Doc Legitimizes Unverifiable Theories About UFOs The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. The film comes amid a series of headline-making bipartisan Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) calling for transparency about what the government might know about non-human intelligent life. “Amazing documentary, I really hope that gets released somewhere big,” Rogan has said. They think this documentary is going to break the dam. It's pretty intense.” The Hollywood Reporter‘s review was more skeptical. (“The Age of Disclosure tackles its topic with utmost certainty and sincerity, its interview subjects treating everything they say like it's established fact, not requiring corroboration or confirmation,” critic Daniel Fienberg wrote.) Some of the officials interviewed include Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to UFOs, “even presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis”), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama). So I went to great lengths to make this documentary in secret over the last two-and-a-half years … there are these fundamental facts — like that we're not alone in the universe — that everyone feels like the public has the right to know, and it's also in our best interest to make known so that there's no longer this antiquated, unjust stigma that is making our country fall behind in how seriously this topic is taken.” Farah's producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This period, however, made many of us suspicious. Rather than focus our enmity on mysterious foes overseas, we turned inward, looking at our own institutions with suspicion. Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson) was the skeptic, always insisting that there is a logical, scientific reason that something may look supernatural. Scully retained her skepticism, even after seeing weird creatures with Mulder every week. It was sensational and smart at the same time. It was a reflection of the time. It's no wonder that the world's many X-Philes dislike all the show's seasons that aired after 2000. I say declaratively that seasons 7 through 11 are not essential. Well, with one exception, as we'll see below. Note: this will not merely be a list of the "funny" episodes. The bulk of "The X-Files" consisted of monster-of-the-week episodes, wherein Mulder and Scully would investigate a creature, supernatural killer, or some other fantastical beast. This stood in contrast to the "arc" episodes, wherein the stalwart FBI agents would further look into an ever-widening conspiracy within the government to hide aliens, technology, and evidence of mass abductions. The story followed a mysterious man named Eugene Victor Tooms (Doug Hutchison), a Baltimoran with the mysterious ability to stretch and squeeze his body through tiny openings. He used this ability to slide through air vents and attack people, killing them and removing their livers. Mulder and Scully manage to apprehend Tooms and give him a polygraph test, linking him to murders from nearly a century before. It's eventually revealed that Tooms is not a human, but some other kind of humanoid creature that hibernates in a subterranean nest for 30-year periods. It only awakens to rebuild its next, eat a few human livers, and go back to sleep. Tooms is a scary monster with a unique ability, and showed that "The X-Files" wasn't going to rely on traditional cryptids like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. It was fully willing to be scary and gross on its own terms. If the first two episodes didn't grab you, then "Squeeze" assured you would become an "X-Files" addict for years to come. "Paper Clip" was the third part of a three-episode arc that also included "Anasazi" and "The Blessing Way," and it opened up the show's third season with a bang. This three-episode arc was also a sequel story of sorts to a two-parter from the show's second season that included "Duane Barry" and "Ascension" (October 14 and 21, 1994). Really, this spot is a five-way tie between those episodes. In 1994, Gillian Anderson became pregnant and needed to step away from the series for a spell. Show creator Chris Carter came up with an arc wherein Scully was kidnapped, leaving Mulder on his own. That last-minute cover ended up inspiring a larger story arc about a deep conspiracy in the FBI, which may have proven the existence of alien greys, and how the U.S. government was secretly using alien technology. Oh yes, and there was the weaselly Agent Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom some X-Philes referred to as Ratboy. But at this point in the series, the conspiracies were still comprehensible and seemed large and important. "Paper Clip" was proof that "The X-Files" could work with larger, outsize stories that felt incredibly important and salient. "Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'" (April 12, 1996) might have been the first proper "comedy" episode of "The X-Files." In it, the immortal Charles Nelson Reilly played the titular Jose Chung, an author who is writing a book about alien abductions. He interviews Scully about a recent case of hers, and finds that her job can be a little kooky from time to time. Jose also interviews a few other assorted kooks and diner owners, and finds that Mulder and Scully appear, from the outside, to be part of the shadowy conspiracies they fight against. This is the episode wherein Scully performs an alien autopsy only to find that she's dissecting an alien suit being worn by a very human military pilot. This is also the episode wherein Alex Trebek and Jesse Ventura appear as mysterious Men in Black, and Mulder is said to screech like an alien when he sees a crashed UFO. It's the episode where an alien abductee, while being held in a cage on an alien spacecraft, looks over into the cell next to them and sees another alien, locked up, smoking a cigarette and repeating, "This is not happening." But, it seems, the business of alien abduction is so whimsical and absurd that its publication would discredit the actual investigators of UFOlogy. "Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'" cleverly makes light of "The X-Files," openly acknowledging that the complex conspiracies on the show will sound oblique and ridiculous to any outsiders. "Home" (October 11, 1996) is another monster-of-the-week episode, but it may be the show's creepiest and most effective. Mulder and Scully travel to Home, Pennsylvania, to investigate the exhumed corpse of a severely mutated infant found buried in a baseball park. Mulder suspects that the infant's death might have something to do with the mutated Peacock brothers who live nearby. "Home" has the same sort of villains as Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" from over 20 years earlier, but told in an "X-Files" way, with a deep conspiracy and a need to find the truth. When Mulder and Scully find what they find underneath the Peacock Bros. bed, it's shocking and horrifying. It's not supernatural, but it certainly is unusual, and plays into decades of lurid urban legends about the backwater areas of the United States. Have something lighthearted and fun to watch after "Home," because it may leave you a little shaken. This may be a controversial choice, as "Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster" (February 1, 2016) aired during the poorly received two-season revival of "The X-Files" that aired in 2016 and in 2018. Real-world government conspiracies about torture, faked weapons reports, and ill-advised wars were more important than the fantasy aliens seen in the 1990s, so "The X-Files" was instantly behind-the-times. Only "Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster" managed to address the nature of the FBI agents' work, and what function they still played decades after their glory days. It seems that Guy Mann is a bipedal lizard being who lived happily in the woods with vague animal intelligence. Mulder witnesses Guy transforming, giving him proof that the supernatural is out there. They just want to live their lives. Maybe, Mulder didn't need to expose the truth. Maybe he can just let the monsters be.</p>

The unexpected smell of sweet lavender in the room, the eerie sounds of violin music playing in the distance, or that creepy feeling of being watched. There are a number of unsettling incidents that have happened at the White House.

America's most historic address, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, DC, is also arguably the most well-known haunted house in the United States. In one particularly well-known instance, presidents, first ladies, White House employees and visitors have all claimed experiencing ghostly experiences, hearing strange sounds and even encountering real apparitions while leaving the bathtub, according to History.com.

Here are a few of the odd ghostly experiences that former occupants, staff and guests have had while at the White House:

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy. The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process. Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo. The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed. “HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email. The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment. High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California. “It's done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that.” DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment. Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended. “This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine. “It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany's memo states. Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain. But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say. Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods. Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. “Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,” the agency says on its website. Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said. In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast” involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring. The title track on singer Lana Del Ray's seventh studio album is entitled “Chemtrails Over the Country Club.” Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast “Club Random,” saying, “This is nuts. It's just nuts.” And “Chemtrails,” a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July. Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say. More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they've received death threats. The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago. “I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.” While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy. The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth's climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process. Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo. The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed. “HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email. The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn't respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment. High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven't occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California. “It's done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military's use. We're bringing on somebody who's going to think only about that.” DARPA officials didn't return a message seeking comment. Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended. “This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine. “It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation's citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany's memo states. Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain. But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn't possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say. Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn't have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A year ago today, the world was left reeling by the shocking news of former One Direction member Liam Payne's tragic fall from a hotel balcony. Yet, even after a year, investigators are still trying to unravel the mystery surrounding Payne's last hours in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was alone at the time, as his girlfriend Kate Cassidy, 26, had already flown back home. Charges have been levelled against a hotel employee and a waiter, but many questions remain unanswered, leaving the star's family in a painful limbo as they await full details about the events leading up to his untimely demise. Payne, aged 31, met his tragic end after falling from the third floor of the Casa Sur Palmero Hotel around 5pm local time on 16 October 2024. However, a toxicology report also revealed traces of cocaine, alcohol, and prescription antidepressants in his system. In the aftermath of his death, Payne's friend Rogelio 'Roger" Nores, hotel operator Gilda Martin, and receptionist Esteban Grassi were initially charged with manslaughter, but these charges were later dropped. However, charges against hotel employee Ezequiel Pereyra and waiter Braian Paiz, who stand accused of supplying cocaine to Payne, still stand. Both men deny the charges but have been held in police custody since January. Case's ongoing mysteries A trial date has yet to be established for Pereyra and Paiz, as Argentine authorities continue sifting through 800 hours of CCTV material, mobile phone data and laptop content, meaning neither defendant has been able to present their version of events regarding their encounters with Liam in court. The duo were officially charged in June, with prosecutors claiming they provided Payne with narcotics on at least two occasions during the two weeks preceding his death. Security camera footage allegedly captures Payne requesting "seven grams more" from Pereyra during a brief lift encounter at the hotel on the day he died. Under Argentine law, the prosecution must present evidence to a judge, who determines whether proceedings advance to trial or if charges are dismissed. The publication reports that one suspect's mobile was used to contact Payne in the days before his death, yet wasn't examined until May, despite being seized as evidence in November. Should they be convicted, Pereyra and Paiz face up to 15 years behind bars. Paiz has acknowledged supplying Payne with cocaine, but refutes accepting payment, which forms the basis of his charges.
